Chapter 6: Breaking Down Questions — How to Identify
Exactly What the ACT is Asking You
The most important skill for success on the Reading Test is effectively breaking down each question to

identify exactly what the ACT is asking you. Many students believe that they are doing are already doing
this, but most are not doing it effectively enough or at all.
Let us give you an example to better explain what we mean. Imagine that you are taking an ACT Reading Test
and are working on a question. You read the question and to go back to the passage to look for the evidence.
All of the sudden, I reach across the table and take your ACT away and ask you, “what exactly are you looking
for?” If you cannot tell me EXACTLY what you are looking for, you are not doing a good enough job

breaking down the question. And if you are not doing a good enough job breaking down the question, you do
not know exactly what the ACT is asking, which of course makes it much more difficult to consistently find
the correct answer and means that you are wasting time!
In this chapter, we will teach you the skills and methods that you need to effectively break down questions and
identify exactly what you are looking for when you go to the passage. The better you get at breaking down
questions, the easier the Reading Test becomes. In addition, you will improve your time management
skills and answer more questions correctly.

Skill #1 — Identify the Type of Question
When you read a question, you first need to identify the type of question. You should memorize all the key
words and approaches we learned in Chapter 5 to make identifying question types easy. Knowing what
type of question you are looking at is critical to knowing how to approach the question and the type of
evidence to look for in the passage.

Skill #2 — Identify the Keywords
To find the evidence in the passage quickly, we want to identify the keyword(s) in the question. The
keyword(s) are the words or phrases that we can skim for in the passage. On the ACT, the keyword(s) from
the question are almost always right nearby the evidence. If you can find the keyword(s) in the passage, the
evidence is almost always right nearby. The keywords are like little flags saying, ““Look over here for the
evidence!” After you find the keyword(s), use the 2-sentence rule — read the 2 sentences before and 2
sentences after. If you find the keyword(s) and use the 2-sentence rule, you will be able to find your
Waldo and answer the question correctly.

Identifying Keywords
AS you read a question, we recommend that you underline the important keyword(s) in the question.

Once the keywords are underlined, you will know what words or phrases to skim for in the passage.
1.

Inthe passage, the narrator describes a

2.

The passage suggests that one difference

brick wall of an abandoned restaurant as:

between a white dwarf and a red giant is

A. trying to escape the rest of the

that a red giant:

building.

A.

is more often studied with a

B.

telling a story.

photometer.

C.

hiding behind a layer of paint.

B.

has a larger inner core.

D.

being a good listener.

C.

relies more on helium for fuel.

D.

has a higher surface temperature.

In the first example above, “brick wall” and “abandoned restaurant” are the keywords. We should also notice
that this is a clear evidence questions since it starts with “in the passage.” If you can find where the passage
discusses the brick wall of the abandoned restaurant, the Waldo should be right nearby and clearly match one
of the answer choices.
In the second example, we are looking for a difference between a white draft and red giant. We see the
question says “suggests,” so this 1s an inference question; the answer will not be as clearly stated in the
passage. To find the evidence, we need to look for “white draft” and “red giant” in the passage and then look
for a difference.

Practice: Underline the keyword(s) in the question below.

Primary and Secondary Keywords
After we identify the keywords, we want to identify the primary and secondary keywords. The primary
keywords are the one(s) that are (1) easiest to locate in the passage and (2) more unique to the question.

These are the most important keyword(s) to find when answering the question.
Once you see the primary keyword(s) in the passage, finding the secondary keyword(s) will confirm that
you are in the right area. If you find the secondary keyword(s) right nearby, you are in the right spot in the
passage. If you do not find the secondary keyword(s) nearby, you should keep looking at other parts of the
passage.

Learning how to identify primary and secondary keywords can help you find your Waldo more quickly and
consistently. When we read any question, we want to use the following steps:
1)

Underline the keyword(s) as you read the question.

2)

Identify the primary keyword(s). The primary keyword(s) are the one(s) that will be easiest to

locate in the passage and are more unique to the question.
3)

Look for the primary keyword(s) in the passage. When you are looking for the primary keywords,

you should be skimming the passage and not reading carefully.
4)

Once you find the primary keyword(s), use the 2-sentence rule. Read 2 sentences before and after
and look for the secondary keyword(s).
a.

Ifyou find the secondary keywords, you are very likely in the right part of the passage,
so you are ready to answer the question.

b.

Ifyou do not find the secondary keyword(s), you are not in the right part of the passage
yet. Go back to step 3 and keep skimming for the primary keyword(s) elsewhere in the
passage.

5)

Find the evidence in the passage (the Waldo) and answer the question.

To see how this works, let’s look at the example questions below:
1.

The passage indicates that covering themselves in mud might benefit some mammals by:
A.

controlling their body temperatures.

B.

improving their camouflage.

C.

protecting their skin.

D.

signaling other animals.

Primary Keyword(s): covering themselves in mud

Secondary Keyword(s): benefit, mammals

In this question, “covering themselves in mud,” “benefits,” and “mammals” are the keywords. The primary
keywords to look for are “covering themselves in mud.” This is most likely only discussed once in the passage
and will be easier to locate. Find where the passage discusses animals covering themselves in mud.
Once we find that, look for the secondary keywords “benefit” and “mammals.” If we find anything about
“benefit” or “mammals,” we know that we are in the right part of the passage. Now, look for how covering
mud benefits some mammals and answer the question.
The keywords “benefits” and “mammals” are likely going to appear more commonly throughout the passage,
so it would be harder to find the right part of the passage quickly if you started by skimming for those words
instead of “covering themselves in mud.”

2.

The passage most strongly suggests that the antennas on top of the Willis Tower are notable
because of material’s:
A.

strength.

B.

color.

C.

cost.

D.

cheapness.

Primary Keyword(s): Willis Tower

Secondary Keyword(s): antenna, material

The primary keyword is “Willis Tower’ because it 1s going to be the easiest to find in the passage. Skim for
“Willis Tower.” Once we find “Willis Tower,” look for the secondary keywords “antenna” and “material” If
we find something about the antenna material, we know you are in the right part of the passage. If we do not,
skim for “Willis Tower” again.

Once we know you are in the right part of the passage, looks evidence for why the antennas on the top of the
Willis Tower are notable and answer the question.

Primary Keywords
Below are a3 common types of keywords that you should (almost) always select as a primary keyword.

1)

Capitalized words (Names, locations, etc.)
Names, locations, or any other capitalized words are always good keywords to prioritize, especially
when answering a question without a line reference. Capitalized words are easier to find when
skimming through the passage.

To demonstrate this, let’s consider the example below:
1.

Based on the passage, regarding his business, King Curtis’ attitude can be best
described as:
A.

resentful.

B.

patient.

C.

involved.

D.

protective.

Primary Keyword(s): King Curtis

Secondary Keyword(s): business, attitude
The name “King Curtis” will be easy to find when skimming the passage. Once we find “King Curtis,”

then use the 2-sentence rules and look for any statements about the business and his attitude.
Even if “King Curtis” appears multiple times in the passage, using the name as a primary keyword will
still likely be much faster to find that looking for “business” or “attitude,” which will be harder to locate.

This is why we should always make capitalized words a primary keyword.

2)

Numbers
Numbers are always a primary keyword. Just like capitalized words, numbers are always easy to find
in the passage, making them great keywords for any question without a line refence.
To demonstrate this, let’s consider the example below:
2.

According to the passage, which group recycled the most aluminum cans in the 1980s?
A.

The Salvation Army.

B.

The Pacific Northwest.

C.

Private aluminum companies.

D.

Public recycling collection programs.

Primary Keyword(s): 1980s

Secondary Keyword(s): aluminum cans, recycled
Skimming for “1980s” in the passage should be the easiest keyword to find. Once we find “1980s” (or a
specific year in the 1980s), look for “aluminum cans.” After we find “1980s” and “aluminum cans,”
look for anything about which group recycled the most aluminum cans.

3)

Unique Keyword(s)
Look for unique keyword(s) in the question that are not consistently used in the passage. Once

you find the unique keyword(s) in the passage, read for context. The evidence is usually within a few
sentences of the unique keyword(s).
As an example, let’s consider the question below:

3.

According to the passage, heliocentrism is a theory about the solar system that:

GaAWpY

was first proposed by the Ancient Greeks.
supports Kepler’s observations.

was conclusively proven by Copernicus in the 16" Century.
proposes the sun is the center point of the entire solar system.

Primary Keyword(s): heliocentrism

Secondary Keyword(s): none
In this question, the primary (and only) keyword is “heliocentrism. This question is somewhat vague,
So it is a good example of a question where we should read the answer choices more quickly. We
will discuss this skill more later in this course.
Skim for “heliocentrism” in the passage. Once you find it, use the 2-sentence rule and, if you have not

already done so, read the answer choices.

Look for evidence in the passage that matches one of the

statements in the answer choices.

TIP — Look for Synonyms of Keywords
The exact keywords from the question are not always in the passage, so you should also look for synonyms
of the primary and secondary keywords. For most questions, the exact keywords from the question will
be in the passage, but that is not always the case. For example, if a question asks:
1.

The passage suggests that the narrator’s relationship with her family is:
A.

strained and not a factor in her decision to move back to New York.

B.

distant but one that she hopes to improve in the future.

C.

reserved but fulfilling.

D.

loving despite the challenging of living apart.

Primary Keyword: family
Synonyms: mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter, siblings, cousin, etc.

When we go back to the passage, you cannot just look for the word “family.” Any of the synonyms above
also refer to the narrator’s family, so we should look for the word “family” along with any of the synonyms
above. It is possible that the word “family” never appear in the passage. But if we find a statement about
the narrator’s siblings, we find the evidence that tells us about the narrator’s relationship with her family.
2.

Inthe passage, the narrator is uneasy about:

A.

the meeting next week with the publisher.

B.

finishing his book by the deadline.

C.

how his father may respond to the book’s title.

D.

how the book will be reviewed by the Washington Post.

Primary Keyword: uneasy
Synonyms: anxious, worry, concern, etc.

When we go to the passage, we cannot just look for the word “uneasy” but also need to look for any
synonyms as well. It is possible the word “uneasy” never appears in the passage. As you skim the passage,
look for anything showing the author is feeling uneasy.

Skill #3 — Rephrase the Question in Your Own Words (If Necessary)
For many questions on the ACT, the keyword(s) are enough to know exactly what you are looking for. For
these questions, there is no need to rephrase the question in your own words. For example, let’s say a question
asks:
1.

According to the passage, the Egyptians invented addition at the same time as:
A.

the Mayans invented zero.

B.

the Babylonians invented addition.

C.

the Europeans invented numbers.

D.

the Minoans set sail on their first ships.

For this question, the question itself makes it very clear what you are looking for. Skim for “Egyptians
inventing addition,” find the date, and then see which of the answer choices is at the same time.
For shorter/simpler questions like the example above, there is no need to rephrase the question in your
own words.

When to Rephrase the Question In Your Own Words
For more complicated questions that are a bit more challenging to break down, it can be important to rephrase
the questions in your own words. If you can rephrase the question in your own words, you know exactly
what you are looking for when you go back to the passage. To show you when and how to do this, let’s
look at the following questions:
1.

The narrator indicates that which of the following potential risks that doctors face while at work is

a concern to her father?
A.

Diseases that result from long-term exposure to radiation.

B.

Loss of practice income because of a disability.

C.

Exposure to an uncurable illness.

D.

Accidents due to limited sleep and high stress.

Rephrase: What risk that doctors face is a concern for her father?

With this question, there is not a clear primary keyword(s) that we can easily skim for in the passage. Instead,
it is important to be clear on exactly what you are looking for. The best primary keyword here is probably
“father.” However, if you just go skim for “father” in the passage and are not clear that you are looking for
“risks that doctors face that concern her father,” you are likely going to have much more trouble finding the
right part of the passage.

Now, let’s look at a second example question:
2.

Inthe passage, it can most reasonably be inferred that Austin’s teammates liked playing with him in
part because, in contrast with other teammates, Austin:
A.

understands each teammates’ individual strengths.

B.

allows his teammates to showcase their talents during games.

C.

played professionally for five years.

D._

is familiar with a variety of strategies and set plays.

Rephrase: Why do Austin’s teammates like playing with him?
The primary keyword here is “Austin.” But what if Austin appears a lot in the passage? Or the entire passage

is about Austin? The only other keyword you can look for is “teammates.” If you look for “teammates” and
are not clear on what you are looking for specifically, finding the Waldo is going to be very difficult and time
consuming.
Rephrasing the question makes it easier to know exactly what you are looking. You need to find why Austin’s
teammates like playing with him. Keeping this in the front of your mind as you skim the passage for “Austin”

and “teammates” will make it much easier for you to know when you have found the correct part of the
passage.

Tips For When to Rephrase the Question in Your Own Words
1.

Ifyou read a question and are unclear exactly what the question is asking, rephrase the question
in your own words before going back to the passage.

2.

For long questions with many keywords, rephrase the question. This will help you frame what
you are looking for and prioritize what keyword(s) are the most important to find in the passage.

3.

Generally speaking, the longer the questions is, the more likely you should rephrase the question
in your own words.

4,

Find what works for you! There is no set of rules for when to rephrase the question vs. when to use

the keywords. Practice and find what works for you.

Now that we have learned the basics, let’s try to work on rephrasing with some more examples. For each
example below, (1) identify the question type, (2) identify the primary and secondary keyword(s),
and (3) rephrase the question in your own words if necessary. If you do not need to rephrase the

question, leave the spot blank. In addition, think about what approach you would use for the question
and what type of evidence you would look for. You can refer to the list of question types on page 29.
