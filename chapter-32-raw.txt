Chapter 32: Vectors
A vector is a quantity that has both a magnitude (length) and direction. Vectors commonly are used to
show motion, such as velocity and acceleration. Since vectors are not commonly taught in math class, many
students are stumped when vectors appear on the ACT. In this chapter, we will teach you everything you need
to know for vectors on the ACT!

G) What is a Vector?
A vector shows the magnitude and direction of a motion. Vectors are drawn as arrows on the coordinate plane.
For example, if a car is driving at 30° east of north at 10 miles per hour, the vector would be:
_10

oh 307

hh
| -10

The magnitude (length) of the vector is 10, which shows the speed that the car is traveling. If the car was
driving at 20mph, the magnitude (length) of the vector would be 20. The direction is shown by the direction of

the vector, which is pointing 30° east of north.
Vectors on the ACT are most commonly written in the following forms:
Standard form:

v = Ai+ Bj

Component Form:

v = (A,B)

In standard form, Ai shows the x-component of the vector and Bj shows the y-component of the vector. In
simpler terms, the A shows how far the vector goes left or nght and the B shows how far the vector goes up or
down. In component form, the A shows the x-component and the B shows the y-component.
The easiest way to teach this is with some examples. Let’s consider vectors X and Y below:

When starting at the origin, a vector written in Ai + Bj or (A, B) notation ends at point (A, B). For
vector X, we see the vector goes 3 units to the right and 4 units up and ends at the point (4,3). For vector Y,
we see the vector goes 4 units to the left and 2 units down and ends at the point (—4, —2).

Vector Addition and Subtraction
The most common vectors question on the ACT is vector addition and subtraction. The good news 1s that
vector addition and subtraction is simple! When given multiple vectors, all we do is combine like terms.

Example 1: What is the sum of vectors (2,5) and (—6, 8) ?
A. (8,13)

B. (—4,13)

C. (-8, —3)

G)

D. (—4, 3)

Solution: To add vectors in component form, we combine like terms, so we add the A values, the
x-components, and B values, the y-components, together.
For the A values, we get: 2 + (—6) = —4
For the B values, we get.

5+ 8 = 13

Combining our answers, we get (—4, 13). The answer is B.
It’s simple arithmetic! The only way the ACT can make these questions slightly more difficult 1s by adding a
coefficient, as shown in Example 2.
Example 2: The vectors A and B can be written as 5i — j and 12i — 4j respectively. If vector C is equal
to 2A — B, which of the following represents vector C ?
A. 22i—6j

B. 10i-—2j

C. -2i+2j

D. 2i-—6j

Solution: When there is a coefficient in front of a vector, such as the 2 in 2A, we distribute the coefficient into
in the vector.

2A = 2(5i — J) = 10% — 2j
Now that we know 2A, we can subtract B from 2A to find vector C:

C = 2A—B = (10i — 2f) — (12i — 4)
To solve, we distribute the negative sign and combine like terms.
C= 10i —-2j—121+4j= —2i+ 2j
The answer is C.

Vector Addition and Subtraction On A Graph
For more advanced vectors questions, you need to know how to draw vector addition and subtraction on

a graph using the tip-to-tail method. When adding or subtracting vectors, we will use the following steps:
1.

Start at the origin and draw the Ist vector. For example, if we have 3 vectors A, B, and C and are
solving for A + B + C, we first draw vector A. The point where the first vector ends, where the top of
the arrow is located, is called the tip. This will be our new starting point for drawing the next vector
in the equation.

2.

For the 2nd vector, start at the tip of the 1st vector and draw the 2nd vector. The tail of the
second vector (the straight part of the arrow) starts at the tip of the first arrow, hence the name
tip-to-tail. For our example, we draw vector B and start from the tip of vector A.

3.

Repeat this process for any additional vectors. For our example, we have so far done A + B. We
still need to add vector C, so we start at the tail of vector B and draw vector C.

4.

Draw a vector from the origin to the tip of the final vector in the equation. This vector

represents the final vector that you solved for. For our example, we draw a vector from the origin
to the tip of vector C. The vector that we draw is the vector for A

We can see that vector A + B — C goes 2 unit left and 4 units up, which is the same as vector D in the original
figure. The correct answer is A. This tip-to-tail method takes some practice, so be sure to work through the
practice questions to increase your confidence if you have never used this method before.

Magnitude of a Vector
The magnitude of a vector is the length of the vector. Magnitude most commonly comes up on the ACT with
questions involving velocity. For example, if a ball is traveling at 40 feet per second, the vector showing this
motion would have a magnitude of 40.
The magnitude of a vector can be found using the following equation:

For vector Ai + Bj or (A,B), magnitude = , A? + B?
The magnitude of a vector is rarely tested on the ACT, but you should memorize the equation above just in
case. The equation above is the same as the Pythagorean theorem. If you forget the equation on test day, you
can draw the vector on the coordinate plane, make a triangle, and use the Pythagorean theorem to solve.
