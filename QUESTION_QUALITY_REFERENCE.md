# ACT Math Practice Questions - Quality Reference Document

## Critical Quality Standards

### 1. Question Structure Requirements
- **50 questions per lesson** - NO EXCEPTIONS
- **Difficulty progression**:
  - Questions 1-17: EASY (fundamental concepts, straightforward calculations)
  - Questions 18-34: MEDIUM (multi-step problems, combined concepts)
  - Questions 35-50: HARD (complex problems, ACT-level challenge)

### 2. Problem Text Format
- Use proper math notation:
  - Fractions: `3/4` or `1/2`
  - Exponents: `x^2` or `2^3`
  - Square roots: `√(16)` or `sqrt(25)`
  - Mixed numbers: `3 1/2`
  - Multiplication: Use `×` or `*`
  - Division: Use `÷` or `/`
- Questions should be on the LEFT side when rendered
- Answer choices appear on the RIGHT side with question number

### 3. Answer Choice Requirements (CRITICAL)
- Exactly 4 choices: A, B, C, D
- Each choice MUST have:
  - `letter`: "A", "B", "C", or "D"
  - `text`: The answer value
  - `explanation`: Detailed explanation (see below)

### 4. Explanation Quality Standards (MOST IMPORTANT)

#### For CORRECT answers:
- Start with "CORRECT."
- Provide complete step-by-step solution
- Show all work and reasoning
- Verify the answer
- Example: "CORRECT. Following PEMDAS, multiply first: 3 × 4 = 12, then add: 5 + 12 = 17."

#### For INCORRECT answers:
- Identify the SPECIFIC misconception or error
- Explain WHY this error leads to this answer
- Reference the correct concept they should use
- Be educational, not just dismissive
- Example: "This incorrectly adds first: (5 + 3) × 2 = 16. You must follow PEMDAS order of operations, which requires multiplication before addition."

### 5. Common Student Errors to Address
Each question should have wrong answers that target common mistakes:
- **Order of operations errors**: Adding before multiplying, etc.
- **Sign errors**: Negative × negative, subtracting negatives
- **Distribution errors**: Forgetting to distribute to all terms
- **Like terms errors**: Combining unlike terms, wrong coefficients
- **Arithmetic errors**: Simple calculation mistakes
- **Conceptual misunderstandings**: Fundamental concept confusion

### 6. Answer Correctness Verification
**BEFORE finalizing each question:**
1. ✓ Solve the problem independently
2. ✓ Verify the correct answer is actually correct
3. ✓ Check each wrong answer makes sense as a plausible error
4. ✓ Ensure all explanations are accurate
5. ✓ Confirm math notation is consistent

### 7. Content Alignment with Lessons
**Each question MUST:**
- Directly test concepts from the specific lesson
- Match the lesson's topic and scope
- Use terminology from the lesson
- Progress in difficulty appropriately
