    title: "Talking Scop",
    introduction: "Essay about the Anglo-Saxon oral tradition and the scop (storyteller)",
    passage_text: `Hwet! This Old English term meaning "Hark!" or "Listen!" is perhaps best known as the first word in the medieval epic poem Beowulf. The word hints at the importance of oral tradition hundreds of years ago in Anglo-Saxon England. Between the fifth and twelfth centuries, this tradition was upheld by scops, professional poets who sang or recited poetry at ceremonies.

In the Middle Ages, however, the ability to write wasn't common, even among royalty. Narratives such as the heroic epic Beowulf and the mournful poem The Seafarer have been passed on through spoken word for centuries. The position of scop required not only great memorization skills but also the ability to compose epic works on a regular basis. Scops became the keepers of poems, songs, and even the histories of their people.

Skilled scops were valued so highly in Anglo-Saxon society that they were sometimes granted extra rewards for their talents. In fact, there are several records of royals giving land to deserving scops. Coins or gold rings‚Äîwhich could be used as status symbols to display one's success‚Äîwere common gifts for scops who did well.

To achieve this kind of success, a scop needed to transcend being just an entertainer in a mead hall. While mindful of the expectation that they would glorify their leaders, scops set standards for morality through their celebration of heroes and condemnation of villains. A scop was also a moral compass for the community. Therefore, a person's reputation could rise or fall by the scop's hand. Additionally, scops preserved and conveyed through history from one generation to the next, providing a type of immortality traditionally revered by the Anglo-Saxons. More than a storyteller, the scop was a historian, teacher, and messenger of community values. The scop's call of "Hwet!" was an invitation to audiences to gather and celebrate their culture.`

    title: "Logging the Lake",
    introduction: "Personal narrative about a summer job helping with lake logging in Maine",
    passage_text: `Last June while I was visiting family in Maine, my uncle Lee invited me, a total city girl, to his "summer office"‚Äîa nickname for his boat. He's a teacher, but in the summer he salvages sunken logs from lakes and sells them. So one morning as we walked to the dock to ready the pontoon, a versatile type of boat that's essentially a platform atop two hollow metal flotation cylinders. After a chilly ride across Moosehead Lake, we reached a bay that Uncle Lee had tagged on his GPS. He activated the boat's sonar and piloted slowly forward as we watched a monitor. Soon, ghostly images appeared on the screen, showing what looked like a jumble of matchsticks on the lake bottom. They weren't matchsticks, of course, but sunken logs.

For centuries, Maine loggers sent their harvests to market by floating them down rivers. When the logs reached Moosehead Lake, they were bound together and towed to lakeside sawmills. Each year, some of the logs sank. In the deep water, protected from insects and oxygen, the wood remained well preserved.

On the boat, another monitor displayed the underwater video camera's view of the grapple arm reaching for a log that Uncle Lee thought was birch. The arm's iron pinchers grasped the log, coaxed it from beneath another log, and, aided by a winch, pulled it from the depths. When the log surfaced, it looked like a slimy, hefty telephone pole. As my uncle lashed the log to the boat, he pointed out the axe marks on the wood. Because it was felled by an axe, he explained, the tree was probably cut in the mid-nineteenth century. Add to that the age of the tree‚Äîeasily two hundred years‚Äîand we were looking at a birch may have started life a century before the Declaration of Independence.

By the end of the day, I'd gotten pretty good at operating the grapple arm, and we had nine logs tied to the boat. Uncle Lee said that one day last year he hauled out twenty logs, but some days he'd leave the lake without finding a single salvageable log. Our load of high-quality wood would become beautiful furniture or flooring, complete with an immersing backstory.`

    title: "The Meteoric Rise of Meenakshi Wadhwa",
    introduction: "Profile of planetary scientist Meenakshi Wadhwa and her work with meteorites",
    passage_text: `Meenakshi Wadhwa was pursuing her PhD when a professor asked her if she wanted to see a meteorite from Mars. Wadhwa was struck by how similar the rock's chemical makeup was to that of Earth rocks. Since then, the idea that she could learn about the composition of distant worlds by studying meteorites has driven Wadhwa's career ever since.

After graduating, Wadhwa became the curator of the meteorite collection at The Field Museum in Chicago, where she conducted research on meteorites, especially those from Mars. Wadhwa used a mass spectrometer to identify and measure the elements in meteorite samples. The mass spectrometer revealed the rocks' age and hinted at the processes that created them. This information helped Wadhwa better understand the geological history of Mars.

In 2006, Wadhwa became the director of the Center for Meteorite Studies at Arizona State University. With more than 1,800 space rocks, including samples from Mars and the asteroid belt. The meteorite collection Wadhwa oversees is the largest at any university. Because meteorites contain material that predates Earth, Wadhwa and her colleagues can learn about the elements that were present when the Sun, planets, and moons formed.

Wadhwa's research has shed light on the early history of the solar system. For example, a 2010 study she cowrote found that the solar system is likely 1.9 million years older than the previous estimate. In 2013, Wadhwa and two colleagues discovered evidence that a supernova that exploded before the planets formed likely seeded our solar system with many essential elements.

Of the many honors Wadhwa's research has earned her, perhaps the most meaningful one came from astronomers Carolyn and Gene Shoemaker. After discovering an asteroid, they asked the International Astronomical Union to name it after Wadhwa. The asteroid's orbit crosses that of the Red Planet, meaning that one day, as Wadhwa put it, she "just might have an impact on Mars."`

    title: "The Soul of Stax",
    introduction: "Essay about Stax Records and its influence on 1960s soul music",
    passage_text: `Stax Records of Memphis, Tennessee, may be less renowned than Detroit's Motown, but its contributions to 1960s American soul music were no less significant. Stax, which had a grittier, funkier sound than Motown's, blending elements of country, gospel, and rhythm & blues. But beyond genre, it was the people, their methods, and even the building itself (which had once been a movie theater) that made Stax one of the most exceptional recording studios of the era.

Stax's unlikely founders, siblings Jim Stewart and Estelle Axton, were bankers who loved music. They knew little about the music industry or soul, but they had open minds and encouraged collaboration. Their open-door policy allowed unestablished or unconventional artists to make their names at Stax. Booker T. Jones, Carla Thomas, and Otis Redding were just a few of more than thirty artists all became a part of the musical "conversation" happening there.

That conversation included a range of perspectives rarely found at other studios. Despite the pervasive segregation of Memphis in the 1960s, the Stax staff and house band were fully integrated. The "Stax family" also included people of various ages and economic backgrounds, all contributed to Stax's unique sound.

Another distinction was one of method. At most studios, performers worked from previously arranged sheet music. In contrast, Stax musicians spontaneously composed music together, a practice called head arranging. Otis Redding might walk in and sing a few lyrics to the band. The other musicians would riff on his idea until a complete song emerged from the collaboration. Then, they'd record the song without ever putting the notes on paper.

Even the building helped to create the Stax sound. Recording equipment in the 1960s was rudimentary by today's standards. But the former theater's sloped floor and bass-heavy movie speakers gave recordings a deep, raw tone so distinctive that aficionados can often recognize a Stax song within the first few notes.`
