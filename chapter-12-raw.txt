Chapter 12: Mean, Median, Mode, and Range
To start, let’s review the basic definitions of mean, median, mode, and range:
Mean (average): The sum divided by the number of items.
Median: The middle number in a list of numbers when ordered from smallest to largest.

Mode: The number that appears most often.
Range: The difference between the smallest and the largest numbers.

The ACT most commonly tests you on the mean, so you need know how to solve various types of mean
(average) questions. For these questions, remember that:

Number of Items

Example 1: The five students who sit in the front row of Ms. Rashard’s class averaged 24 points on last

Friday’s quiz. If the first four students received scores of 22, 28, 17, and 25, what was the score of the
fifth student?
A.

24

B. 26

C. 28

D. 29

Solution: Let’s call the fifth student’s score x and set up the question using the average equation.
24 - eee

24. _ 92+%x

120 = 92 +x
x= 28
The answer is C.

Example 2: The AP Biology final is out of 100 points. The first period class of 6 students gets an average

score of 85. The second period class of 9 students gets an average score of 90. What is the average score
for all the students combined?
A.

86

B. 87

C. 88

D. 89

Solution: To solve this question, we need to find out the total number of points scored by all students
from both classes and then divide by the total number of students (15).
In the equations below, x represents the sum of the test scores for all 6 students in the 1st period class
and y represents the sum of the test scores for all 9 students in the 2nd period class. To start, we can
find the total number of points the 6 students in the Ist period class received.

85 =~
6

x=510

The first period students received a total of

510 points. Even though we do not know the individual scores of

each student’s tests, we know the total. We can repeat this same calculation for the 2nd period class.

90 =2
9

y = 810

Chapter 12: Mean, Median, Mode, and Range

Notice that to find the total points for each class, we multiplied the class average by the number of students. In
general terms, we multiply the average by the number of items to find the sum. This is commonly the
first step in many average questions, so make sure that you remember this simple step to find the sum
whenever you are given an average.

Now, we can solve for the average score for all students combined.

The answer is C.

Example 3: Erica’s golden retriever gave birth twice in the last two years. Her first litter had 7 puppies

with an average weight of p lbs. Her second litter had 5 puppies with an average weight of m pounds.
Which of the following expressions correctly calculates the average weight w, in pounds, of all of the
puppies that Erica’s golden retriever gave birth to over the last two years?

A.

_ ptm

w=—
12

7p+5m

Bow=l+

C. w= ——
12

D. w

__ 7m+5p
12

Solution: Method 1 — “Math Teacher Way”: To find the average puppy weight, we need to find the total
weight of all the puppies and divide it by the total number of puppies. First, we can find the total weight of her
first litter:
sum

7

7p = total weight of puppies in 1st litter

We can repeat this to find the total weight of the second litter:
sum

5

5m = total weight of puppies in 2nd litter

We know that there are 12 puppies total, so now we can calculate the average weight.
_ 7p+5m

42

The answer is C.

Method 2 — Pick Numbers. For many students, this question is difficult because we are not given any values
for the average weights of the litters. To make this question easier, we can use substitution and pick numbers.
Let’s say the first litter has an average weight of 1 pound (p = 1) and the second litter has an average weight

of 3 pounds (m = 3). We can use our numbers to solve for the average weight of the puppies in both litters.
Total Weight of 1st Litter = 7 x 1=7

The first litter had 7 puppies with an average weight of 1 pound, so the total weight of the litter is 7 pounds.
Total Weight of 2nd Litter

=5 x 3 = 15

The second litter had 5 puppies with an average weight of 3 pounds, so the total weight is 15 pounds. Now,
we can find the average weight of each puppy from these two litters.

With our values of p = 1 and m = 3, we found that w = = To find the correct answer choice, plug in our

values of p = 1 and m = 3 to the answer choices and see which one gives you w = =: Below, you can see
how the correct answer choice C gives us the correct value for w.

Example 4: During the first 30 minutes of work at Birkee’s Bakery, Vaivani decorated 23 cookies per
minute for the first 10 minutes and then at 14 cookies per minute for the next 20 minutes. Which of the

following gives the average number of cookies that Vaivani decorated per minute for her first 30 minutes

at work?
A.

15

B.

16

C.

16.5

D.

17

Solution: In this question, we are given two averages that do not equally affect the final result. Since the first
average of 23 cookies per minute is for 10 minutes and the second average of 14 cookies per minute is for 20
minutes, these averages cannot be treated equally. In math, this is called a weighted average. To solve
weighted average questions with two items, we can use the equation below:
Weighted Average =

(average #1)(weight #1) + (average #2)(weight #2)
weight #1 + weight #2

In this equation, the two averages are the given averages, so we plug in 23 for average #1 and 14 for average
#2. The weight refers to the significance of the data point. Exactly what the weight is will depend on the
question. For Example 4, the weight is the number of minutes, with 10 being weight #1 and 20 being weight
#2. If there was a question where we were trying to calculate your final grade and 70% of your grade was
from homework and 30% was from tests, the percentages of 70 and 30 would be the weights. The weights are

used to reflect that certain averages have more “weight,” or more significance, than others.
Now, let’s get back to Example 4 and use the weighted average formula to solve:
Average Number of Cookies =

(23)(10)+(14)(20) __

10+20

7

17

The answer is D.

The weighted average formula is a very important one and can be used to solve many ACT average questions.
Looking back to Example 2, we can use a weighted average to solve. In that question, the averages are given
as 85 for the first class and 90 for the second class. The weight is the number of students in each class, which
is 6 and 9.
Average Score =

(85)(6)+(90)(9) _ 38
6+9

We even could use the weighted average formula for Example 3. The averages are given to be p and m. The
weight is the number of puppies in each litter, which is 7 and 5.
(p)(7)+(m) (5) _ 7p+5m

Average Puppy Weight =

74+5

12

Make sure that you understand how the weighted average formula works. As you can see, knowing how to
properly find a weighted average can allow you to solve many difficult-looking average questions in one quick
Step.

Example 5: Patricia’s average score on her first 4 chemistry tests is 88. How many points higher than
her current average score must Patricia score on her 5th test for her new average on all 5 tests to increase
by 2 points?
A.

10

B. 8

C. 6

D. 5

Solution: Patricia’s new average score will be 90. Since we know Patricia’s current average is 88, we can
find the total number of points Patricia must have scored on her first 4 tests.
__ total points on 4 tests

88
=

4

total points on 4 tests = 352

Since we know the final average must be 90, we can now solve for the 5" test score, x.

- 104
-

Chapter 12: Mean, Median, Mode, and Range

90

_ 3524+x

an:

x = 98

Patricia’s 5" test score is 98, which is 10 points higher than the original average of 88. The answer is A.
Mathematically, this works because the additional 10 points above the average are equally divided over 5 tests,

so the overall score will increase by =, or 2 points. If that shortcut method is confusing to you, just stick with
the normal method we used to solve questions like this.

Example 6: The mean household income in a neighborhood with 80 residents is $90,250 per year. Ifa
new family moves in with a household income of $1,859,000, which of the following values for the

neighborhood will most likely change the least?
A. Mean

B. Median

C. Maximum

D. Range

Solution: The new family has a much higher household income than the mean household income for the rest
of the neighborhood. In statistics, we call values that are far higher or lower than any other numbers in the
data set outliers. Any outlier will greatly increase the range and maximum value. The new family’s
income is also so large that it will increase the mean household income for the neighborhood.
The median will change the least. Since the median is the middle value in a data set, any outliers always
have a minimal effect on the median. The answer is B.

Example 7: For her science fair experiment, Monica wanted to find out if her tree frog or bullfrog has the

bigger jump. She placed each frog on a starting spot and then measured how far the frogs jumped, in
inches. The results for each frog, in inches, are below:
Tree Frog: 41, 18, 30, 8, 14, 33

Bullfrog: 38, 19, 66, 48, 45, 33, 10
Iffis the median jump length for the tree frog and / is the median jump length for the bullfrog, what is the

value of h — f?
A.

14

B. 20

C. 24

D. 29

Solution: To start, we need to reorder the numbers in each data from smallest to largest.
Tree Frog: 8, 14, 18, 30, 33, 41

Bullfrog:

10, 19, 33, 38, 45, 48, 66

Next, we cross out numbers from both sides to find the median. For data sets with an odd number of numbers,
such as the bullfrog data in this question, the median is just the middle value. For data sets with an even
number of numbers, such as the tree frog data in this question, you need to take the average of the two middle
numbers to find the median.
Tree Frog: 8, +4, 18, 30, 33, 44

Bullfrog: +0, 49, 33, 38, 45, 48, 66

Tree Frog median = f = — = 24

Bullfrog median = h = 38

h—f =38-24=14
The answer is A.

Finding the Median in a Table
The ACT also sometimes asks you to find the median value in a frequency table. For these questions, we will
need to use a more efficient method than listing all the values and crossing off to find the median value.
Example 8: The school newspaper recently surveyed 51 students about their monthly consumption of
cheeseburgers. The results of the survey are summarized in the table below. What was the median
number of cheeseburgers eaten each month by the students in the survey?

A. 0

B.

1

Number of Burgers Eaten

Number of Students

0

7

1

19

2-3

8

4-5

13

6+

4

C. 2-3

D. 4-5

Solution: The trick to solving these questions is to identify what term the median in the data set is. To
find the median term, there are three quick steps:
1.

Add 1 to the total number of items in the data set.

2.

Divide that number by 2.

e

If we have a data set with an odd number of items, the number we get is the term that is
the median.

e

If we have a data set with an even number of items, we will get an answer that ends in 0.5.
In this case, the median is the average of the two middle terms. The two middle terms are
the integers right above and below the value that we get from our first two steps. For
example, if we have a group of 20, we would get 10.5 in step 2. This tell us that two
middle terms will be the 10th and 11th terms. We find the median by finding the average
of the 10th and 11th terms.

3.

Find where the term is in the table.

In this question, we have 51 students who were surveyed, so following Step 1 above
51+1
2

= 26

we find the 26th student will be the median data point in the set. To find where the 26th student is in the
table, start at the top of the table and simply add up the students until you find the 26th student. Here,
there are 7 students who ate 0 burgers and 19 who ate 1 burger. If we add 7 and 19 together, we get 26,
so we can tell that the 26th student ate 1 burger. As a result, the median is 1 and the answer is B.
