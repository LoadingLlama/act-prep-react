====================================================================================================
SCIENTIFIC ACCURACY RULES:
====================================================================================================

When creating science passages, ensure:

1. REALISTIC VALUE RANGES:
   - Temperature: 0-100°C for most experiments
   - pH: 0-14 (acids: 0-7, bases: 7-14)
   - Percentages: 0-100%
   - Time: Use realistic units (seconds, minutes, hours, days)

2. LOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS:
   - If temperature increases, some property should change
   - Tables should show clear trends (increasing, decreasing, or constant)
   - Data points should be consistent with scientific laws

3. REALISTIC PRECISION:
   - Temperature: 1-2 decimal places (25.5°C)
   - pH: 1 decimal place (pH 7.2)
   - Percentages: 0-1 decimal places (35% or 35.5%)

4. PLAUSIBILITY CHECKS:
   - Water boils at 100°C (not 150°C)
   - pH 7 is neutral (not acidic)
   - Photosynthesis requires light (not darkness)
   - Reactions speeds up with temperature (usually)
