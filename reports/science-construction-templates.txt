SCIENCE EXPERIMENT DESIGN TEMPLATES - Step-by-Step Construction
====================================================================================================

CRITICAL: I need the CONSTRUCTION PROCESS, not just examples.

====================================================================================================
TEMPLATE 1: DATA REPRESENTATION (3 passages, 5 questions each)
====================================================================================================

PURPOSE: Present experimental data in tables/graphs for interpretation

CONSTRUCTION STEPS:

STEP 1: Choose experimental setup
  Variables to test:
    - Temperature vs. some property
    - pH vs. some property
    - Concentration vs. some property
    - Time vs. some property
    - Distance/depth vs. some property

EXAMPLE from actual test:
  Title: "13-Lined Ground Squirrel Hibernation"
  Words: 162
  Preview: When a 13-lined ground squirrel (a mammal) hibernates, it does not eat, and it alternates between periods of torpor (characterized by a reduced rate of metabolism, low body temperature, and little mov...

STEP 2: Create data table
  Structure:
    - 2-3 columns (independent variable + 1-2 dependent variables)
    - 3-5 rows of data
    - Show clear trend (increase, decrease, or plateau)
    - Use realistic values (from extracted ranges)

STEP 3: Write description (80-150 words)
  Include:
    - What was measured
    - How it was measured
    - Results summary (reference table)
  Format: 2-3 short paragraphs

STEP 4: Create 5 questions
  Q1: Direct data reading ("According to Table X, when Y=Z, what is...")
  Q2: Trend identification ("As X increases, Y...")
  Q3: Comparison ("Which has higher/lower...")
  Q4: Extrapolation ("If trend continues, at X=W, Y would be...")
  Q5: Interpretation ("Data suggests that...")

DATA RANGES (use realistic values):
  - Temperature: 0-100Â°C
  - pH: 3-11
  - Percentages: 0-100%
  - Concentration: 0.1-5.0 M
  - Time: 0-120 minutes or 0-24 hours


====================================================================================================
TEMPLATE 2: RESEARCH SUMMARY (2 passages, 6-7 questions each)
====================================================================================================

PURPOSE: Describe experimental procedure and results

CONSTRUCTION STEPS:

STEP 1: Design experiment
  Components:
    - Hypothesis or research question
    - Materials needed
    - Procedure (2-3 steps)
    - Results (data or observations)

EXAMPLE from actual test:
  Title: "Flies as Bacterial Vectors"
  Words: 264
  Preview: Scientists conducted 3 experiments to study the transfer of bacteria from one surface to another by 2 species of flies: Musca domestica and Sarcophaga carnaria.  **Experiment 1** A group of 10 M. dome...

STEP 2: Write experimental description (200-350 words)
  Structure:
    - Paragraph 1: Background and purpose
    - Paragraph 2: Procedure and methods
    - Paragraph 3: Results (reference tables/figures)
    - Paragraph 4: Additional observations (optional)

STEP 3: Create 2 experiments (Experiment 1 and Experiment 2)
  Relationship:
    - Test same concept with different variable
    - Or test at different conditions
    - Results should be related/comparable

STEP 4: Create 6-7 questions
  Q1-2: Procedure understanding ("In Experiment 1, what was measured?")
  Q3-4: Data interpretation ("Results of Experiment 2 show that...")
  Q5-6: Comparison ("Experiments 1 and 2 differ in...")
  Q7: Application ("To test [new hypothesis], scientists should...")


====================================================================================================
TEMPLATE 3: CONFLICTING VIEWPOINTS (1 passage, 11-13 questions)
====================================================================================================

PURPOSE: Present 2-3 competing scientific explanations

CONSTRUCTION STEPS:

STEP 1: Choose controversial topic
  Examples:
    - Formation of geological feature
    - Cause of observed phenomenon
    - Mechanism of biological process
    - Classification of organism/object

EXAMPLE from actual test:
  Title: "Exothermic Reaction Study"
  Words: 108
  Preview: Chemical reactions that release heat are exothermic reactions. The amount of heat released depends on the number of moles of reactants consumed. When sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) and sodium iodide (NaI...

STEP 2: Write introduction (50-100 words)
  Content:
    - Background information
    - Describe phenomenon to be explained
    - State that scientists disagree

STEP 3: Write Hypothesis 1 (100-150 words)
  Structure:
    - State the hypothesis clearly
    - Provide 2-3 supporting arguments
    - Reference specific evidence

STEP 4: Write Hypothesis 2 (100-150 words)
  Structure:
    - State alternative hypothesis
    - Provide different supporting arguments
    - Must contradict Hypothesis 1 on key point

STEP 5: (Optional) Write Hypothesis 3 (100-150 words)
  Structure:
    - Third alternative explanation
    - Distinct from both H1 and H2

STEP 6: Create 11-13 questions
  Q1-4: Understanding each hypothesis ("According to Hypothesis 1...")
  Q5-7: Comparing hypotheses ("H1 and H2 differ in their explanation of...")
  Q8-10: Evidence evaluation ("Which finding supports H1?")
  Q11-13: Application ("If [new data], which hypothesis is supported?")


====================================================================================================
UNIVERSAL SCIENCE PASSAGE RULES:
====================================================================================================

1. SCIENTIFIC ACCURACY:
   - All data must be physically/chemically possible
   - Trends must be realistic
   - Use correct scientific terminology

2. CLARITY:
   - Define all variables
   - Label all tables/figures
   - Use consistent units

3. APPROPRIATE COMPLEXITY:
   - High school level science
   - No advanced college concepts
   - Focus on data interpretation, not memorization
