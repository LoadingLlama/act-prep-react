====================================================================================================
UNIVERSAL MATH DISTRACTOR STRATEGIES:
====================================================================================================

1. SIGN ERROR:
   If correct answer is negative, offer positive version
   If answer is +5, distractor is -5

2. CALCULATION ERROR:
   Off by one: If answer is 12, distractor is 11 or 13
   Doubled: If answer is 8, distractor is 16
   Halved: If answer is 20, distractor is 10

3. PARTIAL SOLUTION:
   Stop before final step
   Example: Find perimeter but give area instead

4. CONCEPTUAL ERROR:
   Use wrong formula
   Example: Use diameter instead of radius in circle formula

5. UNIT ERROR:
   Give answer in wrong units
   Example: Answer should be meters but give centimeters

CHOICE E PATTERNS:
  - "Cannot be determined from the information given"
  - Most extreme value (highest or lowest)
  - Least common answer (8-18% correct rate)
