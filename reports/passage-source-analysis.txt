However, they must be SCIENTIFICALLY ACCURATE.

====================================================================================================
PASSAGE CREATION GUIDELINES FOR NEW TESTS:
====================================================================================================

READING PASSAGES:
  Option 1: Use excerpts from published works (with permission/fair use)
  Option 2: Write original passages that match ACT quality standards
  Option 3: Adapt/modify published works (clearly state "adapted from")

  Quality Requirements:
    - College-level reading complexity
    - Clear narrative or argumentative structure
    - 430-826 words depending on type
    - Age-appropriate content
    - Literary/journalistic quality writing

ENGLISH PASSAGES:
  More flexibility - can be original
  Must contain deliberate grammar errors for testing
  279-356 words
  Biographical, historical, or personal narrative topics

SCIENCE PASSAGES:
  Can be original experimental descriptions
  MUST be scientifically accurate
  Data tables must show realistic relationships
  89-414 words depending on type


====================================================================================================
CRITICAL LIMITATION FOR AI GENERATION:
====================================================================================================

For TRUE 1:1 accuracy, reading passages should ideally come from
published sources to match ACT quality standards.

AI-generated passages may:
  - Lack the literary quality of published works
  - Be detectably "AI-written" in style
  - Not match the depth of real journalism/literature

However, for PRACTICE TESTS: AI-generated passages are acceptable
if they meet quality standards (reading level, complexity, length).
