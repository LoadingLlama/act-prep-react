        "passage_text": "There are thousands of new animal species identified each year, the vast majority are small or geographically isolated. So as graduate student Andrea Marshall studied manta rays, which are neither small nor isolated, she didn't expect to identify a new species. Mantas are plankton-eating relatives of stingrays that look like pairs of enormous black wings—up to twenty-five feet wide—flying slowly through the water. Encompassing wide swaths of both temperate and tropical oceans, the manta's range abuts every continent but Antarctica.\n\nDuring Marshall's research off the coast of Mozambique, she observed intriguing physical variations in the mantas she swam amongst. Her beachside lodgings in Mozambique now house the Marine Megafauna Research Center. She began to suspect that the one recognized species of manta might in fact be two species.\n\nTo investigate, Marshall began collecting data. Other data required a closer look. The skin of all mantas, for example, is embedded with tiny, toothlike \"denticles.\" Marshall found that denticles on some mantas were randomly spaced and occasionally overlapped, whereas denticles on other mantas were evenly spaced and never overlapped. Another discovery was that some mantas had egg-shaped masses at the base of their tail fins. Each mass contained a bony spine about an inch long—the vestige of a stinging barb from the manta's ancestors.\n\nIn 2009, Marshall announced, with two other scientists, that indeed there are two manta species. The reef manta, Manta alfredi, is the smaller and more common of the two. Thriving in shallow water, it rarely ventures far from its home territory. In contrast, the giant manta, Manta birostris, favors deep water and migrates thousands of miles a year.\n\nThe fact that such large animals went undifferentiated for so long highlights how little scientists know about these gentle giants. At the moment, manta ray populations face an array of threats worldwide. Fortunately, mantas have a devoted and expert researcher in Dr. Marshall.",

        "introduction": "The history of aspirin from ancient willow bark to modern medicine",
        "passage_text": "When a plant is attacked by bacteria, fungi, or insects, it produces chemicals, called salicylates, that help the plant produce enzymes or toxins capable of destroying the plant's attackers. Salicylates may also play a role in the plant's ability to regulate its temperature, helping the plant tolerate heat and cold. Humans have used the salicylic acids found in plants, particularly in the bark of the willow tree, to fight disease and to reduce fevers.\n\nThe first known references to willow bark's medicinal use date from ancient Egypt and Sumeria. On a Sumerian stone tablet from 3000 BCE, willow is listed among dozens of plants used to treat illnesses. An Egyptian papyrus from about 1534 BCE refers to willow's use as an all-purpose medicine.\n\nThough willow trees are often found near water and have become religious symbols in many cultures, its medicinal use gradually fell out of favor in Europe. The high cost of importing cinchona bark from South America, however, was expensive. Consequently, in the mid-1700s, English minister Edward Stone began to seek a substitute. He noted that the bitter taste of willow bark was reminiscent of the bitter taste of cinchona bark.\n\nKnown also for his interest in astronomy, Stone pulverized some willow bark and added its powder to a liquid. He administered the medicine to people suffering from fevers and then noted that it worked.\n\nAs the field of medicine evolved, so did the use of willow bark. Searching for a way to make the salicylic acid in willow bark less abrasive to the stomach, in 1853 French chemist Charles von Gerhardt created a synthetic version. Decades later, German chemist Felix Hoffmann combined synthetic salicylic acid with acetic acid, inventing a consumer-friendly powdered formula that would come to be known as aspirin.",

        "introduction": "Photographer Martin Klimas creates \"sonic sculptures\" by photographing paint vibrating to music",
        "passage_text": "In his studio in Düsseldorf, Germany, photographer Martin Klimas carefully pours paint onto a rubber membrane placed on top of an audio speaker. The paint collects in a puddle of colors: rich oranges and powder blues, hot pinks and electric yellows. Klimas attaches his camera to a tripod and positions the camera so it is level with the paint puddle. He then sets a sound trigger (a device that automatically snaps a photo when a given sound level is reached) on his camera. Finally, he inserts Daft Punk's Homework CD into a stereo, cranks up the volume to ten, and pushes Play.\n\nThe result is what Klimas calls a \"sonic sculpture.\" The vibrations produced by Daft Punk's dance anthem \"Around the World\" cause the paint to rise, and this image that Klimas's camera captures—sound visually rendered by the effects of the vibrations on the paint. Although Klimas's photographs only capture an instant of the paint erupting in arcs of color, each of the photographs is unique to a given song.\n\n\"I leave the creation of the picture to the sound itself,\" Klimas says. Klimas's idea for his sonic sculptures was sparked by the experiments of Swiss scientist Hans Jenny. In the 1960s, Jenny studied the effects of sound vibrations on various materials. For example, Jenny discovered that low sonic tones caused powdery substances to form into uniform lines, while deeper tones caused the same powder to form into more nuanced patterns. Klimas relies on similar principles, only with a more compelling component: music.\n\nKlimas has photographed sonic sculptures of classical music by Wagner and Bach; jazz by Miles Davis, Charlie Parker, and John Coltrane; and psychedelic rock by Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix. While he acknowledges that all forms of music can generate sonic sculptures, Klimas says, \"I typically select something dynamic and percussive.\" That makes sense. After all, to create his art, Klimas needs his paint to get up and dance.",

        "introduction": "The history of the Columbia River Highway in Oregon",
        "passage_text": "Separating Oregon from Washington, the Columbia River Gorge is eighty-five miles of flowing water, tree-covered bluffs flank the river, and roaring waterfalls. These striking features daunted would-be road builders until 1913. That year, Samuel Hill and Samuel Lancaster, a businessman and an engineer, respectively, began constructing a road through the gorge to connect the towns along the river. Their design went beyond practicalities: it showcased the scenic grandeur of the gorge.\n\nColumbia River Highway was a marvel. Roadside overlooks offered travelers the chance to take in a view of the river or a waterfall. Guardrails made of local rock lined the route and blurred the distinction between road and environment. Engineers created openings in the side of one tunnel, enabling motorists surrounded by rock to glimpse the river below. Completed in 1922, the highway earned the local nickname \"the King of Roads.\"\n\nImpressive as it was, the highway was soon outmoded because of increased traffic and larger vehicles. In time, Oregon built a new road along the Columbia, and much of the highway was destroyed to make room; other stretches were abandoned. By 1954, only the western third of the original road was still in use, mainly by tourists seeking waterfalls. The rest of the highway fell into disrepair.\n\nIn the 1980s, however, local people's interest in the original highway rekindled. In 1981, the National Park Service offered suggestions for restoring parts of the road and repurposing unused sections of it as a trail. Since then, crumbling stone guardrails along the roadside have been repaired. Damaged bridges and viaducts have been rebuilt. Tunnels, once filled with rubble, have been emptied and strengthened. Today, hikers and bikers on the Historic Columbia River Highway Trail experience the splendor of the highway that Hill and Lancaster envisioned over one hundred years ago.",

        "introduction": "Sylvia Robinson and the commercialization of hip-hop music",
        "passage_text": "One night in the late seventies, at a popular club in New York City, singer and music producer Sylvia Robinson had a revelation. At the time, hip-hop subculture—based on the graffiti, breakdancing, deejaying, and rapping art forms—was emerging as a phenomenon. Robinson watched as DJ Lovebug Starski spun records for the crowd and rapped over the instrumental breaks in the music. Every time the DJ chanted, \"Throw your hands in the air,\" everyone obeyed. Robinson could hear the enthusiasm shared between the hip-hop performer and his audience. She knew she had to capture that excitement on record.\n\nRobinson wasted no time in recruiting three aspiring rappers: Big Bank Hank, Master Gee, and Wonder Mike—to record on her label as the Sugarhill Gang. Wanting to re-create the feel-good vibe of the music she'd heard, an upbeat disco record provided the background that the rappers rhymed over. The resulting track, \"Rapper's Delight,\" sold fourteen million copies; Robinson had successfully brought hip-hop music to the mainstream.\n\nNot everyone in the hip-hop community was happy with Robinson's commercial success. Some felt that hip-hop should remain underground, accessible only to its core followers. Others thought Robinson's approach was too pop-oriented and watered down hip-hop's raw, street-level energy. Critics also pointed out that \"Rapper's Delight\" borrowed heavily from the bass line of Chic's disco hit \"Good Times\" without initially crediting the original artists.\n\nDespite the controversy, Robinson's impact on hip-hop cannot be denied. She proved that the genre could be commercially viable, paving the way for countless artists who followed. Her Sugarhill Records label went on to release other influential tracks, including Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's \"The Message,\" which brought social commentary to hip-hop. Robinson's willingness to take a chance on an emerging art form helped transform hip-hop from a local phenomenon into a global cultural force.",

        "passage_text": "Clinton Hill's Found Artist\n\nAt the Urban Vintage, my favorite café here in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, I was reading the newspaper when I noticed an article about Rafael Leonardo Black, a 64-year-old Clinton Hill artist who had just been discovered. Black, a native of Aruba, has been creating art in his New York City studio apartment for over three decades.\n\nHowever, in May of 2013, art dealer Francis Naumann, directed to Black's art by one of Black's longtime friends, displayed sixteen of the artist's drawings in a solo show. The exhibition was an immediate success. Within days, ten of Black's pieces sold for prices ranging from $16,000 to $28,000. The art world had found a hidden treasure.\n\nBlack draws collages in black No. 2 pencil on white board, and they're packed with depictions of ancient myths, historical events, and popular culture. One work that caught my attention was a piece called Seven Lamps. It features a representation of a British psychedelic poster, a portrayal of Danish surrealist painter Wilhelm Freddie at work, and a tiny figure of Los Angeles architect Simon Rodia.\n\nI wasn't sure how the drawings in Seven Lamps—so detailed that I could see the folds in Rodia's clothing—fit together logically, but I liked that there was so much for me to puzzle over. Maybe this complexity helps explain why Black's work created such a stir in the art world.\n\nThe newspaper article claims Black is unmoved by the sudden interest in his art. He continues to work quietly in his studio, focusing on his craft rather than the commercial success. Now that I know about him, when I walk home from the Urban Vintage, I wonder if I'll pass the brownstone building where Black creates his fascinating, newly found art.\n\nFortunately, I found an online gallery featuring several of Black's works, including Seven Lamps. The web page included a key that identified the people, places, and events—most of which I had never even heard of—that Black portrays in his pieces. After studying the key, I realized that Black's art is like a visual encyclopedia, combining disparate elements from across time and culture into coherent artistic statements that reward careful examination and research.",

        "introduction": "The Garamantes civilization in the Sahara Desert",
        "passage_text": "A Mouthful of Music\n\nMouth music is the name given in English to the many ways of imitating the sounds of musical instruments with the human voice. Forms of mouth music are performed around the world, but the genre is particularly popular in England, Ireland, and Scotland. In this Celtic region, lilting and jigging are two of the lively names used to refer to this musical form.\n\nCeltic mouth music exists to accompany dancing, so the rhythms and sounds are first-class and the words take a back seat. Instead of using traditional lyrics, singers often produce nonsense syllables, called vocables, to mimic instrumental music. These syllables are designed to replicate the sounds and rhythmic patterns of fiddles, pipes, and other traditional Celtic instruments.\n\nOne Scottish form of mouth music, puirt-a-beul, is performed entirely in the Gaelic language and accompanies traditional dance steps. The often tongue-twisting lyrics require much practice to perfect. The greater challenge for many puirt-a-beul singers, though, is learning when to breathe. A poorly timed breath might break a song's rhythm and disrupt the dancers' steps.\n\nPuirt-a-beul was most likely invented out of necessity. Musical instruments were scarce in isolated Scottish villages, so to fill the void, mouth music emerged and provided residents with the music they wanted for dancing. Additionally, puirt-a-beul gave anyone who didn't read music a way to learn and pass on traditional songs.\n\nAnother form of mouth music that originated in Scotland is the waulking song. These work songs were traditionally sung by women as they prepared newly woven cloth by soaking, beating, and stretching it. The rhythmic nature of the work naturally lent itself to musical accompaniment, and the songs helped coordinate the workers' movements while making the labor more enjoyable.\n\nThe continuing popularity of Celtic mouth music is testament to its vitality. In the 1990s, groups like Mouth Music from Scotland and The Cranberries from Ireland rose to fame, exposing Celtic mouth music to audiences worldwide. The bands' celebrity continually survives as they combine traditional mouth music with modern rhythms, keeping this ancient art form alive for new generations.",

        "passage_text": "Neutrinos on Ice\n\nAt the IceCube Neutrino Observatory in Antarctica, eighty-six cables descend 2,500 meters into the glacial terrain. Each cable is equipped with sixty digital optical modules (DOMs), which are programmed to detect a faint blue flash known as Cherenkov radiation. This radiation—a veritable shock wave of photonic energy—is emitted when subatomic particles called neutrinos collide with electrons in the molecules of ice.\n\nAlthough there are countless neutrinos in the universe (fifty trillion neutrinos pass through your body every second), actually detecting them is a formidable task. Neutrinos carry no electrical charge, are practically weightless, and travel at nearly the speed of light. Neutrinos are rarely affected by matter or electromagnetic fields. For this reason, many neutrinos have been traveling through space unimpeded for billions of years.\n\nOn some occasions, however, neutrinos do collide with other particles. Scientists specifically selected the site of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory to facilitate the detection of such a collision. Not only is the Antarctic subterranean ice exceptionally clear, it is also less pressurized due to its subzero altitude. Once this detection occurs, data is gathered and transferred to laboratories at the University of Wisconsin.\n\nDetermining neutrinos' origins could provide scientists with new insights into the universe. For instance, some neutrinos are produced during supernovae (the collapsing of stars). The origins of these neutrinos could give us invaluable information about how, when, and why stars collapse. By tracking neutrinos from deep space, scientists hope to learn more about the most violent events in the universe.\n\nThe IceCube Neutrino Observatory represents a new frontier in astronomy, one that uses particles rather than light to explore the cosmos. As scientists continue to detect and analyze neutrinos from distant cosmic events, they are building a more complete picture of how the universe works. This particle-based approach to astronomy could revolutionize our understanding of space and lead to discoveries that traditional light-based telescopes could never achieve.",

        "passage_text": "Cher Ami, Pigeon Hero\n\nPigeons have a fairly poor reputation. In many urban areas, they are considered little more than \"rats with wings,\" blamed for spreading disease and despoiling statues. However, one species, the homing pigeon, is among the best navigators of the natural world. Their navigational abilities have earned the homely pigeon an undeniable place in history.\n\nBefore modern technologies like the radio or telephone, commanders on the battlefield often faced challenges in communicating, depending on their location. The homing pigeon provided a solution to this problem. It flew high and always quickly returned to its home roost. One of six hundred birds used by the US Army Signal Corps in France during World War I, Cher Ami flew twelve successful missions.\n\nCher Ami's most famous flight took place in October 1918, during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. American forces had advanced deep into German territory when a battalion of the 77th Infantry Division found itself trapped behind enemy lines. The men were surrounded by German troops and were rapidly running out of rations. They were separated from other US forces. They had but one link to headquarters: homing pigeons.\n\nAs it became clear that the Americans were unaware of the 77th's whereabouts, the situation grew dire. The battalion released two pigeons with messages requesting help, but both birds were shot down by German fire. Cher Ami was their last hope.\n\nWhen released, the bird immediately came under enemy fire. A bullet pierced his breast, another shattered his leg, but still Cher Ami flew on. Twenty-five minutes later, he reached his destination, delivering the message that would save 194 American soldiers. The rescue mission was launched immediately, and the \"Lost Battalion\" was found and evacuated to safety.\n\nNews reports around the world touted the bird's heroism. The French military awarded Cher Ami a medal, the War Cross. Although one might question the extent to which Cher Ami understood his mission, his story proves that pigeons are remarkable creatures capable of extraordinary acts. Cher Ami's story is testimony to the homing pigeon's navigational skill and instinct, demonstrating that even in the most desperate circumstances, these birds can accomplish what seems impossible.",

        "passage_text": "Making the Desert Bloom\n\nMore than two thousand years ago, a people the Romans called the Garamantes created a complex civilization in one of the world's driest places—the Sahara Desert. Beginning around 500 BCE, they built towns and villages, manufactured cloth and jewelry, and traded throughout North Africa and the Mediterranean. They also grew a variety of crops, including wheat, barley, and millet.\n\nThe survival of their civilization depended on hundreds of miles of underground tunnels. These tunnels carried water to desert settlements from an aquifer, an underground layer of water-bearing rock. The Garamantes learned to build foggaras (underground aqueducts) by digging vertical shafts down to the water table, then connecting them with horizontal tunnels. When the tunnels reached a town or field, the water flowed into more easily accessible surface canals or reservoirs.\n\nArchaeologists don't know how the Garamantes learned to build foggaras. Other such tunnels existed in Iran, Algeria, Tunisia, and elsewhere. Because the canals were underground, the water they carried stayed clean and didn't evaporate. And because the water came from an aquifer rather than from rainfall, the supply was unaffected by drought. The Garamantes could rely on a constant supply of water for drinking, washing, and irrigation. Moreover, the cold, damp air of the foggaras lowered the temperature inside the homes that were built over them, resulting in an ancient form of air-conditioning.\n\nThe Garamantes thrived until about 500 CE, when some archaeologists believe they began to deplete the aquifer. As the foggaras supplied less and less water, the Garamantes' population declined, and their civilization eventually collapsed. However, at least six hundred of the ancient foggaras survive. The stone mounds that mark their ventilation shafts are still visible in what is now southwestern Libya.",

While all of Norway has precious few sunlit hours in winter, Rjukan is tucked in a valley between two mountain ridges that completely block sunlight from late September to mid-March. Yet despite the mountains, an oval of afternoon sunlight bathes the market square, thanks to the Solspeil—\"sun mirror.\"\n\nAfter moving to Rjukan in 2001, the prolonged winter gloom alarmed artist Martin Andersen. He wondered if mirrors placed on one of the ridges above Rjukan could change the situation.\n\nHe learned that in 1913 local bookkeeper Oscar Kittelsen had proposed erecting mirrors for the same purpose, and instead Sam Eyde, the town's founder, had considered the idea. However, Eyde did not follow through on construction of the mirrors, and he abandoned the idea.\n\nOne hundred years later, Andersen made the mirrors a reality. Three 550-square-foot mirrors were airlifted to the top of a ridge 1,475 feet above Rjukan. Helicopters carried the heavy equipment up the mountain, moreover, no roads led to the cliffside construction site. Since a crane would have been too heavy for helicopters to lift, workers used tools such as thirty-foot wooden tripods to install the mirrors.\n\nThe three mirrors team up as a group to create a bright 2,000-square-foot ellipse of light in the town square. To keep the light on the square, the mirrors adjust every ten seconds, tracking the sun as it crosses the sky.\n\nThey're controlled wirelessly by a company in Germany, and monitored in Rjukan and on the mountain via webcam. The light rays that reaches the town is between 80 and 100 percent as bright as direct sunlight.",

The word hints at the importance of oral tradition hundreds of years ago in Anglo-Saxon England. Between the fifth and twelfth centuries, this tradition was upheld by scops, professional poets who sang or recited poetry at ceremonies.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, however, the ability to write wasn't common, even among royalty. Narratives such as the heroic epic Beowulf and the mournful poem The Seafarer have been passed on through spoken word for centuries. The position of scop required not only great memorization skills but also the ability to compose epic works on a regular basis. Scops became the keepers of poems, songs, and even the histories of their people.\n\nSkilled scops were valued so highly in Anglo-Saxon society that they were sometimes granted extra rewards for their talents. In fact, there are several records of royals giving land to deserving scops. Coins or gold rings—which could be used as status symbols to display one's success—were common gifts for scops who did well.\n\nTo achieve this kind of success, a scop needed to transcend being just an entertainer in a mead hall. While mindful of the expectation that they would glorify their leaders, scops set standards for morality through their celebration of heroes and condemnation of villains. A scop was also a moral compass for the community. Therefore, a person's reputation could rise or fall by the scop's hand. Additionally, scops preserved and conveyed through history from one generation to the next, providing a type of immortality traditionally revered by the Anglo-Saxons. More than a storyteller, the scop was a historian, teacher, and messenger of community values. The scop's call of \"Hwet!\" was an invitation to audiences to gather and celebrate their culture.",

        "passage_text": "Last June while I was visiting family in Maine, my uncle Lee invited me, a total city girl, to his \"summer office\"—a nickname for his boat. He's a teacher, but in the summer he salvages sunken logs from lakes and sells them. So one morning as we walked to the dock to ready the pontoon, a versatile type of boat that's essentially a platform atop two hollow metal flotation cylinders. After a chilly ride across Moosehead Lake, we reached a bay that Uncle Lee had tagged on his GPS. He activated the boat's sonar and piloted slowly forward as we watched a monitor. Soon, ghostly images appeared on the screen, showing what looked like a jumble of matchsticks on the lake bottom. They weren't matchsticks, of course, but sunken logs.\n\nFor centuries, Maine loggers sent their harvests to market by floating them down rivers. When the logs reached Moosehead Lake, they were bound together and towed to lakeside sawmills. Each year, some of the logs sank. In the deep water, protected from insects and oxygen, the wood remained well preserved.\n\nOn the boat, another monitor displayed the underwater video camera's view of the grapple arm reaching for a log that Uncle Lee thought was birch. The arm's iron pinchers grasped the log, coaxed it from beneath another log, and, aided by a winch, pulled it from the depths. When the log surfaced, it looked like a slimy, hefty telephone pole. As my uncle lashed the log to the boat, he pointed out the axe marks on the wood. Because it was felled by an axe, he explained, the tree was probably cut in the mid-nineteenth century. Add to that the age of the tree—easily two hundred years—and we were looking at a birch may have started life a century before the Declaration of Independence.\n\nBy the end of the day, I'd gotten pretty good at operating the grapple arm, and we had nine logs tied to the boat. Uncle Lee said that one day last year he hauled out twenty logs, but some days he'd leave the lake without finding a single salvageable log. Our load of high-quality wood would become beautiful furniture or flooring, complete with an immersing backstory.",

        "passage_text": "Meenakshi Wadhwa was pursuing her PhD when a professor asked her if she wanted to see a meteorite from Mars. Wadhwa was struck by how similar the rock's chemical makeup was to that of Earth rocks. Since then, the idea that she could learn about the composition of distant worlds by studying meteorites has driven Wadhwa's career ever since.\n\nAfter graduating, Wadhwa became the curator of the meteorite collection at The Field Museum in Chicago, where she conducted research on meteorites, especially those from Mars. Wadhwa used a mass spectrometer to identify and measure the elements in meteorite samples. The mass spectrometer revealed the rocks' age and hinted at the processes that created them. This information helped Wadhwa better understand the geological history of Mars.\n\nIn 2006, Wadhwa became the director of the Center for Meteorite Studies at Arizona State University. With more than 1,800 space rocks, including samples from Mars and the asteroid belt. The meteorite collection Wadhwa oversees is the largest at any university. Because meteorites contain material that predates Earth, Wadhwa and her colleagues can learn about the elements that were present when the Sun, planets, and moons formed.\n\nWadhwa's research has shed light on the early history of the solar system. For example, a 2010 study she cowrote found that the solar system is likely 1.9 million years older than the previous estimate. In 2013, Wadhwa and two colleagues discovered evidence that a supernova that exploded before the planets formed likely seeded our solar system with many essential elements.\n\nOf the many honors Wadhwa's research has earned her, perhaps the most meaningful one came from astronomers Carolyn and Gene Shoemaker. After discovering an asteroid, they asked the International Astronomical Union to name it after Wadhwa. The asteroid's orbit crosses that of the Red Planet, meaning that one day, as Wadhwa put it, she \"just might have an impact on Mars.\"",

        "introduction": "Essay about Stax Records and its influence on 1960s soul music",
        "passage_text": "Stax Records of Memphis, Tennessee, may be less renowned than Detroit's Motown, but its contributions to 1960s American soul music were no less significant. Stax, which had a grittier, funkier sound than Motown's, blending elements of country, gospel, and rhythm & blues. But beyond genre, it was the people, their methods, and even the building itself (which had once been a movie theater) that made Stax one of the most exceptional recording studios of the era.\n\nStax's unlikely founders, siblings Jim Stewart and Estelle Axton, were bankers who loved music. They knew little about the music industry or soul, but they had open minds and encouraged collaboration. Their open-door policy allowed unestablished or unconventional artists to make their names at Stax. Booker T. Jones, Carla Thomas, and Otis Redding were just a few of more than thirty artists all became a part of the musical \"conversation\" happening there.\n\nThat conversation included a range of perspectives rarely found at other studios. Despite the pervasive segregation of Memphis in the 1960s, the Stax staff and house band were fully integrated. The \"Stax family\" also included people of various ages and economic backgrounds, all contributed to Stax's unique sound.\n\nAnother distinction was one of method. At most studios, performers worked from previously arranged sheet music. In contrast, Stax musicians spontaneously composed music together, a practice called head arranging. Otis Redding might walk in and sing a few lyrics to the band. The other musicians would riff on his idea until a complete song emerged from the collaboration. Then, they'd record the song without ever putting the notes on paper.\n\nEven the building helped to create the Stax sound. Recording equipment in the 1960s was rudimentary by today's standards. But the former theater's sloped floor and bass-heavy movie speakers gave recordings a deep, raw tone so distinctive that aficionados can often recognize a Stax song within the first few notes.",

The cold air snapped Yueming out of an afternoon daze. At the corner of Tenth and Winter, someone had cleared the snow in front of the mural, one of the several that were part of Yueming's daily commute. This one The History of Chinatown, looked especially bright today, the sun's reflection off the snow, working some magic with the colors.\n\nThere, in paint, Chinese immigrants worked their jobs, one bent over a clothes iron, others caught up in railroad construction, and a giant figure on the horizon, his gaze locked on the passerby. In the lower left-hand corner, a child no bigger than Wei tugged at a kite in a schoolyard. As many times as she had seen them, these figures still caught Yueming off guard, incongruous as they were—motionless—with the rush of Philadelphia's urban city traffic heading for the Vine Street Expressway.\n\nMother and Wei would come tomorrow after this visit, their next one would be for Yueming's graduation.

Yet the limited time divers may remain underwater—often no more than two hours—has led scientists to call for robots able to help conduct observations in an assistive capacity. Complex functions like detecting chemicals and mapping topography, and these have already been implemented in robots with wide success. The bigger challenge is teaching a robot to swim.\n\n[2]\nPowerful thrusters have helped some robots surge through the depths. Such equipment, however can alarm or even harm sea life. The engineers developing the robot AQUA2 imagined a robot able to use advanced imaging and electromechanical systems. To do so, it would need to swim as naturally as a fish, a squid, or—as it turned out—a turtle.\n\n[3]\nAQUA2 has also proved remarkably well adapted to land. Its flippers reverse direction in shallow water, pushing the robot up onto sturdy, arched legs. The legs propel the robot out of the surf. Rubber treads on each leg allow AQUA2 to scale sand dunes or snowbanks, making the robot as suitable for studies in the Caribbean as well as those in the Arctic.\n\n[4]\nLike its biological counterpart, AQUA2 has flippers that allow it to glide through the water, dive to the ocean floor, and ascend from the bottom. Unlike thruster-powered robots, AQUA2 can make subtle changes in course simply by altering the positions of its flippers. By holding two flippers still, as it gently paddles, with the other four, for example, the robot can \"hover\" in place underwater. This exquisite competency will allow it to avoid disturbing the sea life it is designed to observe.\n\n[5]\nNow, AQUA2 faces a new challenge; even more tricky than reacting to different terrains is interacting with human divers. During field tests amid busy coral reefs in Barbados and the silty beds of lakes in Canada, AQUA2 practices following divers' instructions. Soon, scientists may be able to conduct more frequent, more efficient dives with robotic partners at their sides.",

Today, the park is a refuge for sea turtles, manatees, and alligators. In the 1960s, though, land developers saw commercial potential for the area. Some wanted to build an oil refinery. [A] Others, because of Biscayne Bay's natural beauty, wanted beach resorts. However, Lancelot Jones, one of two year-round residents, of the islands wanted to preserve the bay.\n\n[2]\nPorgy Key had always been home for Jones, a small island in Biscayne Bay. His father had purchased the land for $300 in 1897, and Jones grew up there, cultivating pineapples and Key limes. Therefore, in 1935, Jones began guiding fishing trips; his knowledge of fishing earned him the reputation for being the area's best fishing guide. [B] Among his clientele were several US presidents, including: Hoover, Kennedy, and Nixon.\n\n[3]\n[1] In 1961, fourteen of the eighteen landowners came to Biscayne Bay and voted to found a city on the bay's islands to expedite commercial development of the land. [2] Jones abstained from voting. [3] He refused to sell his land because he wanted the area to be conserved.\n\n[4]\nJones wasn't alone, some Florida residents, and frequent visitors sought to preserve Biscayne Bay by turning it into a national park. Their efforts were furthered by Miami Herald reporter Juanita Greene, whose articles helped sway public opinion. [C] Finally, in 1968, President Johnson signed a bill that put the bay under federal protection.\n\n[5]\nFirst to sell their land to the National Park Service was Lancelot Jones, who was permitted to remain on Porgy Key. Since he still led fishing trips, and he taught schoolchildren about the environment of Biscayne Bay. [D] In exchange for teaching each class, he asked only for a Key lime pie in return for the class. Jones lived alone, but he said, \"When you have plenty of interests, like the water and the woods, the birds and the fish, you don't get lonely.\"",

Video surveillance revealed the culprits; two northern flickers, a species of woodpecker, was attempting to excavate a nest in the fuel tank's foam insulation. Upon striking the solid metal beneath, the flickers would stubbornly choose a new spot and try again.\n\n[1] In the northern United States, where most flickers return each summer to mate and raise broods, the birds' persistence is well known. [2] By lacking a distinct song, flickers drum their beaks against hard surfaces to announce themselves to mates. [3] The louder the noise an object makes, the more attractive it is to flickers. [4] Among their favorite noisemakers are drainpipes, TV antennas, and even farm equipment. [5] At the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, though the flickers' persistence seemed mysterious. [6] Worse, it posed a serious risk. [7] For solid metal to stop the birds from trying to nest at the launch site, how could NASA prevent damage to its equipment and keep the species safe?\n\nNASA put together a committee, dubbed the Bird Investigation Review and Deterrent (BIRD) team, to consult with wildlife experts. After learning that flickers seek out soft, rotted wood when excavating nests, the team recommended the removal of dead trees from the area. For instance, upon learning that flickers forage for food on the ground, BIRD determined that tidy lawns made crawling insects easily visible. The team advised NASA to let the grass grow long to give the birds the impression that food was hard to catch.\n\nOther, less subtle strategies were implemented to ensure that the birds didn't settle in. Deterred by plastic owls and floating balloons, alternatively, the flickers soon left for new territory. Their visit to the launchpad, however, was not soon forgotten. Discovery's successful launch was delayed five weeks while workers flocked to repair the fuel tank the flickers had favored.",

Her Tanztheater, translated \"dance theater,\" pieces received international acclaim for those expressive, unconventional style and the often-raw emotional feelings they portrayed.\n\n[2]\nWhen Bausch began her formal dance education in 1955, Expressionism was again the dominant style. Bausch followed the Expressionists' lead (and that of other dance pioneers like Martha Graham from the '20s). She tackled existential themes—identity, alienation, romantic entanglements, suffering—portrayed through intense, sometimes violent, movements.\n\n[3]\nBy the 1920s and up until the onset of World War II. German art was flourishing and had turned to the abstract. Expressionism, as it was called, replaced representational, or literal, modes of painting. Bausch, born in 1940, having grown up in postwar Germany. The country was attempting to rebuild its economy, its infrastructure, and even the country's national identification after the fall of Hitler's regime. German artists, of whom work was previously suppressed by the Nazi party, could refresh without fear. They began to depict the country's fragile state in their work.\n\n[4]\nA Bausch piece may include any number of dancers of any age. Dancers' emotions are conveyed through gestures—joy, passion, grief—that range from subtle to explosive, stationary to dynamic. In Café Miiller, one of her most famous works, dancers stumble across the stage, crashing into tables and chairs. Rite of Spring begins with a dancer lying prostrate on a stage, covered entirely with soil.\n\n[5]\nTravel to places such as Turkey, Portugal, and India have informed much of Bausch's work. She, often, incorporated, and combined dance traditions from the East and West, inspiring future choreographers. Her lasting influence lives on through revivals of her work.",

Inspired by the dots and dashes of Morse code, however, Woodland and Silver created a system of lines that could encode data. Called a symbology, the pattern created by the spacing and widths of the lines encodes information by representing different characters.\n\n[2]\nThe first bar code was composed of four white lines set at specific distances from each other on a black background. The first line was always present. Depending on the presence or absence of the remaining three lines, up to seven different arrangements were susceptible and, therefore, seven different encodings. Today, twenty-nine white lines making more than half a billion encodings possible.\n\n[3]\nTo create a bar code scanner, Woodland and Silver adapted technology from an optical movie sound system. Their prototype scanner used a 500-watt bulb, a photomultiplier tube (a device that detects light), and an oscilloscope (a device that translates electronic signals into readable information). Although successful, the concoction was both large and costly. For example, progress stalled until the 1970s, when laser technology (both more compact and less expensive) became available.\n\n[4]\nIn today's scanners, a laser sends light back and forth across a bar code. While the black lines absorb the light, the white lines reflect it back at a fixed mirror inside the scanner. In this way, the scanner reads the symbology and decodes the information.\n\n[5]\nToday, being that there are one- and two-dimensional bar codes using numeric and alphanumeric symbologies. Bar codes are used not only for a pack of gum or an airline ticket, but also for research. In one study, for instance, tiny bar codes were placed on bees tracking their activities. Shaping the way we gather, track, and share information, we have almost certainly exceeded even Woodland and Silver's expectations.",

While I was traveling on canoe on a group tour through the renowned Glowworm Grotto of New Zealand's Waitomo Caves. Were it not for the twinkling light of these Arachnocampa luminosa, a species unique to New Zealand and abundant in these caves, this meandering subterranean passageway would feel as though it were downright ensconced in shadows.\n\nI sheepishly tucked the camera away and focused again on the glowworms. Collectively, they resembled the cosmos, a sea of stars in a clear night sky. Beautiful—yet what made them glow?\n\n\"Bioluminescence,\" the woman said, peculiarly sensing my curiosity. A badge was pinned to her shirt indicated she was a biochemist, here, I guessed, to research the organism.\n\nShe explained that to attract prey, glowworms (not really worms at all, but the larval stage of a fungus gnat) emit light through their translucent skin; via a cellular chemical reaction. The cells produce luciferin, a chemical pigment that reacts with oxygen to produce light that shines through the organism's tail-end intestine. From its mouth, she showed me, all glowworms dangle shimmering silken threads glossed in beads of mucus. Cave-dwelling insects are trapped in these threads, then reeled in like fish on a line, and finally lured by the light.\n\nThe light responds to environmental factors. The sound of splashing water, however, might signal that prey is nearby, causing them to brighten.\n\nOur trip neared its end. I spotted a dragonfly in the cave.

There, I will deposit these clippings in rich soil; roots will take hold, buds will sprout, and a new plant will find a home in my garden.\n\nMy roses are not your average hybrid-tea roses (those long-stemmed, special occasion roses with well-formed buds). Mine are antique roses, old, or heirloom varieties, that have existed in gardens worldwide for centuries.\n\nEach of my antique roses has a story. The 'Autumn Damask' rose, for example, is thought to have been brought to Europe from the Middle East by returning crusaders. Legend has it that this rose was even used in ancient Rome to make perfume. Today, it still fills my garden with its rich fragrance.\n\nAnother favorite is the 'Old Blush' rose, which was one of the first roses introduced to Europe from China in the late 1700s. This rose blooms repeatedly throughout the growing season, a trait that made it invaluable to rose breeders who wanted to create roses that bloomed more than once per year.\n\nWhat draws me to antique roses is their hardiness and resilience. Unlike many modern roses, antique roses generally require less maintenance, are more resistant to disease, and adapt well to various climates. They don't need much fertilizer or pruning, and they can thrive with minimal intervention.\n\nBut perhaps what I love most about antique roses is their connection to history. Each time I walk through my garden, I'm reminded that the same roses that grow in my backyard once grew in medieval European gardens, ancient Chinese imperial courts, and Victorian English estates. These roses have been witnesses to centuries of human history.\n\nAs I place my cutting in the greenhouse, I think about the gardeners who came before me, carefully propagating these same varieties, ensuring their survival for future generations. I feel honored to be part of this living tradition, preserving these beautiful and historic plants for the gardeners who will come after me.",

The tradition dates back hundreds of years, when Passamaquoddy people used baskets for storing food, carrying goods, and trading with European settlers.\n\nTraditional Passamaquoddy baskets were made from ash trees that grew in the forests of Maine. Basket makers would harvest strips of ash wood, pound them to separate the growth rings, and weave the thin strips into sturdy, functional baskets.

This would be no simple timepiece and because Chinese dynasties continued to astrology, they relied on complicated clocks that not only kept time but also helped track stars, planets, the sun, and the moon. An eminent scientist and bureaucrat named Su Song lead Zhezong's ambitious project.\n\nUsing his expertise in calendrical science, Su Song designed a clock tower that stood over 30 feet tall. The tower housed an elaborate mechanism powered by water. A large water wheel turned continuously, moving a complex system of gears and wheels that drove the clock's many functions.\n\nThe clock displayed the time on several different scales. One display showed the hour of the day using a traditional Chinese system that divided the day into twelve two-hour periods. Another display tracked the positions of celestial bodies. Mechanical figures appeared at regular intervals to ring bells and gongs, announcing the hours.\n\nWhat made Su Song's clock remarkable was its use of an escapement mechanism—a device that regulated the flow of power to the clock's gears, ensuring that the clock kept accurate time. This was one of the earliest known uses of an escapement in a mechanical clock, predating similar developments in European clockmaking by several centuries.\n\nUnfortunately, Su Song's clock tower did not survive. When the Jin dynasty conquered northern China in 1127, they dismantled the clock and attempted to rebuild it in their capital. However, no one understood how it worked, and it was never successfully reconstructed. Today, we know about Su Song's clock tower only through detailed descriptions and diagrams that Su Song himself created.\n\nDespite its loss, Su Song's clock remains an important milestone in the history of timekeeping. It demonstrates the sophistication of Chinese science and engineering in the medieval period and reminds us that technological innovation occurred in many parts of the world, often independently of one another.",

        "passage_text": "[1]\nUS history books have traditionally chronicled the actions of male Revolutionary War heroes such as George Washington, Paul Revere, and John Paul Jones. Increasingly, such books include accounts of the many brave women which also contributed—as spies and soldiers—to the effort to gain independence from British rule.\n\n[2]\nDeborah Sampson of Plympton, Massachusetts, was one of these women. In 1782, despite the fact that women weren't allowed to serve in the military, twenty-one-year-old Sampson joined the colonial army. She disguised herself as a man and enlisted under the name of Robert Shurtliff.\n\n[3]\nFor fourteen months Sampson served in the army, she acted with exceptional bravery and fortitude. Her commanding officers quickly recognized these traits and sent her on several special missions. On one such mission near West Point, New York, Sampson was part of a scouting party whose assignment to track and capture a British convoy. While pursuing several British soldiers into a swamp, Sampson was shot in the leg. Fearing that her true identity would be discovered, she did not report to the hospital. Instead, Sampson removed the musket ball by herself.\n\n[4]\nOn another scouting mission, Sampsons' party, was ambushed by British soldiers. To escape the scouts had to wade across a river. A fierce current swept Sampson into deep waters. It was the weight of her heavy backpack and musket, Sampson struggled. For instance, a colonial soldier standing on a sandbar threw her a rope. Summoning her strength, Sampson plucked from the air that which was to save her and made it to shore. [A]\n\n[5]\nSampson survived the winter and spring with her secret undiscovered. [B] In July 1783, however, she was found out. [C] While this meant that she could no longer serve in the army, her exemplary record as a soldier was officially recognized. [D] Later, she was awarded a military pension as a sign of gratitude from the young nation she had helped found.",

        "passage_text": "[1]\nWith a full career in both politics and business, Hiram Fong never set out to develop one of Oahu's most spectacularly horticulture attractions. [A] Fong, whose political career spanned over thirty years, was one of the first two senators from Hawaii to become a state in 1959 and the first Asian American to serve in the US Senate.\n\nPrior to working in politics, Fong paid his own way through Harvard Law School and, upon graduating, was a part of a law firm. [B] All the while, gardening was his escape.\n\n[2]\nWanting to experiment with growing fruit, he planted bananas, then papaya, lemon, jackfruit, and avocado. [C] By also choosing to plant crops such as bamboo, coconut, betel nut, and turmeric, he broadened the types of plants in his garden. He cultivated slopes covered with ti and pili grasses and forests of trees such as kukui, hala, and koa, vegetation previously an abundance on Oahu.\n\n[3]\nAfter he retired from politics in 1977, Fong continued to oversee his companies, but he focused on gardening, personally importing and planting countless species of plants. Eventually, he divided his land into five gardens, each one named for a US president whom had served while Fong was a senator. The Eisenhower Plateau is dedicated to native Chinese plants, such as the Hong Kong orchid tree and the Java plum. The Johnson Plateau features exotic fruits. Kennedy Valley, with its rain forest canopy, recommends ginger and palms from all over the world. Nixon Valley will abound with flowers—plumeria, crown flower, and bougainvillea are just a few—while the Ford Plateau highlights hillsides of pili grasses.\n\n[4]\nThe preserve, bearing his name, is now named Senator Fong's Plantation and Gardens, complete with a visitors' center and guided tours. [D] Until his death in 2004 at ninety-seven, Fong spent every weekend tending to his flowers and trees and a moment to mingle with visitors. He credited gardening for his long, healthy life.",

        "passage_text": "[1]\nTwo men ascend the face of Ball's Pyramid—a rocky island in the Tasman Sea that looks like a mountain jutting up from the waves. The men, Nicholas Carlile and Dean Hiscox, have cameras and flashlights; it is dark. They are heading for a specific melaleuca bush that is hanging 225 feet above the ocean. When they reach it, they find twenty-four enormous black insects. Wingless and up to fifteen inches long, the men see Dryococelus australis—a nocturnal species that had been believed to be extinct for over eighty years.\n\n[2]\nDryococelus australis, also known as the Lord Howe stick insect, is native to Lord Howe Island, located less than fifteen miles to Ball's Pyramid. [A] The insects are so large that 1800s European sailors called them \"tree lobsters.\" The animals thrived on Lord Howe Island until 1918, when a British supply ship ran aground while the ship was being repaired, rats escaped onto the island and quickly wiped out the stick insects.\n\n[3]\nBy 1920, the insects were presumed to be extinct. For decades, though the island's remote location and dangerous waters made a thorough search difficult, so the insects' survival wasn't confirmed until 2001. [B]\n\n[4]\nCarlile and Hiscox's find raised a question—what should be done with the rare insects? In 2003, the Australian government permitted the removal of four insects from the island in order to bring the species back in the brink of extinction. [C] Two of the insects were transported to the Melbourne Zoo, where invertebrate conservation expert Patrick Honan, took charge of it. Starting with only thirty eggs, Honan was able to activate the population of these rare insects. [D]\n\n[5]\nThough the species is now safe, the insects' fame is spreading. Some stick insects will remain at the zoo as an \"insurance population,\" but the ultimate goal is to reintroduce the insects to their native habitat on Lord Howe Island.",

        "passage_text": "[1]\nBefore texting, e-mail, and even the telephone call, there was Morse code. Transmitted over telegraph wire or radio waves via pulses of electric current, Morse code, which was used for over a century, the standard for rapid long-distance communication, especially for those at sea. [A] In 1995, however, the US Coast Guard suspended it's usage of Morse code, including the international distress signal SOS. Despite the speed and precision of technologies such as global positioning satellites, decoding signals in Morse code had become inefficient.\n\n[2]\nTo some, the decision signaled the end of Morse code. Morse code's enduring utility, they argue, lays in the fact that it functions less like a technology then a language—one that can reliably transmit a message under almost any conditions. [B]\n\n[3]\nIn Morse code, each letter of the unique Roman alphabet consists of a pattern of short and long signals called dots and dashes. [C] Though Morse code was used longer than any electrical coding system, spelling out and translating messages in Morse code does not require specialized machines. Messages can be transmitted by clicking a flashlight on and off, by flashing a mirror in the sun, or simply blinking. [D] The code can also be spoken aloud, with the words dit and dah substituted for dots and dashes, or rendered rhythmically, allowing people to communicate via handheld buzzers.\n\n[4]\nBecause of its versatility, Morse code can prove valuable in ensuring public safety when more sophisticated equipment fails. Air traffic controllers can revert to Morse code if radar or satellite signals are interrupted. Similarly, amateur radio operators can use the code during weather emergencies to solicit information from outside the affected area. The news is relayed by them, by which they can keep people safe and informed.\n\nNew communication technologies will continue to emerge, meanwhile Morse code, with its lack of sophistication, could remain just as effective an asset.",

On the side of a building in London, a stenciled image depicts a pair of uniformed soldiers painting a vibrant red peace sign. Although nearly no one knows what this artist looks like, there are many who know his work. Blending sharp-tongued social commentary with humor and whimsy British-born artist, Banksy, has made a name for himself by challenging people's perceptions of the relevance of street art.\n\nIn the beginning, Banksy's fame originated on the streets of Bristol, England, in the early 1990s. Under the cover of the night sky, Banksy worked quickly and steadily, sometimes painting freehand, sometimes spray-painting elaborately detailed stencils.\n\nConcerned residents argued that Banksy's work was simply graffiti that encouraged vandalism. Others praised it as art done by and for the people and debated for more.\n\nEngland's strict anti-graffiti policy meant that most of Banksy's pieces were destroyed within mere hours of there completion.\n\nAfterward, only a blank wall stood where Banksy's art had been. By the end of the decade, Banksy had expanded his influence, painting his messages in places well beyond the British border. Seemingly he is everywhere and nowhere at once, Banksy had the full attention of the art world. Museum directors organized Banksy exhibitions, and auctioneers sold actual pieces of buildings that bore Banksy's artistry.\n\nDespite his popularity, Banksy has not given in to the hype. He does not reproduce and sell prints of his images for profit. He also continues to communicate with the public through his street art, which is possible in part because he has managed to keep his identity secret. In Banksy's own words, \"Art is not like other culture because its success is not made by its audience.\"",

        "passage_text": "Among the treasures found in Pharaoh Tutankhamen's tomb, in the 1920s one diminutive ornament poses a mystery that spans the ages. The \"pectoral,\" a kind of jewelry worn on one's chest depicts Egyptian symbols with gold and gems. Most strikingly, at the piece's center is a beetle carved from an ethereal yellow-green material.\n\n[1] Originally, archaeologists identified the beetle as chalcedony, a quartz gemstone. [2] In 1996, likewise, mineralogist Vincenzo de Michele noticed the beetle at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and suspected it wasn't chalcedony. [3] After studying the beetle, he determined it to be 28.5-million-year-old glass. [4] De Michele then traced the glass to the Great Sand Sea of western Egypt, where pieces of it lay strewn across 6,500 square kilometers. [5] Glass is made by heating substances, such as, sand. [6] Though lava and lightning strikes can create glass the desert glass's traces of the elements iridium and osmium pointed to an unearthly culprit: a meteoroid. [7] It's true that the tremendous heat and pressure around the globe of meteorite impacts in many places have created glass. [8] But meteorites leave craters, and their was no crater that could account for the desert glass.\n\nIn recent years, scientists John Wasson and Mark Boslough have put their research-whiz brains to work on a new explanation for the desert glass. Intrigued by the 1994 collision of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter and a 1908 meteoroid airburst over a remote region of Russia that flattened 80 million trees but left no crater, they ran sophisticated computer simulations. Their conclusion: a meteoroid burned up in the atmosphere, but its fireball reached Earth and scorched an expanse of sandstone to temperatures above 1,800°C.\n\nImagination can take the story through there. Some three thousand years ago, an artisan admired a piece of desert glass; so gorgeous that, with a little carving, it would befit a great pharaoh.",

Protruding from the windows of the old brick building in front of me were four enormous, bright-pink tentacles (they must have been twenty-five feet long!) that waved in the slight breeze. I didn't wait around to get a full view of the creature. Instead, I put the car in reverse, driving home, figured my friends could have dinner without me.\n\nWhile I was somewhat familiar with the Norse legend of the squid-like kraken, a mythological sea creature that resembled an oversize squid. Supposedly, the kraken could wrap an entire ship in its tentacled embrace eventually swallowing the ship whole—sailors and all. But the kraken of Norse legend certainly never frequented the homes or places of business. And who had ever heard of a neon-pink sea monster?\n\nA month after my ordeal, my friend Rhonda called me and asked if I was feeling okay. I was just starting to relax and enjoy our nighttime stroll when we turned onto Mulberry Avenue. I must have made a noise—a yelp, or perhaps a blood-curdling scream because Rhonda looked over at me with eyebrows raised. I pointed vaguely, expecting her to share in my horror.\n\nThis time, the tentacles unfolded from the windows of a large yellow house. I covered my eyes, and Rhonda said, \"Louise. It's just an art installation.\" I peered through my fingers as she told me that Andrew Anderson, a local artist, had created the pink kraken. I had to admit that the kraken looked kind of friendly up close.\n\nThe undersides of the soft, air-filled tentacles, were white-and-pink plaid. I could hear the unceasing buzz of the air blowers that, according to Rhonda, were responsible for making the inflatable sculpture seem alive. As we walked away, I felt a little silly. I made Rhonda promise not to tell our friends. And then I snuck one last peek at my summertime stalker and smiled.",

It was a massive machine that took up 1,800 square feet of floor space and weighed 30 tons.\n\nENIAC was designed during World War II with the intention of helping the US military calculate precise trajectory tables that would of allowed artillery to be adjusted quickly.\n\nA group of men designed and built ENIAC, a group of six women mathematicians, lead by Jean Jennings Bartik, programmed it. Bartik and her team figured out how to set ENIAC's 3,000 switches and hundreds of connection cables so that it could run each calculation correctly. Programming ENIAC required enormous patience. To change a program, the women had to rewire the machine manually by manipulating punch cards and switches in a series of wiring boards. It could take as long as two days to make even a small change.\n\nOnce Bartik's team finished a program, though, a complex calculation such that it would have taken a human several days to complete could be done by ENIAC in a fraction of a second. Therefore, the machine could instantly determine the cube root of 2,589 to the 16th power. In one second, ENIAC could discharge 5,000 additions, 357 multiplications, or 38 divisions.\n\nSuch computational capacity was used not only by the military but also in many scientific fields, including weather prediction, atomic energy research, and wind-tunnel design.\n\n[1] But all the media attention went to the machine itself and the men who designed it. [2] The introduction of ENIAC to the world in 1946 was headline news. [3] The women programmers were largely forgotten until the late 1980s, when Harvard student, Kathryn Kleiman, came across the women's names' in a computer-history book. [4] Kleiman filmed twenty hours of interviews with Bartik included with other surviving programmers. [5] This material finally brought attention to the ENIAC women, they were the twentieth century's first computer programmers.",

Howe received many prizes and accolades during his career. But a pivotal moment in 1958 led to his emergence as a key position responsible for broadening the boundaries of American Indian art.\n\n[2]\nIn 1958, Howe submitted a painting, Umine Wacipe: War and Peace Dance, to the Philbrook Art Center for consideration in the museum's annual competition showcasing art by American Indians. Representative of Howe's style at the time, the painting featured sharp, angular shapes in rich pink, blue, and purple hues that geometrically depicted five dancers. [A] The jurors for the competition rejected Howe's submission, claiming it was \"a fine painting ... but not Indian.\" The then widely held jurors shared the position that American Indian art should be based on the conventions of the Studio style. Works in this style depict traditional ceremonies, dance, and mythology and feature strong outlines and flat fields of color. [B] Howe's deviation from the style, in particular his use of certain techniques, was perceived to be the result of European influences, which the jurors considered incompatible with authentic American Indian art.\n\n[3]\nHowe displayed his work in more than sixty solo art shows. In an open letter, Howe argued that adhering and sticking to notions of tradition would suffocate innovation in American Indian art. Furthermore, he argued, his work did employ American Indian art conventions. The angular shapes in his painting, Howe noted, is actually derivative of the Dakota notion of tohokmu, the spider web.\n\n[4]\nThe Philbrook's jurors conceded; they expanded the scope of the competition to internalize experimental art. [C] Although questions related to art and identity are still on people's minds, Howe's efforts continue to inspire confidence in many artists who might otherwise feel confined by tradition. [D]",

[2] Technique, which includes tone and pitch, represent only fifty percent of their scoring criteria. [3] Still, qualifying for the IWC requires rigorous training. [4] Judges look for far more than a performer's ability to carry a tune. [5] Presentation and performance make up the rest, requiring judges to scrutinize participants' facial expressions, how participants present themselves overall onstage, and use of lips.\n\nParticipants can compete in both classical and popular musical categories. They might, nevertheless, whistle an entire movement from Beethoven's Fifth Symphony or a more modern selection from pop artist Beyoncé. Many returning participants ambitiously aim on top of their previous performances with even more complex pieces.\n\nCompetitors, however, are far from cutthroat. The global whistling community is a tight-knit family, and Louisburg its home. A 2012 documentary about the IWC captures these sentiments. Filmmaker, Ien Chi, a first-time whistling competitor himself, tells the story of a niche group of individuals from Japan, Korea, France, Israel, and elsewhere, whose mutual passion for whistling eclipses language barriers.\n\nOne US participant shared with Chi that he had waited thirty-four years to attend the world's premier whistling competition, and meet fellow whistlers. Others, acknowledging the outside perception of whistling as simply a quirky hobby, described their craft as an art form that fosters joy. Chi concludes that the IWC attracts people who are not just vying for medals; the convention also allows participants to communally celebrate this art form, year after year.",

        "introduction": "Adapted from the article \"Read My Lips\" by Chiara Barzini, published in Harper's Magazine.",
        "passage_text": "Filmmakers have debated the respective merits of subtitles and dubbing since the earliest sound films. In \"The Impossible Life of Clark Costa,\" published in 1940 in the film journal Cinema, director Michelangelo Antonioni wrote that Romolo Costa, the person who dubbed all of actor Clark Gable's performances, was a \"hybrid individual born out of a chemical combination.\" This \"half Clark, half Costa\" was unbearable to Antonioni, who considered dubbing to be a mere \"acoustic surrogate\" of acting. To him, dubbing compromised the intention of the director, leading to an artificial product that lacked artistic unity.\n\nDirector Pier Paolo Pasolini, who called both dubbing and subtitles \"evils,\" said that, between the two, dubbing was the less harmful, since it allowed you to see the picture in full. Director Jean Renoir called dubbing a \"monstrosity, a challenge to human and divine laws.\"\n\nDirector Federico Fellini didn't agree with any of them. Dubbing was an extension of his shoots, a technique he would use to retouch and rewrite. He mercilessly dubbed over his actors, changing dialogue in postproduction, sometimes having worked without a script. (He reportedly instructed his actors to count aloud in front of the camera so that he could insert new dialogue afterward.) Renato Cortesi, a veteran Fellini dubber, told me that, during the filming of Amarcord (1973), he witnessed Fellini ask an old Neapolitan lady to tell him a sad story. Over footage of this woman recounting a tragic tale about her grandson, Fellini added a new sound track about war and hunger recorded by an actor from Emilia-Romagna, combining the vivid expressiveness of the South with his favorite northern accent.\n\nIf you visit a dubbing studio, the over-the-top zest of the actors is evident in everything from their melodramatic speech to their movements; standing in front of the microphone, they coil and twitch. I asked Cortesi whether this was a consequence of having to focus one's lifelong talent into the few centimeters between mouth and microphone, a kind of bodily rebellion to the condition of being heard but not seen, and he laughed. \"Of course it isn't easy to spend a life in the darkness, but this is hardly the reason why they twitch and turn! Dubbers are used to reciting while trying to re-create the bodily sensations of what they see on the screen before them. If there is running in the film, they will run on their feet. The moving,\" he explained, \"is the result of re-creating large movements in small spaces.\"\n\nThere are still few options for those seeking to watch subtitled, original-language films at a movie house in Italy. The Metropolitan cinema on Via del Corso closed recently after a long battle involving intellectuals, show-business people, and American tourists in Rome, to be replaced with a clothing store. Italians remain hooked on dubbing—perhaps because of simple affection. Familiar voices yield emotional attachment.\n\nFrancesco Vairano, a dubber and dubbing director known for adapting foreign films considered to be \"undubbable,\" such as the French box office hit Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis (\"Welcome to the Sticks,\" 2008), which relies on linguistic misunderstandings for much of its comedy, explained that actors become just as attached to their parts as audiences do. Vairano has been one of the few directors to break the habit of matching the same Italian dubber to a foreign actor for all his films, preferring instead to select the dubber according to the requirements of the role, and, he admits, he was hated by all the prima donna dubbers for this. \"If you take that actor away from them,\" he told me, \"they will insult you.\"\n\nIn 2007, I met dubber Luca Ward, who provided the voice of the narrator for a romantic comedy I co-wrote, Scusa ma Ti Chiamo Amore (\"Sorry but I Love You\"). What I didn't then know was that everyone Ward met wanted him to recite actor Samuel L. Jackson's Ezekiel 25:17 passage from the film Pulp Fiction, and that I should consider it an honor that he would offer a performance to a stranger. When he finally did recite the monologue, it was astonishing, every dramatic pause carefully timed and every word perfectly enunciated. I understood that, if anybody took Samuel L. Jackson away from Ward, it would have meant taking away a part of his soul; he was, as Antonioni would say, half Ward, half Jackson. Leaving the day's recording session, Ward told me he was off to have dinner with actress Meg Ryan, before raising an eyebrow and clarifying, \"With Meg Ryan's dubber... I am having dinner with Meg Ryan's voice.\"",

        "passage_text": "Passage A\n\nIf humans were truly at home under the light of the moon and stars, we would go in darkness happily, the midnight world as visible to us as it is to the vast number of nocturnal species on this planet. Instead, we are diurnal creatures, with eyes adapted to living in the sun's light. This is a basic evolutionary fact, even though most of us don't think of ourselves as diurnal beings any more than we think of ourselves as primates or mammals or Earthlings. Yet it's the only way to explain what we've done to the night: We've engineered it to receive us by filling it with light.\n\nThis kind of engineering is no different from damming a river. Its benefits come with consequences—called light pollution—whose effects scientists are only now beginning to study. Light pollution is largely the result of bad lighting design, which allows artificial light to shine outward and upward into the sky, where it's not wanted, instead of focusing it downward, where it is. Wherever human light spills into the natural world, some aspect of life—migration, reproduction, feeding—is affected, and not for the better.\n\nMost cities have never been darker, in the sense of having less exposure to natural darkness, and so today's children in urban areas are growing up largely blind to the stars and planets. We've become so used to the glow of light pollution that we may not even miss the darkness when it's gone. But the ecological and human health consequences of disrupting natural patterns of light and dark are real.\n\nPassage B\n\nI worry we are rapidly losing night's natural darkness before realizing its worth. For those of us living in cities and suburbs, it has been lost already. We have forgotten what real darkness is like. We have forgotten what we are missing.\n\nBut it's not too late. The  decision to keep our night skies dark is not some abstract scientific or environmental issue—this is about our human heritage, our quality of life, and our cultural connection to the universe. To see the Milky Way draped across the sky is to realize our place in the cosmos—it's our home galaxy, visible from the surface of our home planet.\n\nAstronomers divide darkness into categories. \"Truly dark sky\" means you can see the Milky Way in detail. But near cities, sky glow brightens the night, and the Milky Way becomes difficult or impossible to see. Studies show that two-thirds of Americans and Europeans no longer experience truly dark skies. More than 99 percent of people living in the United States and Europe experience light-polluted skies.\n\nWhat we lose when we lose darkness is hard to measure but easy to experience. Stand under a dark sky and look up. Give your eyes time to adjust—the cones and rods need time to become sensitive. After twenty minutes or so, the stars begin to emerge, more and more of them, until the sky is full. This is our natural birthright: a sky filled with stars and the arc of the Milky Way, our home in the universe made visible.",

        "introduction": "This passage is adapted from an article about glaciers and their role in Earth's climate system.",
        "passage_text": "Glaciers are massive bodies of ice that form over many years from compressed snow. They exist on every continent except Australia, though the vast majority of the world's ice is contained in the ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland. Despite their solid appearance, glaciers are constantly in motion, flowing slowly downhill under their own weight like rivers of ice.\n\nThe formation of a glacier begins when snow accumulates faster than it melts. Over time, the weight of new snow compresses the layers beneath it, squeezing out the air and transforming the snow into dense ice. This process can take decades or even centuries, depending on the climate and location. Once the ice becomes thick enough—typically about 100 feet—gravity causes it to begin flowing downhill.\n\nGlaciers play a crucial role in Earth's climate system and have a significant impact on global sea levels. They act as frozen reservoirs, storing approximately 69 percent of the world's fresh water. When glaciers grow, they lock up water that would otherwise be in the ocean, causing sea levels to drop. When they melt, they release this water back into the sea, causing sea levels to rise.\n\nScientists study glaciers to understand past climate conditions and to predict future changes. Ice cores drilled from glaciers contain layers of ice that correspond to different time periods, much like tree rings. By analyzing these layers, scientists can determine past temperatures, atmospheric composition, and even the presence of volcanic eruptions. Some ice cores contain records going back hundreds of thousands of years.\n\nIn recent decades, glaciers around the world have been retreating at an accelerating rate. Measurements show that glaciers in Alaska, Greenland, Asia, and the Alps are losing mass faster than they are gaining it. This retreat is primarily attributed to rising global temperatures caused by human activities. As glaciers melt, they contribute to sea level rise, which threatens coastal communities around the world.\n\nThe loss of glaciers also affects freshwater availability. In many regions, particularly in South America and Asia, glaciers feed rivers that provide water for millions of people. As these glaciers shrink, the rivers they feed may experience reduced flow, especially during dry seasons when glacier meltwater is most needed. This could lead to water shortages and conflicts over water resources.\n\nBeyond their practical importance, glaciers hold an aesthetic and cultural significance. They have inspired artists, writers, and explorers for centuries. The sight of a massive glacier calving—breaking off large chunks of ice into the sea—is both beautiful and sobering, a reminder of the power of natural forces and the changes happening to our planet.",

        "author": null,
        "source": null,
        "introduction": "",
        "passage_text": "Ocean acidification, often called \"the other CO₂ problem,\" occurs when carbon dioxide from the atmosphere dissolves in seawater, forming carbonic acid. As atmospheric CO₂ levels have increased due to human activities since the Industrial Revolution, the ocean has absorbed about 30% of this excess carbon dioxide. While this absorption has helped slow the rate of climate change by reducing the amount of CO₂ in the atmosphere, it has come at a cost to marine ecosystems.\n\nWhen CO₂ dissolves in seawater, it forms carbonic acid, which releases hydrogen ions and lowers the pH of the water. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the ocean's pH has dropped by approximately 0.1 units, from 8.2 to 8.1. While this may seem like a small change, the pH scale is logarithmic, meaning that this represents a 26% increase in acidity. Scientists predict that if current trends continue, ocean pH could drop by another 0.3-0.4 units by the end of this century.\n\nThe effects of ocean acidification are already being observed in marine ecosystems around the world. Many marine organisms, including corals, mollusks, and some plankton species, rely on calcium carbonate to build their shells and skeletons. As ocean pH decreases, it becomes more difficult for these organisms to extract the carbonate ions they need from seawater. This process, called calcification, becomes increasingly energy-intensive as acidity increases, forcing organisms to divert energy from other vital functions such as growth, reproduction, and immune response.\n\nCoral reefs are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification. These diverse ecosystems support approximately 25% of all marine species despite covering less than 1% of the ocean floor. As acidification progresses, corals struggle to maintain their calcium carbonate skeletons, and existing structures may even begin to dissolve. This weakens the reef structure and reduces its ability to provide habitat for the countless species that depend on coral reefs for shelter and food.\n\nThe impacts extend beyond individual organisms to entire food webs. Many species at the base of marine food chains, such as pteropods (tiny swimming snails), are showing signs of shell dissolution in increasingly acidic waters. These organisms serve as food for fish, seabirds, and marine mammals, so their decline could have cascading effects throughout ocean ecosystems.\n\nResearchers are working to understand how different species might adapt to changing ocean chemistry. Some organisms may develop greater tolerance to acidic conditions through natural selection, while others may be forced to migrate to areas with more favorable water chemistry. However, the rapid pace of change may outstrip the ability of many species to adapt, particularly those with slow reproduction rates or limited mobility.\n\nAddressing ocean acidification requires reducing global CO₂ emissions, as the ocean will continue to absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide as long as concentrations remain elevated. In the meantime, scientists and conservationists are exploring strategies to help marine ecosystems cope with changing conditions, including establishing marine protected areas in regions that may be more resilient to acidification and reducing other stressors such as pollution and overfishing that could compound the effects of changing ocean chemistry.",

        "introduction": null,
        "passage_text": "Passage A by Theodora Skipitares\n\nEven before I began using puppets in my performances in 1982, I had always felt connected to the Japanese Bunraku theatre. The structure of the Bunraku theatre as a series of three splits or fragments of the conventions of Western theatre (text, music, and puppet) seemed to me a new way to organize a performance. The puppet, along with the manipulator, was a separate entity, and so was the narrator, as was the musician (the latter two on a platform to one side). Bunraku presented a total, though divided, spectacle. One's focus could go back and forth between the manipulator or the puppet, the manipulation or the resulting gesture. Japanese puppet drama developed at a rapid pace in the 1700s. Male puppeteers were hidden from the public by a curtain while they held (one-man) puppets, about two feet tall, above their heads. The narrator and musician were also hidden. In 1703, a group of puppeteers created a sensation when they appeared in full view of the audience, separated only by a translucent curtain. The curtain itself was eliminated two years later. In 1728, the narrator and musician were given their own auxiliary stage, the yuka. Since then, one unusual feature of the Japanese puppet theatre is that the manipulator makes no attempt to conceal the fact that he is manipulating the puppets. Unlike puppet performances from other countries, this Japanese form does not require the illusion that the puppets are moving and talking on their own. In 1983, I began to use a modified Bunraku performance style for certain life-size human figures. I spent plenty of time trying to make them super-realistic, so that their skin looked lifelike, their eyes blinked \"naturally,\" and their hands could actually grab objects. What I didn't understand then about Bunraku theatre was that its greatness lay in the constant tension, and the attempt to strike a balance between realism and nonrealism. Bunraku was not trying to persuade the audience it was watching reality, rather than a play. And I was very much interested in creating a flat surface of reality. Looking back, I feel that I was barely exploring the full potential of the Japanese form.\n\nPassage B by Joan Acocella\n\nJapanese puppetry takes its great power from the fact that it is very realistic and very artificial at the same time. As was proved again by the Awaji Puppet Theatre Company's recent season at Japan Society, what strikes you first is the realism. The puppeteers seem to have spent five centuries (that is the genre's estimated age, at minimum) working out the precise rhythm with which a weeping woman would dab her eyes with her sleeve. The lifelikeness is indeed a thrill. But the reason that we can enjoy the realism is that in other respects, most respects, these figures are not at all like us. The Awaji puppets are about three feet tall, to start with. Furthermore, to get around, they need three men, with rods and springs, manipulating them. The puppeteers are clothed and masked in black, but that doesn't mean that we don't see them. All this, maybe, we could shut out, and enter fully into the illusion, but there is another thing stopping us: the fixity of the puppets' faces. Awaji dramas, like their Bunraku counterparts, often concern the furthest outdistricts of human emotion. In one of the offerings at Japan Society, \"Hidakagawa Iriai Zakura\" (1759), a woman becomes so jealous that she turns into a green sea monster. Such dramatic events are preceded by long, histrionic speeches, but, as the characters deliver their orations, their faces, eerily, do not move. The emotion is displaced from the face and thereby gains in subtlety and force. As for the characters' words, those, too, are displaced—to a chanter. This person, considered the star of the puppetry team, sits to the side of the stage, where he tells the story and, when necessary, speaks the dialogue. The crux, however, is not the words but the singing. The chanter sobs; he gasps; he calls on Heaven to witness his grief. (And he does so in male and female, old and young, high-status and low-status voices.) When the woman in \"Hidakagawa\" describes her jealousy, the chanter runs the gamut of vocal expressiveness: head notes and belly notes, squeals and grunts, trills and runs without end. Meanwhile, the lady for whom he is speaking stands there with an unmoving face, white and lustrous, like a pearl. We seem, here, to get everything that art can give: the abstemious and the unleashed, the Gothic and the Baroque. The logic is not logical; it is lyrical, musical.",

        "passage_text": "When my family first moved to the United States, my father was still traveling back and forth to Iran before joining us permanently. After one trip, he brought with him a small collection of Iranian children's books. These books, along with numerous others, were created under the Kanoon Parvaresh Fekri Koodakan va Nojavanan (Institute for the Intellectual Development of Children and Adolescents). To me, its iconic stylized rooster logo conveyed a positive and bright outlook for the betterment of children. In 1961, the Kanoon was established to enhance the quality and educational standards of children's literature and activities. A large part of the program was devoted to the publishing of high-quality, richly written and illustrated books for children and adolescents.\n\nI have six books from that era. They were loaded with cultural and historical references and set apart from each other and from my American children's books in their individual and unique styles of illustration.\n\nIn times where I felt the most disconnected, the most doubtful of my identity, I would turn to these books, get lost in them, in the fantasy of them. They were my one connection to the culture I left behind. In them I found some remnant of my past life. I would open a book and feel like I was \"home\" again. I see now how the seeds to express my thoughts and ideas through pictures were sown. Out of the endearing times I spent with my little collection sprung the desire to illustrate books, to use calligraphy and hand-written text. This was my introduction to art and words living together and there's a little from each book in some aspect of my work, my own children's book.\n\nMy favorite of the collection is called Marmoolak Koochak Otagheh Man (My Room's Little Lizard) by Farshid Mesqali. Its surrealistic watercolors draw you into the realm of dreams. The hand lettering of the book's title and the deep black, blues, greens and purples that bleed softly into one another, making up the body of the lizard, were so beguiling to me. They still are. I see the influence in my own work. Baba Barfi was another, done in gorgeous hues of blue and greys, in a mix of drawing and watercolor. There is a quiet simplicity in the illustrations and the story that reminds me of the silence right after snowfall.\n\nAbout 12 years ago, my mother visited Iran and brought back with her another set of children's books. These happened to be illustrated by an important figure from my childhood: Gholamali Maktabi, someone I hadn't thought of in years. I never until now got the message of the giving of all these books, first by my father and again by my mother. I had tucked Maktabi's wonderful books away in my memory all of these years and not until the idea for this essay presented itself, did I bring them out into the light. And he came out along with them.\n\nGholamali Maktabi was my father's dear and lifelong friend from their school days. He was a part of our family and we endearingly called him \"Dhayee Maktabi,\" which means Uncle Maktabi in Farsi. I remember a sense of warmth always surrounding that name. I knew him first as the person behind the poignant, sensitive photographs taken of us in Iran as we were growing up. The images he recorded have served time and again as windows into my childhood, my personality as a child, images that connect me with who I was. His innate ability to capture with such simplicity and affection the smile or frown of a child can also be seen in his lifework as an illustrator of children's books. Dhayee Maktabi would spend time drawing with my sister and me when we were children.\n\nIn October 2007, after more than 30 years, I called Dhayee Maktabi. No time, it felt, had gone by. \"I was drawn from a young age to painting,\" Maktabi remembers. \"This interest ultimately led to my desire to become an illustrator and slowly began to replace painting for me—though to this day I still have a special love for drawing and painting. I've spent about forty years illustrating children's and adolescents' books and I expect that I will continue to do this for the foreseeable future. The thing that has always attracted me to illustrating for children and adolescents is the world that they inhabit, one which is full of mysteries and secrets.\"\n\nIndeed, I believe that those photographic portraits of my family done long ago also served this purpose. My mother told me recently that Maktabi loved to just sit and observe us, our games and antics, our \"secret worlds\" that, through the small window of his shutter, were lovingly revealed.",

        "passage_text": "The Mississippi River batture is unique. Here we have a place that is neither water nor land; it is both. It depends on the time of year. Spanish and French traditions going back to the time of Rome recognized public rights to public things. The civil code declared that rivers and their banks were public, which would have closed the matter. But in the late 1700s along came Edward Livingston, a New Yorker with an American notion of private property, a keen legal mind, a nose for money, and an ambition as big as the Ritz.\n\nLivingston's accomplishments in the courthouse and the legislature remain monuments today, but the case that made him famous was about dirt on the banks of the Mississippi at a prime location in downtown New Orleans. Livingston and his client who claimed the dirt stood to make a fortune. Indeed, Livingston declined a fee in the case. Instead, if he won he would get a piece of the victory, the most valuable real estate in New Orleans.\n\nThe American notion of property was not popular in New Orleans, whose people were accustomed to using the banks of rivers to beach their boats, promenade, fish, swim, rake mussels, and even take fill for their front yards. By precedent rising from centuries, the Mississippi batture was common ground. In a city oppressed by heat, the batture was also treasured ground, the place where everyone in society from cotton brokers to boat hands could enjoy the breeze, air pleasant to inhale, and the very sight of the river. When Livingston's client undertook to develop the batture he was claiming, a public mob arrived to interrupt his work. Every day.\n\nLivingston's client made a frontal assault. He went out at low water, diked off the batture, and then arrested people coming to take the river sand in the old and accustomed way. The ensuing lawsuits rivaled the twists and turns of a Dickens novel. On one side was Livingston, claiming that private property was sacred in America. On the other was a who's who of wellborn local names right on up to the president of the United States. Thomas Jefferson considered the public character of the Mississippi to be a civic right and essential to his ambitions for settling the West. After Livingston won his first case, Jefferson had U.S. marshals evict him from the batture anyway, at which point Livingston sued the officer who evicted him. It got that bad.\n\nWhen the dust settled, years later, Livingston emerged with his property deed, but he had ceded important claims to the city, including part of his real estate and development controls on the rest. Compromise that it was, the New Orleans batture would go from small wharves and open space to an impressive accumulation of mega-wharves and warehouses. New Orleaneans not only could no longer access the river; they could no longer even see it.\n\nEnter Robert Livingston, Edward's brother, with an even more impressive list of accomplishments and a yet bigger coup in mind. He and Robert Fulton, who had either invented the steamboat or made a quick copy of someone else's, depending on your source, tendered an offer to New Orleans that it could not refuse, a monopoly on the Mississippi River.\n\nFulton's steamboat had one huge advantage for the future of the city; it could go upriver. The early flatboats didn't even try. Fulton's new boat could get back up in a week, although he had not exactly done it yet. The Fulton-Livingston team proposed a deal. They would deliver steamboat commerce to New Orleans, if the city would grant them all rights to the river trade. They would own the river.\n\nEnter another challenger. Henry Shreve came from the Red River in northwestern Louisiana and saw Livingston's monopoly as a threat to the future of his region. He built his own steamship, sailed it down to New Orleans, loaded it with goods, and sailed back home again to a hero's welcome. People did that sort of thing back then. Fulton had only talked about going back upriver. Now Shreve had actually done it, and with merchandise on board. More threatening, Shreve tried it again. Livingston had to make his move, and so, as the second Shreve boat was ready to leave New Orleans with its cargo, he had the captain and the boat arrested.\n\nThe public sided against the Livingstons, as it had on the batture cases earlier, causing a small riot. Shreve was released the next day. A few months later a local judge dismissed the lawsuit. Edward Livingston might own a piece of the batture, but Robert would not own the river.",

        "passage_text": "Passage A by Alex Ross\n\nOn August 29, 1952, David Tudor walked onto the stage of the Maverick Concert Hall, near Woodstock, New York, sat down at the piano, and, for four and a half minutes, made no sound. He was performing \"4'33\",\" a conceptual work by John Cage. It has been called the \"silent piece,\" but its purpose is to make people listen. \"There's no such thing as silence,\" Cage said, recalling the premiere. \"You could hear the wind stirring outside during the first movement. During the second, raindrops began pattering the roof, and during the third people themselves made all kinds of interesting sounds as they talked or walked out.\"\n\nComposer and scholar Kyle Gann defines \"4'33\"\" as \"an act of framing, of enclosing environmental and unintended sounds in a moment of attention in order to open the mind to the fact that all sounds are music.\" That last thought ruled Cage's life: he wanted to discard inherited structures, open doors to the exterior world, \"let sounds be just sounds.\" Gann writes, \"It begged for a new approach to listening, perhaps even a new understanding of music itself, a blurring of the conventional boundaries between art and life.\"\n\nOn a simpler level, Cage had an itch to try new things. What would happen if you sat at a piano and did nothing? If you chose among an array of musical possibilities by flipping a coin and consulting the I Ching? If you made music from junkyard percussion, squads of radios, the scratching of pens, an amplified cactus?\n\nMany people, of course, won't hear of it. Nearly six decades after the work came into the world, \"4'33\"\" is still dismissed as \"absolutely ridiculous,\" \"stupid,\" and \"a gimmick.\" Such judgments are especially common within classical music where Cage, who died in 1992, remains an object of widespread scorn.\n\nMorton Feldman, another avant-garde musician, once said, \"John Cage was the first composer in the history of music who raised the question by implication that maybe music could be an art form rather than a musical form.\" Feldman meant that, since the Middle Ages, even the most adventurous composers had labored within a craftsmanlike tradition. Cage held that an artist can work as freely with sound as with paint: he changed what it meant to be a composer, and every kid manipulating music on a laptop is in his debt. Not everything he did was laudable, or even tolerable. Yet the work remains inescapable, mesmerizing, and often unexpectedly touching. It encompasses some of the most violent sounds of the twentieth century, as well as some of the most gently beguiling. It confronts us with the elemental question of what music is, and confounds all easy answers.\n\nPassage B by Daniel J. Levitin\n\nThe music of many avant-garde composers stretches the bounds of what most of us think music is. Going beyond the use of melody and harmony, and even beyond the use of instruments, these composers use recordings of found objects in the world such as jackhammers, trains, and waterfalls. They edit the recordings, play with their pitch, and ultimately combine them into an organized collage of sound with the same type of emotional trajectory—the same tension and release—as traditional music. Composers in this tradition are like the painters who stepped outside the boundaries of representational and realistic art—the cubists, the Dadaists, many of the modern painters from Picasso to Kandinsky.\n\nWhat do the music of Bach and John Cage fundamentally have in common? On the most basic level, what distinguishes Busta Rhymes's \"What's It Gonna Be?!\" or Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata from, say, the collection of sounds you'd hear standing in the middle of Times Square or those you'd hear deep in a rainforest? As the composer Edgard Varése famously defined it, \"Music is organized sound.\"\n\nIt is helpful to examine what music is made of. What are the fundamental building blocks of music? And how, when organized, do they give rise to music? The basic elements of any sound are loudness, pitch, contour, duration (or rhythm), tempo, timbre, spatial location, and reverberation. Our brains organize these fundamental perceptual attributes into higher-level concepts—just as a painter arranges lines into forms. When we listen to music, we are actually perceiving multiple attributes.\n\nEach attribute can be varied without altering the others. The difference between music and a random or disordered set of sounds has to do with the way these fundamental attributes combine, and the relations that form between them.",

        "passage_text": "A few years ago it was extremely difficult for scientists to trace our species' genetic responses to our environment; the needed tools just did not exist. All that changed with the completion of the human genome sequence and the subsequent cataloguing of genetic variation. To understand exactly what we did, it helps to know a bit about how DNA is structured and how small changes can affect its function. The human genome sequence consists of about three billion pairs of DNA nucleotides, or \"letters,\" that serve as an instruction manual for how to assemble a human. The manual is now known to contain a parts list of about 20,000 genes—strings of DNA letters that spell out the information required to build proteins. (Proteins, which include enzymes, do much of the work in cells.) About 2 percent of the human genome encodes proteins, and a roughly similar amount seems to be involved in gene regulation. Most of the rest of the genome has no known role.\n\nOverall the genomes of any two people are extremely similar, differing in only about one out of every 1,000 nucleotide pairs. Sites where one nucleotide pair substitutes for another are referred to as single-nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs (pronounced \"snips\"), and the alternative versions of the DNA at each SNP are called alleles. Because most of the genome does not encode proteins or regulate genes, most SNPs probably have no measurable effect on the individual. But if a SNP occurs in a region of the genome that does have a coding or regulating function, it may affect the structure or function of a protein or where and how much of the protein is made. In this way, SNPs can conceivably modify almost any trait, be it height, eye color, ability to digest milk, or susceptibility to diseases.\n\nWhen natural selection strongly favors a particular allele, it becomes more common in the population with each generation, while the disfavored allele becomes less common. Eventually, if the environment remains stable, the beneficial allele will spread until everyone in the population carries it, at which point it has become fixed in that group. This process typically takes many generations. In theory, a helpful allele could become fixed in as little as a few hundred years if it conferred an extraordinarily large advantage. Conversely, a less advantageous allele could take many thousands of years to spread.\n\nIt would be great if in our efforts to understand recent human evolution, we could obtain DNA samples from ancient remains and actually track the changes of favored alleles over time. But DNA usually degrades quickly in ancient samples, thereby hindering this approach. Research groups around the world have developed methods of examining genetic variation in modern-day humans for signs of natural selection that has happened in the past.\n\nOne such tactic is to comb DNA data from many different people for stretches that show few differences in SNP alleles within a population. The spread of selected alleles by natural selection can leave distinctive patterns in the SNP data: if an existing allele suddenly proves particularly helpful when a population finds itself in new circumstances, that allele can reach high frequency (while remaining rare in other populations).\n\nOver the past few years multiple studies have identified several hundred genome signals of apparent natural selection that occurred within the past 60,000 years or so. In a few of these cases, scientists have a pretty good grasp on the selective pressures and the adaptive benefit of the favored allele. For example, among dairy-farming populations in Europe, the Middle East and East Africa, the region of the genome that houses the gene for the lactase enzyme that digests lactose (the sugar in milk) shows clear signs of having been the target of strong selection. In most populations, babies are born with the ability to digest lactose, but the lactase gene turns off after weaning, leaving people unable to digest lactose as adults. Writing in the American Journal of Human Genetics in 2004, a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimated that variants of the lactase gene that remain active into adulthood achieved high frequency in European dairy-farming groups in just 5,000 to 10,000 years. In 2006 a group led by Sarah Tishkoff, who is now at the University of Pennsylvania, reported in Nature Genetics that they had found rapid evolution of the lactase gene in East African dairy-farming populations. These changes were surely an adaptive response to a new subsistence practice.",

Theirs was an auspicious meeting, although no one had troubled to check the alignment of the stars; the young woman was twenty-seven—old for a prospective bride—but she was studying for a master's degree in chemistry.\n\nHe took her home. She boarded with a family in Brooklyn. During the car ride they were silent. It was a strange and comfortable silence for two people who had waited for so long to be alone. The thrum of the motor was loud because the car was old. When they turned the corner he pulled over. \"Here,\" he said. And having delivered her he waited in the car until she had opened the door and gone inside.\n\nThe space they inhabited, their New York, had a gentle anonymity. They moved through it like two needles through silk, barely disturbing its fabric. And when they stopped for tea or talked while sitting on a park bench, they were unremarkable. No one knew them. No one looked twice at a young Tamil couple. They could have been anybody. In the evenings he dropped her off at her lodgings and said good-bye. After the door closed behind them the space between their rooms—his apartment on the other side of the city—felt very wide. They talked on the telephone. They went to dinner. They fell in love.\n\nThey married. The wedding was small and quick. They sent wedding announcements home. The photographs that accompanied the announcements were formal. In them she is dressed in a silk sari, he in a suit. They are standing very straight, and there is space between them, which was how it was supposed to be. They are looking away from each other and into the camera. But in one photograph, slipped in with the more proper ones sent home, they are looking at each other and laughing. This was their secret.\n\nAfter they married, they moved to a new apartment. It was in a tall building, and from their window they could see other buildings, the city spread below them in lights. At night the view made my mother think of stars, and she would stand by the window, looking down at all those lights and thinking of their distance from home. My father was proud of the apartment. He was proud of the furniture they had bought, the dishes they ate from, the life they were making.\n\nOne day my mother announced that she was pregnant. My father received this news with joy. He had been preparing for it. He had been saving money, making plans, imagining a future. This child—me—would be American. I would be born here and would belong in a way that my parents, who had come here as adults, never quite could. I would be part of this place. That was what they wanted.",

        "passage_text": "I have always been fascinated by the way we remember places. When I think of my childhood home, I don't see it as it actually was—I see fragments, pieces of rooms, the way light fell through a particular window, the sound of the furnace clicking on in winter. My memories are a patchwork, incomplete but somehow more meaningful than a perfect reproduction could ever be.\n\nThis is what drew me to photography. A photograph can capture a moment, freeze it in time, but it can never capture the fullness of experience. It can't capture the smell of pine trees on a summer day, the feeling of cold water on your feet, the way your heart races when you're standing at the edge of a cliff. These things exist in memory, not in images.\n\nBut photographs do something else: they shape our memories. Once you've taken a photograph of a place, that image becomes part of how you remember it. The photograph replaces the memory, or at least influences it. You remember the composition, the frame, what was included and what was left out. In this way, photographs are both documents of experience and filters through which we reconstruct the past.\n\nIn my work, I'm interested in exploring this relationship between place, photography, and memory. I create images that are deliberately incomplete, that suggest rather than describe. I want viewers to fill in the gaps with their own memories, their own experiences of place. A photograph of a forest might show only fragments—shafts of light, the texture of bark, shadows on the ground. The viewer has to assemble these pieces into something coherent, just as we assemble our memories from fragments.\n\nThis approach is rooted in the understanding that memory is inherently subjective and personal. No two people remember the same event or place in exactly the same way. Our memories are colored by our emotions, our past experiences, our expectations. They change over time, growing more vivid or fading away entirely. They are unreliable narrators of our own lives.\n\nPhotography, despite its reputation for objectivity, is equally subjective. Every photograph is shaped by countless decisions: where to stand, what to include in the frame, when to press the shutter, how to process the image afterward. These decisions reflect the photographer's perspective, their interpretation of the scene. In this sense, a photograph is never just a document—it's an argument, a point of view.\n\nWhat interests me most is the space between the photograph and the memory, between what the image shows and what it suggests. This space is where meaning is made, where the viewer brings their own experience to bear on what they see. It's an active process, a collaboration between artist and audience. The photograph is not complete until someone looks at it and completes it with their own memories, their own understanding of place.",

I like to share her stories with other people and chatter away when I am able to command adult attention.\n\n\"She left the reservation when she was sixteen years old,\" I tell my audience. Sixteen sounds very old to me, but I always state the number because it seems integral to my recitation. \"She had never been on a train before or used a telephone. She left Standing Rock to take a job in Chicago so she could help out the family during the War. She was so petrified of the new surroundings, she stayed in her seat all the way from McLaughlin, South Dakota, to Chicago, Illinois, and didn't move once.\" I usually laugh after saying this because I cannot imagine my mother being afraid of anything. She is so tall, a true Dakota woman; she rises against the sun like a skyscraper, and when I draw her picture in my notebook, she takes up the entire page. She talks politics and attends sit-ins and says what's on her mind. I am her small shadow and witness. I am the timid daughter who can rage only on paper.\n\nWe don't have much money, but Mom takes me from one end of the city to the other, on foot, on buses. I will grow up believing that Chicago belongs to me, because it was given to me by my mother.\n\nSome days we haunt the Art Institute, and my mother pauses before a Picasso. \"He did this during his blue period,\" she tells me. I squint at the blue man holding a blue guitar. \"Was he very sad?\" I ask.\n\n\"Yes, I think he was.\" My mother takes my hand and looks away from the painting. I can see a story developing behind her eyes, and I tug on her arm to release the words. She will tell me why Picasso was blue, what his thoughts were as he painted this canvas. She relates anecdotes I will never find in books, never see footnoted in a biography of the master artist. I don't even bother to check these references, because I like my mother's version best.\n\nPassage B by Leslie Chang\n\nWater belongs to everyone and to no one. For this reason, I have always had a particular affinity for it, which may strike some as mysterious. Westerners ask me where my parents were born, as though the answer will enable them to glean some knowledge. The answer is Beijing and Luoyang. The truth is that this response signifies nothing. The meaningful question would be to ask where my ancestors lived. The answer to that is inland. My father's people came from Wuhan, birthplace of the Chinese republic and the capital of Hubei, that sweltering province sandwiched between Sichuan and Anhui. My mother's father was from Inner Mongolia, land of desert and grassy plains.\n\nYet water calls to me. I remain convinced that I would find peace if I could only have a house by the ocean. I insisted on being married near the sea. This bond, I know, comes from my mother. She longs for a view more than anything else. Once, staying at a hotel in San Francisco, she insisted on seeing three different rooms before she found one with which she was satisfied. It was on a floor so high it made me dizzy, with a corner window overlooking the bay. Even so, my mother spent most of her time on the bridge linking the elevator bank to our wing. The bridge consisted almost entirely of windows. It offered a view in either direction that was brilliant and blinding. If there had been a chair, she could have sat forever, letting the gold sun and blue sea overwhelm her through the glass.\n\nMy mother may have descended from inland people, but they were also nomads. Her father rode his horse practically the length of China, from Inner Mongolia to Guangzhou, a distance of some twelve hundred miles. My mother could only become a nomad herself—forever moving, yet always retaining some essential part of her being, all the places she has been. In this, she is like water, not dead water but fearlessly changing and going, recognizable and intact in spite of its shimmering. When she gazes out on its expanse, she sees her own reflection. When I gaze, I see her, my mother, always pulling away, returning and pulling away again. I drink from her, and she slips between my fingertips. She has borne me all this way. I cannot decide whether I want her to stay or go. When she is here, I wish she would leave. When she is gone, I wish she would return. She pulls away again, a force as elemental as the ebbing tide. I remain a child on the shore, eagerly collecting the sea glass and driftwood.",

        "passage_text": "When the first comprehensive report on the ice industry of the United States was commissioned in 1879 as part of a national census, it was estimated that about eight million tons were harvested annually, though the business was so extensive and production so poorly documented that this was, at best, a well-informed guess. The figures were put together by one Henry Hall, who signed himself \"special agent\" and gave an account of the great growth of the industry in the preceding ten years. Of the eight million tons of ice harvested, about five million reached the consumer—the rest melted during shipment and storage. By far the biggest market was in New York, and none of its ice was manufactured artificially: it was all cut in winter and stored in hundreds of timber warehouses that lined the lakes and rivers and had a capacity of up to fifty thousand tons each.\n\nBetween New York and Albany, 150 miles up the Hudson River, there were 135 icehouses, but even this was not enough to supply the metropolis, which relied heavily on imports. In fact, in the year of the great ice census, New York and Philadelphia suffered one of their recurrent ice \"famines,\" when unseasonably warm weather destroyed the harvest on the Hudson and local lakes, and the price of ice rose from $4 to $5 a ton. That year the ice was fifteen to twenty inches thick in Maine, a top-quality crop, and it could be shipped down to New York at an estimated cost of $1.50 a ton. This produced a frenzy of harvesting on the Kennebec, Penobscot, and Sheepscot Rivers, and two thousand cargoes of ice packed in hay and sawdust were shipped south to New York, Philadelphia, and other more southern cities, where they were sold for a total of around $1.5 million.\n\nThough the demand for ice rose annually, the New York suppliers did not explore the use of artificial refrigeration. Instead, they began to buy up sections of the Kennebec River shoreline and to erect great wooden warehouses there, transforming the landscape of the river for many miles. It was the same farther inland, where ice companies bought up shoreline along the lakes and put up storehouses to supply the meat industry of Chicago and the brewers of Milwaukee, as well as millions of domestic consumers.\n\nThe first real crisis in the natural-ice trade was caused not by competition from artificial manufacture, but by pollution. As the cities grew, they encroached on the rivers and lakes from which the ice was cut, and soon there were health scares. This produced a search for cleaner supplies farther away from towns, and stimulated the search for a means of manufacturing ice with pure water. The realization that the bacteria that cause diseases such as typhoid were not killed off in frozen water added to the urgency of finding safer forms of refrigeration.\n\nThe natural-ice trade began to decline from the early decades of the twentieth century, though in more remote areas of North America where electric power was not available but lake ice was abundant in winter, it survived as late as the 1950s. As ice harvesting died out, the evidence of its former vast scale rapidly disappeared. There was no alternative use for the great icehouses, many of which simply burned down, often set alight by a spark from a steam train—they were surprisingly flammable, as most were made of wood and kept as dry as possible to better preserve the blocks of ice they housed. But the majority were demolished or simply rotted away.\n\nOver a wide area of the northern states, young diving enthusiasts with no knowledge of the former ice trade still emerge from lakes and rivers clutching an impressive variety of odd implements—plows and chisels and scrapers that fell through the ice during the harvesting. One or two museums keep small displays of these tools, and collectors have preserved manufacturers' catalogs that proudly present their versions of the ice plow, the ice saw, the grapple, the jack grapple, the breaking-off bar, the caulk bar, the packing chisel, the house bar, the fork bar, the float hook, the line marker, and many other specialist implements the use of which has long been forgotten.\n\nThe inner-city icehouses have also gone, and the ice wagon and the iceman are rapidly fading memories. All that is left in America of this once-great industry is the water itself, which provided a continuously renewable supply of ice each winter. There are few memorials on the banks of the rivers and lakes that once produced such a vital crop.",

        "passage_text": "Scientists have long puzzled over the enormous size of the human brain. It is seven times larger than one would predict for an average mammal of our size. Many of our extra neurons are in a region of the brain called the frontal cortex, where much of the most sophisticated thought takes place.\n\nTo understand how we ended up with such a strange organ, many scientists have turned to our fellow primates. They also have large brains, although not as large as our own. It turns out that primates with a big frontal cortex tend to live in large groups.\n\nPrimates may be pushed into larger groups thanks to predators or to patchy sources of food like fruit trees. As their numbers grow, natural selection may favor social intelligence. The primates form long-term alliances with each other and compete with rivals. They begin to keep track of a larger and larger social network.\n\nA boost in social intelligence can lead to an evolutionary edge for primates. Well-connected female baboons, for example, dominate their bands. They have more babies than lower-ranking females, and their babies enjoy better health and faster growth.\n\nBrain imaging studies have revealed that when people think about other people, parts of the frontal cortex become active. Advocates of the social brain hypothesis say the frontal cortex expanded in our ancestors because natural selection favored social intelligence.\n\nMost of the research on the social brain hypothesis has focused on primates. One reason for that bias, Dr. Kaye Holekamp, a professor at Michigan State University, said, is many scientists thought that no other animals were worth studying. \"Primatologists have argued for years,\" she said, \"that primates are unique in terms of the complexity of their social lives.\"\n\nFrom her experience with hyenas, Dr. Holekamp had her doubts. So she began to run experiments on spotted hyenas similar to the ones run on primates. She would play recordings of hyenas, for example, to see if other hyenas recognized them individually. They did. She soon came to see the primates-only view of the social brain as deeply flawed.\n\nTo understand the social intelligence of hyenas, Dr. Holekamp and her colleagues track the animals from birth to death. Their work begins in the communal dens where the cubs live for their first few months. Older spotted hyenas pay regular visits to the dens, giving the cubs an opportunity to learn about the rigid hierarchy in which they live. Spotted hyena societies have one dominant female at the top, and a series of hyenas below her. Each cub learns exactly where it fits into the hierarchy, and where all the other spotted hyenas fit as well.\n\nThe hierarchy reveals itself most vividly when it is time to eat. When one or two hyenas make a kill, other members of the clan will join them to fight over the prey. But the dominant female always wins.\n\nThere are times, however, when the entire group of hyenas comes together. Spotted hyena clans patrol the borders of their territory together. \"When the whole group territory is on the line,\" Dr. Holekamp said, \"all these unrelated individuals join forces and engage in a clan war.\"\n\nWhat makes the social complexity of spotted hyenas particularly enlightening, Dr. Holekamp said, are their relatives. They belong to a family of four species, and the other three live in strikingly different societies. Dr. Holekamp wonders if this range of social arrangements is reflected in the structure of hyena brains.\n\nFrom a CT-scan of a hyena skull, it is possible to reconstruct the three-dimension structure of the brain it held. Dr. Holekamp and her colleagues have been working to survey dozens of skulls from all four species in the hyena family. Their preliminary results indicate hyenas follow the same rules as primates.\n\n\"It's just what the social complexity hypothesis would predict,\" Dr. Holekamp said. \"The hyenas with the simplest social systems have the tiniest frontal cortices. The spotted hyena, which lives in the most complex societies, has far and away the largest frontal cortex.\"\n\nJoan Silk, an expert on monkey societies at the University of California, Los Angeles, praises Dr. Holekamp's research, calling it \"directly relevant to our understanding of the origins of social complexity and intelligence.\"\n\n\"I would argue that's not true at all: spotted hyenas live in a society just as large and just as complex as baboons',\" Dr. Holekamp said, noting that spotted hyenas live in the largest social groups of any carnivore. \"We're talking about 60 to 80 individuals who all know each other individually.\"",

        "passage_text": "I am in the living room of apartment 6C in the Samuel J. Tilden housing projects in Brownsville, Brooklyn. It is 1960. I am four. I stand on my tiptoes in my stocking feet. My small brown fingers clutch the edge of a Motorola high-fidelity stereo, which is made of shiny lacquered wood and has a lemony smell, from the polish my mother applies every Saturday afternoon.\n\nI feel the bass speakers in my stomach. I smell the polish. I feel the music. Looking over the edge, down into the bowels of the hi-fi, I watch the turntable needle roll across the grooves of a seven-inch record with a blue-and-white label at 45 revolutions per minute. The song is \"Please Mr. Postman\" by the Marvelettes.\n\nAs much as I enjoy \"Please Mr. Postman,\" I'm anxious to hear the next record. Not just because it's Roy Orbison's \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" (which is the first record I ever asked my mother to buy for me), but because above \"Mr. Postman\" on the turntable are a slew of seven-inch singles suspended around a fat brown cylinder. Once \"Please Mr. Postman\" finishes, the needle arm moves away, a single vinyl 45 plops down on the turntable, and the needle returns, catching the groove and sending the rhythm of \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" vibrating through my body.\n\nThis Motorola stereo was the centerpiece of my family's living room, and our social life. Ma didn't allow my little sister, Andrea, or me in our living room too often, because she didn't want us sitting on her plastic-covered sofa or fingering the dice-shaped lighter on her glass-and-wood living-room table. But if we were playing records in the early evenings or on weekends, it was okay.\n\nAll through my childhood, from my first consciousness of music into the early seventies, that Motorola was my passport, not simply to records, but to the vast nation outside New York that the music came from. While the black-and-red labels of Atlantic 45s carried a Broadway address, most of the records in her collection came from Memphis (the Stax Records label was pale blue, with a finger-snapping logo) or Detroit (Motown's black-and-white label had a red star for the Motor City, while Tamla's colors were yellow and brown). As I read the labels of the records Ma brought home, I slowly became familiar with the cities of soul—Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Cincinnati. By the time I was an adolescent, I could identify certain names that recurred in the credits. Way before I understood what these credits meant, or who these people were, I was already collecting info for the books and articles I had no idea I would eventually write.\n\nMy interest in these records stemmed from a desire to better understand my mother's life. My mother was a soul girl: petite and cute, with a bright, girlish smile. Arizona Bacchus George, aka Doll, aka Ma, was full of life, and loved to laugh. Though burdened with raising two kids alone in a Brooklyn housing project, she didn't allow herself to become a stranger to fun. Not only was her ever-growing stack of 45s a testament to her love of music and dance, but she regularly held parties in that sacrosanct living room for her girlfriends and their male admirers.\n\nI remember the time we took a pilgrimage to the Apollo Theater for a matinee show. It was a chilly, overcast day, and my mother and I joined a long line of black folk, as far as I could see, huddled on 125th Street, awaiting entry. Once inside, we sat in the orchestra near the back. I remember the elements of the James Brown Revue quite distinctly: Pigmeat Markham did his famous \"Here Comes the Judge\" routine; the Fabulous Flames danced like demons and harmonized like choir boys; the J.B.s, behind the antic introduction of MC Danny Ray, banged out a medley of the great man's hits.\n\nThen Brown himself appeared, a short, dark man with shiny, processed hair who whirled and shuddered and shouted. On the way back to Brooklyn on the A train, I babbled to my mother about the sweaty man who kept tossing the cape off his back and running back to the mike to wail, \"Please! Please! Please!\"\n\nIt was special for me, not only because I'd seen James Brown, but because I was too young for so many of the shows my mother attended. Unlike today, when the separation between adult and kid entertainment has been blurred to the detriment of both, soul music was fundamentally music by, about, and for adults. When my ma put on her auburn wig to see Otis Redding, or her blue eyeliner to watch the Supremes, it was to experience things so raw and so smooth, they weren't right for a child to see.",

        "passage_text": "Passage A by Jen Doll\n\nLeaving a group of friends the other night, I turned to wave. \"Text me!\" one of them said, waggling her thumbs in the air. I didn't need the words to understand.\n\nToday, we may be more likely to move our fingers across a tablet than turn the pages of a book; to swipe a card, press a button, or enter numbers onto a keypad than turn a key. We type on keyboards more often than we put pens to paper, and we roll down the windows of our cars by pressing a button instead of cranking a handle. Yet when it comes to gesturing, certain outdated motions endure.\n\nGestures can generally be sorted into two categories, according to Spencer Kelly, an associate professor of psychology at Colgate University. \"Co-speech gestures\" are the idiosyncratic, often unconscious ways we move our hands as we talk. Researchers believe these gestures help us think and speak and even learn. \"Emblematic gestures\" are the culturally codified motions that we use to supplement or substitute speech—the peace sign, the thumbs-up. Some of these gestures are symbolic, and some, as in the case of thumb-texting, are imitative.\n\nAs with words, we tend to pick up our hand movements from the groups with whom we communicate most frequently—especially our peers. If your friends are thumb-texting at you, you will thumb-text back at them. Soon enough, Kelly says, \"the movement of your thumbs can be done without speech, and people know what it is. That's the definition of an emblem.\"\n\nSome emblems are recycled, their meanings changing as cultures evolve. Anthony Corbeill at the University of Kansas suspects that the current American connotation of the thumbs-up gesture developed during the 20th century, when GIs used the thumbs-up to signify that a plane was cleared for takeoff. Other emblems are coined afresh, the result of ubiquitous new technology or the quirks of a public figure. The fist bump, which went viral after Barack and Michelle Obama were photographed in action in 2008, can be traced to the germophobic mid-20th-century baseball player Stan Musial, who is said to have preferred it to the high five.\n\nPassage B by Ipke Wachsmuth\n\nThe interpretations of sounds and movements are closely related. For years, the link could be demonstrated only indirectly by asking test subjects what information they gleaned from others who were speaking and gesticulating. Recent brain research has provided much better insight. For example, neuroscientist Spencer D. Kelly of Colgate University has studied gestures with the help of event-related potentials—characteristic brain waves consisting of a sequence of peaks and valleys—that occur in certain patterns when one person observes another communicating. The patterns reveal neuronal-processing steps in particular brain regions. One of the negative peaks (a valley), referred to as N400, is especially significant. It occurs when we stumble over an inappropriate and unexpected word, for example, when we hear a sentence like \"He spread his toast with socks.\"\n\nKelly hooked test subjects to an electroencephalograph and charted their event-related potentials while they watched a video. In it, an actor spoke while using gestures to indicate characteristics of an object. A hand movement might fit a word semantically, such as when the word \"tall\" was illustrated by gesturing at a long-stem glass on a table. A gesture might also be used to convey additional information, such as when \"tall\" was accompanied by finger movements that indicated the thinness of the elongated stem of the glass. Viewers saw contradictory scenes, too, in which an actor combined the word \"tall\" with a gesture that referred to a short object on the table. And sometimes an actor made no gesture at all; in this control situation, the test subjects heard only the spoken word.\n\nSubjects exhibited substantially different brain-wave patterns depending on the situation. The researchers found strong negative peaks—a so-called N400 effect—whenever speech and gesture contradicted one another. They interpreted this phenomenon to mean that gestures and words are in fact processed together: observers factor the meaning of a gesture into their interpretation of a word.\n\nThis conclusion was supported by the finding that the event-related potentials exhibited no comparable negativity in the control situation. Even during early processing, the curves differ depending on whether the hand movement fits the word, complements it or contradicts it. \"The semantic content\" of hand gestures, Kelly says, \"contributes to the processing of word meaning in the brain.\"",

        "passage_text": "Close up, Francesca Cappelletti could see the damage caused to the Doria St. John by time. Over its entire surface the picture had lost many tiny particles of paint, mere pinpricks—puntinature, Paola Sannucci, the restorer, called them—not discernible from a normal viewing distance. These particles had fallen at nearly regular intervals, at the intersections where the threads of the canvas, the warp and the weft, crossed each other and formed small nodules. The canvas had been cheap, made of poor-quality hemp and carelessly woven. Still, Caravaggio might have used just such a canvas. He had once painted a picture on a bedsheet. Another time, after he'd left the Mattei palazzo and was living alone in a small house off the Via della Scrofa, he had spread a half-finished canvas on a kitchen table and dined off the back of it.\n\nThe earlier examination of the Capitoline St. John had revealed it to be in much better shape than the Doria, in large part because the Capitoline canvas was of higher quality, more tightly woven with linen threads of uniform diameter.\n\nThe technical examination lasted the entire day, and for long periods Francesca had nothing to do but observe. The portable X-ray machine could capture only a small portion of the painting, and the technicians had to keep repositioning the machine, sixteen times in all, to get a composite of the entire picture. Francesca wandered in and out of the room and tried to dream up an excuse for leaving early.\n\nGiampaolo Correale had a particular interest—an obsession, one could call it—with finding incised lines in Caravaggio's paintings. Few other Baroque painters had made these types of lines, scored with the butt end of a brush into the wet undercoat, and no one had made them in quite the same way as Caravaggio. He painted from life, from models sitting before him, and most art historians believed that he didn't make preliminary drawings. In this, he had departed from a long-established tradition by which painters made detailed studies before applying brush to canvas. The scored lines, it was surmised, had served as a guide for positioning his models. In the finished paintings, the lines were sometimes visible to the naked eye, usually at a certain angle, in a raking light. Not every one of his paintings revealed signs of these marks. But to Caravaggio experts, their presence was almost as good as the artist's signature.\n\nTwo weeks earlier, during the examination of the Capitoline St. John, Correale had hoped to find incised lines, and thus add to the proof that it was Caravaggio's original. He and Paola Sannucci and the technicians had scrutinized every inch of the painting, but in the end they had not found a scoring mark. True, there were a few faint ridges on the borders of the boy's figure, and for a while Correale maintained that these could be scoring marks, but everyone else interpreted them merely as brushstrokes in wet paint, places where Caravaggio had defined the boy's flesh against the dark background.\n\nBut evidence of a different kind had emerged from beneath the surface of the Capitoline version, and it seemed to confirm the painting's authenticity. The X rays and the infrared images had revealed a ghostly image—a pentimento—at the precise point where the boy's arm and the curved horn of the ram intersected. The artist had painted the arm first, and then had painted the ram's horn over the finished arm. This constituted a clear sign that the painting was the authentic one. A copyist, following the outlines of an original painting, would not have bothered to paint the arm and then paint the horn over it. The infrared images also revealed other pentimenti, in the folds and drapery of the red and white cloths, and in the foliage in the dark background. These were false starts and adjustments that no copyist would have needed to make.\n\nSo Correale had come to accept the Capitoline as the original even before the technical examination of the Doria version. All the same, the paintings were so strikingly similar—the outline of one placed atop the other matched in almost every contour—that it seemed necessary to examine the Doria picture as fully as the Capitoline. But how, Correale wondered, could anyone make such a near perfect copy?\n\nThis question interested Francesca, too. She thought of all the copies art historian Roberto Longhi had found of Caravaggio's lost Taking of Christ. None of them had been good enough for Longhi to mistake for the original. Yet the Doria St. John had fooled him completely.",

        "passage_text": "Safely stored behind the scenes at the Natural History Museum in London is a slightly twisted vertebrate skeleton preserved on a slab of creamy white limestone. This particular specimen was discovered in quarries near Solnhofen in southern Germany in 1861. The fine limestones of Solnhofen are ideally suited to making lithographic stones, and in the nineteenth century lithographs provided one of the most important means of book illustration—indeed lithographic stones of this quality are still in demand by artists today. Vast quantities of this lithographic limestone of Jurassic age—about 150 million years old—have been taken out of opencast workings, where the rocks can be split into convenient slabs a centimetre or two thick. On many of these flat-surfaced pieces of rock, fossils are laid out like gifts on a salver.\n\nSome Solnhofen fossils are rather common, such as those of delicate little sea lilies. Others are both rare and more spectacular. There are a great variety of fish species known nowhere else, for example. The fossil horseshoe crab Mesolimulus provides evidence that its living relatives breeding each year along the Atlantic coast of America have changed little over tens of millions of years. Delicate flying reptiles—half a dozen species or so of pterodactyl—testify by contrast to creatures that have vanished from the Earth forever. A few species of dinosaur are known, of the most delicate sort (Compsognathus), and quite unlike the monsters of popular imagination. Insects include dragonflies (Aeschnogomphus) whose every wing-vein is visible as delicate tracery. All these creatures are preserved in rocks which originated as tacky muds flooring a lagoon that lay offshore from a richly biodiverse habitat. Such special circumstances sampled and preserved a much wider variety of organisms than the usual fossil locality, and the wide range of fossils provides a rare window into an entire habitat from a very different world. Yet if the remains were not kept carefully in museums all this evidence of past life would perish, and new generations of children and scholars could not interrogate the past. Local museums at Eichstatt and Solnhofen fulfil that function for those who would come to Bavaria and marvel at its geological treasures. But some of the specimens from the Solnhofen limestone have a relevance that extends far beyond the reconstruction of the late Jurassic scene, and these specimens are treasures in the collections of museums around the world. None more so than that specimen—a mere 35 cm at its longest—safely curated in the Natural History Museum in London.\n\nFor this is the first example ever discovered of the early bird Archaeopteryx. It remains one of the most important specimens in the British national collections. The next complete fossil bird of the same species—the so-called Berlin specimen—was found sixteen years later. It would be difficult to overstate the importance of this London specimen of Archaeopteryx in the history of biology.\n\nFirst, the date of its discovery is only two years after the publication of The Origin of Species. Charles Darwin famously described what he called 'difficulties on theory' in that work, where he anticipated a number of criticisms that he expected his great idea to encounter. Prime among these was 'the rarity or absence of intermediate forms' in the fossil record.\n\nSecond, the detailed scientific description of Archaeopteryx was an accomplishment of Richard Owen in 1863; he was later to become first director of the Natural History Museum. Owen was no Darwinian, but he was an able anatomist. It must have proved anathema to him when Archaeopteryx was recruited as probably the best example of an 'intermediate form' and one that had turned up with the impeccable timing usually associated with a good piece of theatre. Its amalgam of reptilian and bird features (feathers and wishbone among them) was a striking vindication of the notion of descent with modification, and a rebuttal to those who might wonder how it was possible for animals to make the transition from earth to the skies.\n\nIn this sense Archaeopteryx became a kind of talisman for evolution. Owen was enough of a 'Museum man' to ensure that this fossil was safely curated, and part of any museum's function is just that—to protect material regardless of the current explanations of its importance. The old bird has now been joined by half a dozen or so subsequent examples worldwide, but its importance has not diminished over the years.",

        "passage_text": "What I cherish I've come to slowly, usually blindly, not seeing it for some time, and that's just how I discovered Jacobs' Mound. This old travelers' marker shows up clearly from two highways, yet I was here several days before I noticed it, this isolated frustum so distinct. I must have been looking too closely and narrowly, but once I saw its volcano-cone symmetry I was drawn to it as western travelers have always been to lone protuberances—Independence Rock, Pompey's Pillar, Chimney Rock—and within a day I headed down the Bloody Creek Road until the lane played out in a grassed vale.\n\nI walked down a hawk-harried ridge and struck out toward the mound, seemingly near enough to reach before sunset. In places the October grasses reached to my belt and stunted my strides. From the tall heads of Indian grass and the brown stalks of gayfeather, gossamer strung out in the slow wind, and these web lines snagged my trousers and chest and head until, after a mile, I was bestrung and on my way to becoming cocooned. I stopped to watch small events but never for long because the mound was drawing me as if it were a stone vortex in a petrified sea.\n\nThere are several ways not to walk in the prairie, and one of them is with your eye on a far goal, because you then begin to believe you're not closing the distance any more than you would with a mirage. My woodland sense of scale and time didn't fit this country, and I started wondering whether I could reach the summit before dark. On the prairie, distance and the miles of air turn movement to stasis and openness to a wall, a thing as difficult to penetrate as dense forest. It seemed every time I raised a step the earth rotated under me so that my foot fell just where it had lifted from. Limits and markers make travel possible for people: circumscribe our lines of sight and we can really get somewhere. Before me lay the Kansas of popular conception from Coronado on—that place you have to get through, that purgatory of mileage.\n\nBut I kept walking, and, when I dropped into hollows and the mound disappeared, I focused on a rock or a tuft of grass to keep from convoluting my track. Hiking in the woods allows a traveler to imagine comforting enclosures, one leading to the next, and the walker can possess those little encompassed spaces, but the prairie and plains permit no such possession. Whatever else prairie is—grass, sky, wind—it is most of all a paradigm of infinity, a clearing full of many things except boundaries, and its power comes from its apparent limitlessness; there is no such thing as a small prairie any more than there is a little ocean.\n\nI came up out of a hollow, Jacobs' Mound big now on the horizon, and I could feel its swell in my legs, and then I was in the steep climb up its slope, and: I was on top. From the highway I'd guessed the summit to be the size of a city block, but it was less than a baseball infield, its elliptical perimeter just a hundred strides. So, its power lay not in size but rather in shape and dominion and its thrust into the imagination.\n\nI sat and looked. The thousands of acres that lay encircled around the knob I really didn't see, not at first. I saw air, and I recalled a woman saying, Seems the air here hasn't ever been used before. From a plane you look down, and from a mountain you look down, but from Jacobs' Mound you look out, out into. You're not up in the sky and you're not on the ground: you're nicely in-between, at the altitude of those who fly in their dreams and skim roofs and treetops. Jacobs' Mound is thrush-flight high.\n\nAnd then I understood: I like this prairie county because of its illusion of being away, out of, and I like how its unpopulousness seems to isolate it. Seventy percent of Americans live on two percent of the land, but in front of me, no percentage of them lived. Yet, in the far southeast, I could see trucks inching out the turnpike miles, the turbulence of their passage silenced by distance. And I could see fence lines, transmission towers, and dug ponds, things the pioneers would have viewed as marks of a progressive civilization but which to me, a grousing neo-primitivist, were signs of the continuing onslaught. The view I had homesteaders would have loved, and the one they had of unbroken vegetation and its diversities I would cherish. In the nineteenth century, the Kansas clergyman and author William Quayle traded his autograph for an acre of prairie, and, yesterday, I thought him a thief, but now, seeing the paltriness of an acre, I figured he was the one swindled.",

        "passage_text": "It was never Kenney Holmes's intention to become a wedding singer. The grandson of West Indian immigrants, Holmes was raised in Gordon Heights, on Long Island, in what he calls \"a small black community founded by like-minded thinkers,\" families of immigrants and Southern blacks who, as Holmes says, \"didn't come here to fool around\" and who handed down to their children their own keen sense of ambition.\n\n\"We grew up in that kind of atmosphere,\" he says, \"of positive thinking, of getting educated, whether or not you had a degree.\"\n\nLike any American boy in the 1950s and '60s, he was fascinated with popular music: He listened to the area's one radio station, which \"mostly played Sinatra\"; sometimes in the evenings, with a coat hanger stuck into the top of his portable radio, he could pick up a faint signal from WWRL, a rhythm and blues station in New York City. When he was a teenager, his brother brought home a guitar. \"I was 16, it was a Sunday night,\" he says. \"I sat down and played 'I Can't Get No Satisfaction.' I was addicted.\"\n\nWhile he was not a virtuoso, he was, he discovered, good at making money at it. He learned three songs—\"Satisfaction\" by the Rolling Stones, \"And I Love Her\" by the Beatles, and \"Shotgun\" by Junior Walker and the All Stars—and formed a band. \"We went out and sold it,\" he says. \"We could play those three songs all night. We got pretty popular out on the island, playing battle of the bands, fire halls, high school proms, for $10 a night.\"\n\nStill, a career as a musician was not what he, or his family, had had in mind. Over the next few years, he says: \"I did everything I could not to be a guitar player. I went to college not to be a guitar player.\" Thinking he would be a psychiatrist, he took pre-med classes but didn't complete a degree. Along the way, he continued playing nightclubs and parties.\n\nIn his mid-20s, he visited his brother in Washington. Washington looked, to Holmes, like a good place to be an ambitious, career-minded black man, but it also had a thriving music scene in nightclubs and hotel lounges, and the next 15 years played out as a sort of tussle between his creative pursuits and his more business-driven impulses. Trying to work his way up in the music scene, he played five and six nights a week in nightclubs and wrote his own music. He started a recording studio called Sound Ideas, which trawled local talent for the makings of a hit song, but he found the pickings slim.\n\nThe club scene, after a long while, began to wear on him, as well. Unwilling to resign himself to the life of a starving artist, when an agent approached him in the early '90s about specializing in wedding and private parties, Holmes decided to try it.\n\nIt was a revelation. \"I could make in one night what I used to make in five,\" he says. And \"it changed the culture of what I was doing.\"\n\nHolmes was well-suited for the role of event bandleader. His production skills helped him control his band's sound, and his familiarity with country, big-band and classical music made him popular with audiences who wanted, as he says, \"a tango or a Viennese waltz,\" as well as Wilson Pickett.\n\nBecause business ebbs and flows with the seasons and the economy, Holmes has always kept a variety of sidelines, including a job driving a limousine for nine years to put his oldest daughter through a private high school and college. These days, at gigs, he hands out a stack of million-dollar \"bills\" printed with his image and his current enterprises: bandleader, commercial mortgage broker, hard money lender.\n\nHolmes uses as many as eight musicians and two singers for weddings. He accepts turnover as a fact of running a band, but his current core lineup has, in the mercurial world of part-time performers, been fairly steady. Sam Brawner, the drummer, and Atiba Taylor, the sax player, have played with him for three and four years, respectively, and Bruce Robinson, the keyboardist, has played with him for 15.\n\nThis is perhaps partly because Holmes insists on making music. During performances, he lets his musicians take the lead and uses specialized, stripped-down tracks, called digital sequences, to set the tempo and fill in musical parts when necessary, ultimately preferring the messy alchemy of live music to something more canned. The musicians say that this is in contrast to other bandleaders they've worked for, who often rely heavily on recordings and use musicians more as visual props. Holmes's respect for the music endears him to his musicians. \"These guys play from the heart,\" says Robinson. \"They're not just trying to get through the gig.\"",

        "passage_text": "Using photographs as educational resources presents particular challenges and must be done with care. There is always more than face value in any photo, and historical photos of American Indians are no exception. Photography's rise in the late nineteenth century coincided with great change in American Indian communities—an era that capped over three hundred years of diseases, wars, cultural disruption, and land dispossession. As Indian people struggled to adapt to catastrophic changes to their old ways of living, photographers took thousands of studio portraits and made what they believed to be neutral ethnographic images of the \"vanishing Indian.\" As Indian cultures bent under pressure to assimilate into mainstream America, photographers routinely captured images that compared the new \"civilized\" Indian to the tradition-bound \"savages.\" Indian delegations that traveled to Washington, D.C., to defend tribal treaty rights were photographed in studios and in front of federal buildings. Photographers also accompanied government expeditions to the West where they documented traditional cultures, leading the way for tourists and commercial photographers who followed, carrying their cameras and preconceptions into Native American communities. These efforts generated a legacy of photographic images of American Indian people that can serve today as rich educational resources. But if used carelessly, they can also fuel romanticized and stereotypical perceptions of American Indians.\n\nConsider some of the many photographs of Goyathlay, the Apache man who Mexicans named \"Geronimo.\" He and other Chiricahua Apaches fought a protracted war from 1863 to 1886 against the United States for the right to live in their traditional homelands rather than on reservations.\n\nThe Chiricahua Apaches' fight for freedom captured the American imagination in the late nineteenth century. \"Geronimo,\" especially, became a legendary figure and a media phenomenon whose legacy has lasted into the twenty-first century. He became synonymous with courage, daring, and savage ruthlessness. World War II paratroopers shouted his name as they jumped from airplanes into combat. Movies, television shows, comic books, popular songs, posters, T-shirts, and American cities have borne his image and name. One photo that shows Goyathlay and three other Chiricahuas in their camp just prior to surrendering to U.S. forces in 1886 documents a critical and difficult day for the people who had fought so diligently for their freedom.\n\nIn another well-known studio portrait, circa 1890, Goyathlay poses with a rifle. To late-nineteenth-century Americans, Geronimo was a dangerous enemy, yet at the same time a curiosity and romantic symbol of the \"Wild West.\" This photo personifies the renegade image but, strangely, it was taken about two to four years after Goyathlay surrendered—while he was a prisoner of war. Why, then, was this photo taken? What meaning did it convey at the time? What must have been in Goyathlay's mind? What does the photo mean today? Is it loaded with historical truths or is it as empty as the prisoner's bullet chamber?\n\nA few years later, Goyathlay was photographed again, this time in a more pastoral pose and place—holding a melon in a garden with his wife and three of their children. What was the meaning behind this photo? Did people of the time see it as a simple family photo, or did it personify the government's policy toward Indians at the time—subduing feared and hated warriors, \"re-educating\" them, and teaching them to farm in order to guide them toward a \"better\" way of life? Ironically, the Apaches had long farmed as part of the traditional life they fought so tenaciously to protect.\n\nThe educational potential of photographs is enormous. However, photographs are not objective; they can easily tell as many lies as truths. As much as any written document, they have to be read with care in order to be understood accurately in unbiased and nonstereotypical terms. Every photo of people contains history, culture, and context. To do justice to the subjects and their stories, it is crucial to fill in the information gaps. In addition to conducting background research, try putting yourself inside these photos—stand next to Goyathlay, his peers, his wife, and their children, and imagine their lives—you might begin to understand the world from their points of view. Framed with factual information and viewed empathetically, each photograph can reach its richest potential as a significant educational opportunity and resource.",

        "passage_text": "Adaptations of plants to deserts include dormancy and a variety of structural and behavioral adaptations. The majority of desert plants depend on a strategy that capitalizes on small size. They are annuals that spring up from dry, dormant, heat-resistant seeds. Some of these seeds may wait up to half a century before they are activated. The plants' challenge is to be quick enough to respond to rain so that they can produce their seeds before the earth dries up again, while not jumping the gun to start growth until there is sufficient water for them to grow to maturity for seed production. Some achieve this balance on a tightrope by \"measuring\" rainfall. They have chemicals in their seeds that inhibit germination, and a minimum amount of rain is required before these are leached out. Others have seed coats that must be mechanically scarred to permit sufficient wetting for germination, and the scarring happens only when they are subjected to flash floods in the riverbeds where they grow. A plant in the Negev Desert releases its seed from a tough capsule only under the influence of water through a mechanism that resembles a Roman ballistic machine. Its two outer sepals generate sideways tension that can fling two seeds out of the fruit, but the two seeds are held inside by a lock mechanism at the top. However, when the sepals are sufficiently wetted, then the tension increases to such an extent that the lock mechanism snaps, and the capsule \"explodes\" and releases the seeds.\n\nIn moist regions where it rains predictably (though not necessarily in abundance), we help agricultural plants to capture the precipitation by scarring the soil to facilitate the infiltration of the water into it, and hence into the roots. Least runoff and maximum water absorption are achieved by plowing the soil. However, such a strategy would not work in a true desert such as the Negev. A different program is required there because rain is infrequent and plowing would facilitate only the evaporation of scarce water from the soil. The solution applied by the peoples who inhabited the Negev in past centuries was a practice they called \"runoff farming.\" Farmers had mastered harnessing the flash floods that rush down into the gullies by catching the runoffs—not only by making terraces but also by building large cisterns into which the water was directed to be held for later use. Remnants of these constructions still exist.\n\nWater-storage mechanisms have been invented by other organisms living in deserts, but mainly through modifications of body plan. Many plants, especially cacti and euphorbia, have the ability to swell their roots or stems with water stores. Possibly the most familiar is the saguaro cactus, Carnegiea gigantea, of the Sonoran desert in the American southwest. It has a shallow root system that extends in all directions to distances of about its height, fifty feet. In one rainstorm the root system can soak up 200 gallons of water, which are transferred into its tall trunk. This trunk is pleated like an accordion and can swell to store tons of water that can last the plant for a year. The cactus has no leaves, but the stem is green and can photosynthesize and produce nutrients as well as store water. The saguaro's survival strategy requires it to grow extremely slowly. But it lives a century or more.\n\nSome desert animals similarly store water. The frog Cyclorana platycephala, from the northern Australian desert, fills up and greatly expands its urinary bladder to use as a water bag before burying itself in the soil, where it spends most of the year waiting for the next rain. While in the ground it sloughs off skin and forms around itself a nearly waterproof cocoon that resembles a plastic bag and reduces evaporative water loss.\n\nDesert ants of a variety of species (of at least seven different genera) in American as well as Australian deserts collectively called \"honeypot ants\" have evolved a solution that combines water storage with energy storage. Ants typically feed each other; and some of the larger worker ants may take up more liquid than the others, and others may bring more. Those that take the fluid may gorge themselves until they distend their abdomens up to the size of a grape, by which time they are unable to move from the spot. They then hang in groups of dozens to hundreds from the ceiling of a chamber in the ant nest, where they are then the specialized so-called repletes that later regurgitate fluid when the colony members are no longer bringing the fluid in but rather needing it.",

        "introduction": "This passage describes the transformation of aluminum from a precious metal to an industrial commodity.",
        "passage_text": "During the middle of the nineteenth century, aluminum was considered one of the most precious metals on Earth, valued alongside gold and platinum for its rarity and the difficulty involved in extracting it from its ore. The metal's unique properties—its light weight, resistance to corrosion, and attractive silvery appearance—made it highly sought after by manufacturers and craftspeople, but its extraordinary cost limited its use to only the most exclusive applications.\n\nThe scarcity and expense of aluminum during this period led to some remarkable displays of wealth and status. Napoleon III of France, known for his extravagant lifestyle, served his most honored guests using aluminum dinnerware, while lesser guests had to make do with mere gold and silver utensils. The metal was so valuable that when the Washington Monument was completed in 1884, the United States government chose to cap it with a 100-ounce pyramid of aluminum, deliberately flaunting the nation's industrial might and prosperity.\n\nFor manufacturers of the era, aluminum represented both tremendous potential and frustrating limitations. They could envision countless applications for a metal that combined strength with lightness, that resisted rust and corrosion better than iron or steel, and that could be shaped and formed with relative ease. However, the prohibitive cost—aluminum was more expensive per pound than silver—meant that these applications remained largely theoretical.\n\nThis situation began to change when Charles Martin Hall, a young American chemist studying at Oberlin College, became fascinated by his professor Frank Jewett's lectures about what Jewett called the \"aluminum El Dorado\"—the fortune that awaited anyone who could develop an economical method for extracting aluminum from its compounds. Hall believed deeply in Jewett's vision and dedicated himself to solving this confounding scientific problem.\n\nWorking in a makeshift laboratory in his family's woodshed, Hall experimented tirelessly with different chemical processes and electrical techniques. After months of failed attempts and frustrating setbacks, he finally achieved a breakthrough in February 1886. By dissolving aluminum oxide in molten cryolite and passing an electric current through the mixture, Hall found that he could produce pure aluminum metal at a fraction of the previous cost.\n\nHall's process was elegant in its simplicity and devastating in its effectiveness. Almost overnight, the economics of aluminum production were completely transformed. What had been a precious metal more valuable than gold became a relatively inexpensive industrial commodity. The \"precious\" metal that had graced the tables of emperors and topped the Washington Monument suddenly became affordable enough for everyday applications.\n\nBut Hall knew that his discovery alone was not enough. Other scientists were working on similar problems, and he was aware that Paul Héroult, a French chemist, had stumbled upon an almost identical process around the same time. This competition spurred Hall to move quickly from laboratory success to industrial application.\n\nIn 1888, Hall founded the Pittsburgh Reduction Company, which would later become the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa). His timing proved crucial, as the demand for lightweight, corrosion-resistant metal was growing rapidly with the expansion of the electrical industry and the early development of aviation technology.\n\nThe transformation of aluminum from precious metal to industrial commodity had profound effects beyond simple economics. Industries that had been limited by the weight and corrosion problems of traditional metals suddenly had new possibilities. The automotive industry, the emerging aerospace sector, and countless manufacturing applications were revolutionized by the availability of inexpensive aluminum.\n\nHall's achievement also demonstrated the power of persistence and methodical scientific investigation. His success came not from a sudden flash of inspiration but from months of careful experimentation, detailed record-keeping, and willingness to learn from repeated failures.\n\nBy the time of Hall's death in 1914, aluminum had become so common that it was difficult to imagine that it had once been more precious than gold. An American chemist, working in a simple shed with basic equipment, had fundamentally altered the material possibilities of the modern world. What Hall had accomplished in his makeshift laboratory would have seemed impossible to the manufacturers and craftsmen of just a few decades earlier.",

        "author": "Marine Biology Research",
        "source": "Practice ACT 3",
        "introduction": "This passage examines the threats facing coral reef ecosystems and conservation efforts.",
        "passage_text": "Coral reefs, often called the \"underwater rainforests\" of the ocean, represent some of the most biodiverse and productive ecosystems on Earth. These complex marine communities support an estimated 25% of all marine species, despite covering less than 1% of the ocean floor. However, these vital ecosystems now face unprecedented threats from climate change, pollution, and human activities, leading many scientists to warn that we may be witnessing the beginning of a global coral reef collapse.\n\nThe foundation of coral reef ecosystems lies in the remarkable symbiotic relationship between coral polyps—tiny marine animals related to sea anemones—and zooxanthellae, microscopic algae that live within the coral's tissues. This partnership benefits both organisms: the algae provide the coral with nutrients through photosynthesis, while the coral offers the algae protection and access to sunlight in the clear, shallow waters where reefs typically develop.\n\nThis delicate symbiosis makes coral reefs particularly vulnerable to environmental changes. When ocean temperatures rise even by small amounts, the relationship between coral and algae breaks down in a process known as coral bleaching. Stressed corals expel their algae partners, losing their primary source of nutrition and their characteristic vibrant colors. If conditions do not return to normal quickly, the bleached corals will die, leaving behind empty calcium carbonate skeletons.\n\nThe scale of coral bleaching events has increased dramatically in recent decades. The Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest coral reef system, experienced massive bleaching events in 2016 and 2017 that affected more than two-thirds of the reef's northern section. Similar events have been documented in reef systems throughout the Caribbean, the Pacific, and the Indian Ocean, suggesting that rising ocean temperatures pose a global threat to coral reef survival.\n\nOcean acidification presents another serious challenge to coral reef ecosystems. As the ocean absorbs increasing amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, seawater becomes more acidic, making it difficult for corals and other marine organisms to build and maintain their calcium carbonate structures. This process essentially dissolves the foundation upon which coral reef ecosystems are built.\n\nBeyond climate-related threats, coral reefs face numerous local stressors that compound their vulnerability. Coastal development leads to increased sedimentation and nutrient runoff, which can smother corals and promote the growth of algae that compete with coral for space and light. Overfishing disrupts the delicate balance of reef ecosystems by removing key species that help control algae growth and maintain reef health.\n\nPollution from agricultural runoff, sewage, and industrial activities introduces harmful chemicals and excess nutrients into reef environments. These pollutants can directly poison marine life and create conditions that favor the growth of harmful bacteria and algae over healthy coral communities.\n\nDespite these mounting challenges, coral reefs demonstrate remarkable resilience when given the opportunity to recover. Some reef systems have shown the ability to adapt to changing conditions, with certain coral species proving more tolerant of temperature fluctuations and acidification than others. Understanding these adaptive mechanisms provides hope for conservation efforts and may inform strategies for helping reefs survive in a changing climate.\n\nConservation efforts are focusing on multiple approaches to protect and restore coral reef ecosystems. Marine protected areas help reduce local stressors by limiting fishing, boat traffic, and coastal development in critical reef areas. Coral gardening and transplantation programs work to restore damaged reef areas by growing coral fragments in nurseries and then transplanting them to degraded reef sites.\n\nScientists are also exploring innovative approaches such as selective breeding of heat-tolerant coral species and the development of probiotics that could help corals resist disease and environmental stress. Some researchers are investigating the possibility of assisted evolution, using techniques to help corals develop greater tolerance to warming temperatures and changing ocean chemistry.\n\nThe future of coral reefs will depend on both global action to address climate change and local efforts to reduce direct human impacts on reef ecosystems. Success will require international cooperation, coordinated policy responses, and sustained commitment to marine conservation across multiple scales and timeframes.\n\nAs I have documented through my underwater photography over the past decade, the changes in coral reef ecosystems are both dramatic and heartbreaking. Yet I have also witnessed the remarkable beauty and resilience of these systems, which continue to support incredible biodiversity even under stress. The challenge now is to act quickly enough to preserve these underwater rainforests for future generations, recognizing that their loss would represent not just an environmental catastrophe but the disappearance of some of the most magnificent communities of life on our planet.",

        "passage_text": "Of the many great civilizations that flourished and withered in ancient Anatolia, the Lydian does not rank among the best known. The Lydians formed a small kingdom in the seventh century BC, but at its height, the Lydian kingdom was little more than an overgrown city-state spread out from Sardis. The Lydian kings were not celebrated in myth or song as great warriors, conquerors, builders, or even lovers. Only one name of ancient Lydia is commonly known today—Croesus. He ascended to the Lydian throne in 560 BC to rule a kingdom that was already rich. His ancestors had made a firm economic basis for the kingdom's wealth by manufacturing some of the best perfumes and cosmetics of the ancient world; yet these goods alone could not have raised Croesus to the level of wealth that myth accords him. For that, he depended on another invention of his ancestors—coins, a new and revolutionary form of money.\n\nSomething similar to money and something resembling markets can be found in Mesopotamia, China, Egypt, and many other parts of the world, but they did not actually use coins until the rise of Lydia and the subsequent minting of the first coins, between 640 and 630 BC. The genius of the Lydian kings can be seen in their recognition of the need for very small and easily transported ingots worth no more than a few days' labor or a small part of a farmer's harvest. By making these small ingots in a standardized size and weight, and by stamping on them an emblem that verified their worth to even the illiterate, the kings of Lydia exponentially expanded the possibilities of commercial enterprise.\n\nThe Lydians made the first coins of electrum, a naturally occurring mixture of gold and silver. They made the electrum into oval slugs several times thicker than modern coins, or about the size of the end digit of an adult's thumb. To ensure their authenticity, the king had each one stamped with the emblem of a lion's head. The stamping also flattened the lumps, beginning their transition from an oval nugget to a flat, circular coin. By making the nuggets the same weight and thus approximately the same size, the king eliminated one of the most time-consuming steps in commerce: the need to weigh the gold each time a transaction was made. Now merchants could assess the value by tale, or by simply counting the number of coins. Such standardization greatly reduced the opportunity for cheating on the amount or quality of gold and silver in an exchange. One did not need to be an expert in handling a scale or in judging the purity of metal in order to buy a basket of wheat, a pair of sandals, or an amphora of olive oil. The use of coins that had been weighed and stamped in the royal workshop made it possible for commerce to proceed much more rapidly and honestly, and it allowed people to participate even if they did not own a scale. The commerce of coins opened up new dimensions for new segments of the population.\n\nThe wealth of Croesus and his ancestors arose not from conquest but from trade. During his reign (560-546 BC), Croesus created new coins of pure gold and silver rather than electrum. Using their newly invented coins as a standardized medium of exchange, the Lydian merchants traded in the daily necessities of life—grain, oil, leather, pottery, and wood—as well as in luxury goods such as perfumes, cosmetics, jewelry, musical instruments, glazed ceramics, bronze figurines, mohair, purple cloth, marble, and ivory.\n\nThe variety and abundance of commercial goods quickly led to another innovation: the retail market. Rather than leaving buyers to seek out the home of someone who might have oil or jewelry to sell, the kings of Sardis set up an innovative new system in which anyone, even a stranger, with something to sell could come to a central market. Numerous small shops lined the market, and each merchant specialized in particular goods. One sold meat, and another offered grain. One sold jewelry, another cloth. One sold musical instruments, another pots. This market system began in the late seventh century BC, but its descendants can clearly be seen in the later Greek agora, in the medieval market squares of northern Europe, and in suburban shopping malls of the contemporary United States. With the conquest of Lydia by Cyrus, the reign of Croesus ended, and the Lydian kingdom disappeared from the pages of history. The impact of that small and relatively unknown kingdom has remained vastly disproportionate to its geographic size and relatively minor role in ancient history.",

        "passage_text": "Passage A by Thad Carhart\n\nEven when Luc was busy and could not talk he always made me welcome and allowed me to wander around the inner sanctum of the back room on my own. When things were quieter, he seemed glad of the company and would tell me about the pianos that had just arrived. Our talks made real for me one of his fundamental beliefs, that each and every piano had completely individual characteristics, even if of the same manufacturer and age.\n\nSometimes he knew all the details, had even met the owners and talked about their instrument with them and knew intimately how they had treated it. Other times he knew nothing beyond what he could see, feel, or hear. Most often pianos came to him from auctions and charity sales, their history anonymous. But even then, like an expert in artifacts, he could deduce a great deal: whether a piano had been played much or little, whether it had been in an environment with the proper level of humidity (one of his cardinal rules), whether there had been children in the household, even whether it had recently been transported by ship. (\"The worst thing you can possibly do to a piano,\" he told me more than once.) At these moments he was part detective, part archaeologist, part social critic.\n\nHis attitude about how people treated their pianos seemed to mirror his philosophy of life. While regretting the depredations worked by children on keyboards and strings, he regarded them as tolerable because the piano was at least used and, as he put it, \"au sein de la famille\" (\"at the heart of the family\"). It was more than just any piece of furniture, but it was that, too, and if drinks were spilled and stains bit into shiny finishes, it was the price one paid for initiating the young to a joy that should stem from familiarity rather than reverence.\n\nThose who preserved their piano as an altar upon which the art of music was to be worshipped irritated Luc, but he was deeply respectful of serious musicians who used and depended upon their instrument for their livelihood.\n\nPassage B by Arnold Steinhardt\n\nMarc Lifschey, one of the greatest oboists of his era, told me that after retiring as a performer and teacher, he sold his oboe. On the face of it, giving up an instrument you no longer use seems perfectly reasonable, but nevertheless I was taken aback. Marc was not merely an excellent oboist; he was a great artist. Still, Marc didn't do it alone. He and his oboe did it together. Even in retirement, wouldn't Marc have some sort of lasting relationship with his oboe that transcended performing on it? Wouldn't he want to keep it if for no other reason than as a reminder of the magnificent music the two of them had made together?\n\nJoseph Roisman, the distinguished first violinist of the Budapest String Quartet, seemed to be content to give up his beloved Lorenzo Storioni when he agreed to sell it to me after the Quartet retired. But when I finally met with him, he had second thoughts. \"Steinhardt,\" he said to me plaintively, \"I'll sell the violin to you some day, but for now I'm enjoying playing chamber music with my friends every Friday night.\" And that is exactly what he did until his death a year or two later.\n\nLifschey and Roisman dealt with retirement in different ways, but their stories made me wonder about not only what I'll do with my violin if and when I retire, but also about the very nature of a musician's day-to-day, year-to-year relationship with his instrument.\n\nI began playing violin when I was six years old, and now I'm seventy-six. It has been an integral part of my life for the last seven decades. Does that make the violin my very close friend? Well, yes. Sometimes. The violin obviously can't speak with words, but when I ask something of it, the instrument can respond with an astonishing range of substance and emotion. This is friendship on a most exalted level.\n\nThere are other moments, however, when the violin stubbornly refuses to do my bidding—when it only reluctantly plays in tune, or makes the sound I want, or delivers the music's essence for which I strive. Then I have to cajole, bargain or adjust to its every whim. Some friend; more like an adversary, you might say.\n\nOr is the violin my partner? A woman once went backstage to congratulate the great violinist Jascha Heifetz after a concert. \"What a wonderful sound your violin has, Mr. Heifetz!\" she exclaimed. Heifetz leaned over his violin that lay in its open case, listened intently for a moment, and said, \"Funny, I don't hear a thing.\" My violin also lies mute in its case without me—but, on the other hand, I stand mute on the concert stage without it.",

        "introduction": "This passage discusses the challenges and benefits of finding writing spaces in New York City.",
        "passage_text": "In New York City, acquiring an apartment has become more daunting than ever before, with rents increasing dramatically and forcing many residents to make difficult compromises about space, location, and budget. For writers and artists in particular, finding an affordable space that also provides the quiet and solitude traditionally considered necessary for creative work presents unique challenges.\n\nTruman Capote once described his first apartment as \"a brownstone basement, dark and dampish but wonderfully cheap.\" Despite its obvious flaws—the lack of natural light, the persistent humidity, the cramped quarters—Capote found ways to make this imperfect space work for his writing. He transformed what others might have seen as merely adequate housing into a productive creative environment.\n\nSimilarly, Angie Cruz, author of Dominicana, has written about her own experience finding and making do with less-than-ideal living spaces in New York. Cruz's first apartment was a small one-bedroom in a pre-war building on the Upper West Side. While the rent was lower than that of similar apartments—a crucial factor for a young writer supporting herself through freelance teaching jobs—the space came with its own set of challenges.\n\nThe apartment's walls were thin, allowing sounds from neighboring units to filter through at all hours. Cruz could hear her upstairs neighbor's television, the couple next door arguing about household bills, and the family below practicing piano scales. What might have driven other tenants to distraction, however, Cruz came to view differently.\n\nRather than fighting the constant soundtrack of urban life around her, Cruz began to see these sounds as part of her writing environment. The voices of her neighbors, the rhythm of footsteps on stairs, the distant hum of traffic—all of this became woven into her daily writing routine. She realized that the complete silence many writers claim to need might not be necessary, or even beneficial, for her creative process.\n\nCruz's apartment was small and cluttered, filled with books stacked on every available surface, artwork from friends covering the walls, and a constantly rotating cast of visitors who would stay for days or weeks at a time. Her grandmother would come by with containers of food, friends would drop in to discuss their own writing projects, and family members would use her place as a temporary refuge when they needed somewhere to stay.\n\nThis constant activity and interaction, rather than being a hindrance to Cruz's work, became central to her development as a writer. Sitting at her desk in the corner of the main room, she would write while conversations happened around her, while her grandmother cooked in the kitchen, while friends debated politics or shared gossip from their neighborhoods.\n\nCruz eventually came to realize that her apartment, with all its noise and chaos and lack of privacy, had taught her something valuable about writing and community. The isolation that many writers seek—the quiet room of one's own that Virginia Woolf wrote about—might not be the only path to creative productivity.\n\nThe apartment also served as a gathering place for other young writers and artists, many of whom were also struggling to establish themselves in expensive New York. Cruz found that these informal meetings and conversations, happening spontaneously in her cramped living room, were often more valuable than the formal workshops and classes she had attended.\n\nWithout her family members there to offer encouragement and practical support, Cruz later reflected, she might not have felt confident enough about her career choice to continue pursuing writing seriously. The apartment, despite its limitations, had become not just a place to live but a crucial part of her artistic community and creative development.\n\nWhen Cruz returned to the city after completing her graduate studies, she found that her experience in that first apartment had fundamentally changed her approach to both writing and living. She no longer felt that she needed perfect conditions—absolute quiet, complete privacy, ideal lighting—in order to do her best work.",

        "introduction": "This passage explores the informal education of cooking through family traditions.",
        "passage_text": "My earliest memories of learning to cook are inseparable from the sounds, smells, and rhythms of my family's kitchen. Unlike many of my friends who learned cooking through formal instruction or by following recipes from cookbooks, my culinary education was entirely informal, passed down through observation, participation, and what my grandmother called \"kitchen wisdom.\"\n\nThe kitchen in our house was the center of family life, a small but efficient space where my mother, grandmother, and various aunts would gather throughout the day to prepare meals, share news, and maintain the complex network of relationships that held our extended family together. As a child, I would sit at the kitchen table doing homework while these women worked around me, their movements choreographed by years of practice and mutual understanding.\n\nMy grandmother's approach to cooking was intuitive rather than systematic. She never used written recipes, instead relying on techniques and proportions she had learned from her own mother and refined through decades of experience. When I asked her how much salt to add to a particular dish, she would tell me to \"taste and adjust,\" or demonstrate by showing me how the texture of bread dough should feel when it was ready for kneading.\n\nMy mother's cooking style was more practical and adaptable, influenced by the demands of feeding a large family on a limited budget while working full-time outside the home. She taught me how to make substitutions when ingredients weren't available, how to stretch a small amount of meat to serve many people, and how to transform leftovers into entirely new meals that didn't feel like repetitions of what we had eaten the day before.\n\nFrom both women, I learned that cooking was not just about following instructions but about understanding the principles behind techniques, developing judgment about flavors and textures, and being able to adapt to changing circumstances. This kitchen wisdom encompassed everything from how to tell when onions were properly caramelized to how to salvage a sauce that had broken or a soup that had become too salty.\n\nThe informal nature of my cooking education meant that I learned to be comfortable with improvisation and experimentation. Since there were no exact measurements to follow, I had to develop my own sense of proportion and timing. I learned to trust my senses—to judge doneness by smell and appearance rather than by strict adherence to cooking times, to adjust seasonings by taste rather than by measuring spoons.\n\nThis approach to learning cooking was completely different from the structured instruction that many of my friends received in school cooking classes or from cookbook-based learning. While they learned to follow recipes precisely and measure ingredients exactly, I was developing a more intuitive understanding of how ingredients behaved and how flavors combined.\n\nAs I grew older and began cooking for myself, I realized how valuable this informal education had been. I could walk into any kitchen and create a meal from whatever ingredients were available, without needing to consult recipes or worry about having exact measurements. The confidence I had gained from years of observation and hands-on practice allowed me to approach cooking as a creative activity rather than as a series of technical procedures to be followed precisely.\n\nWhen I began teaching my own children to cook, I consciously chose to follow the same informal approach that had served me so well. Rather than starting with recipes and measurements, I focused on helping them develop their senses and judgment. We would taste ingredients separately before combining them, discuss how different cooking methods affected texture and flavor, and experiment with variations on familiar dishes.\n\nI have come to believe that this traditional approach to learning cooking—through observation, participation, and gradual assumption of responsibility—creates not just competent cooks but people who understand food and cooking in a deeper, more intuitive way. The kitchen wisdom that my grandmother spoke of was not just about techniques and recipes but about understanding cooking as a fundamental human activity that connects us to our families, our cultures, and our own creativity.\n\nLooking back, I realize that my grandmother and mother were teaching me far more than cooking skills. They were passing on a way of approaching problems, of learning through practice, and of finding creative solutions within practical constraints. These lessons have served me well not just in the kitchen but in many other areas of my life where flexibility, judgment, and the ability to adapt to changing circumstances have proven essential.",

As a body passes through a loop, its motion changes from prograde to retrograde and back.\n\nHypothesis 2: The Sun is the central body, and planets move in elliptical orbits around the Sun.

The teacher asked the students to base their predictions on one or both of the following equations:\n\nE = h × f, where h always has the same value\nv_light = f × λ\n\nStudent 1:\nWhen light enters the glass, f and E are unchanged. This occurs because light loses no energy when it collides with atoms of the glass. However, v_light becomes less than c (the speed of light in a vacuum, 3 × 10⁸ m/sec) due to these collisions, so λ must also decrease.\n\nAs the light leaves the glass, both f and E are still unchanged. But upon reentering the vacuum, v_light once again becomes c, so λ must increase.\n\nStudent 2:\nWhen light enters the glass, both f and E decrease, because light loses energy when it collides with atoms of the glass. In addition, v_light decreases due to these collisions, so the product f × λ must also decrease. However, λ can either decrease or increase, so long as any increase in λ is not so great as to cause f × λ to increase.\n\nWhen the light leaves the glass, neither f nor E changes, because there is nothing present in a vacuum that will cause f or E to increase. But v_light increases to c, the speed of light in a vacuum, so λ must also increase.\n\nStudent 3:\nWhen light enters the glass, both f and E decrease, because light loses energy when it collides with atoms of the glass. However, v_light becomes greater than c due to the gravitational attraction between the glass atoms and the light, so the product f × λ must also increase. Thus, λ must increase, and its increase must be great enough to overcome the decrease in f.\n\nAs the light leaves the glass, f and E will have the same values as they had inside the glass, because there is nothing present in a vacuum that will cause f and E to change. However, because of the gravitational attraction between the glass atoms and the light, v_light decreases to c, so λ must also decrease.",

Each harmonic has a characteristic number of nodes: locations between the ends of the string that do not move (the ends of the string do not count as nodes).\n\nA string having a mass per unit length of μ was attached on one end to an oscillator (a motor that vibrates) and on the other end to a pulley and ratchet. The student could select the frequency, f (the number of cycles per second), of the oscillator's vibration. By cranking the ratchet, the student could vary the force of tension, T, in the string.\n\nExperiment 1\nWith 0.10 newtons (N) of tension in String X (μ = 0.02 g/cm), the student varied f. She noted that standing waves occurred only at certain values of f. The student sketched the first 5 harmonics and recorded f (in hertz, Hz) for each. She repeated this procedure for String Y (μ = 0.08 g/cm) and for String Z (μ = 0.16 g/cm).\n\nExperiment 2\nBeginning again with String X, the student set the oscillator to vibrate at f = 25.0 Hz.

This viewpoint stresses that fossil fuel combustion is the dominant human activity causing climate change.\n\nViewpoint 2: Multiple Factors Approach\nOther scientists argue that while CO₂ is important, other greenhouse gases like methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) have much higher heat-trapping potential per molecule.

Each cylinder had an open end and a closed end; its open end was pushed into the soil, and then its aboveground surface was covered with shiny foil (see Figure 1). That same day, a gas sample was taken from each cylinder by inserting the needle of a 50 cm³ syringe into the closed end (through an airtight seal). The CH₄ content of each gas sample was determined. Likewise, on the 15th day of June, July, August, and September, a gas sample was taken from each cylinder and its CH₄ content was determined.\n\nThe difference in the CH₄ contents of consecutive samples (for example, the samples taken on May 15 and June 15) from a cylinder indicated whether there had been a net production of CH₄ (more CH₄ had been produced than consumed) or a net consumption of CH₄ (more CH₄ had been consumed than produced) in the area over the month between the 2 sampling dates. From these differences, the average rate of CH₄ production or consumption was calculated, in milligrams per square meter per day (mg/m²/day), for each area over each month (see Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2 shows average rate of CH₄ production or consumption (mg/m²/day) for the four areas across the months ending June 15, July 15, August 15, and September 15.

Once released, the cube oscillates between Points P and R, each a distance A (the amplitude) from Point Q.\n\nThe frequency, f, is the number of times per second the cube completes a cycle (travels from P to R, then back to P); v is the average speed of the cube during 1 cycle.\n\nThe teacher asks each of 3 students to predict which combination of the independent variables k, M, and A would produce the highest f.\n\nStudent 1: As k increases, v decreases, because a stiffer spring moves less freely. Therefore, f decreases because it takes more time for the cube to complete each cycle. As M increases, v decreases, and so f also decreases. As A increases, v increases, because the distance the cube travels during a complete cycle increases. Therefore, f also increases. The highest f would be produced when each of k and M has its least value and A has its greatest value.\n\nStudent 2: As k increases, v increases, because the force exerted on the cube by the spring also increases, giving the cube a greater average acceleration and, therefore, a greater v. When v increases, f increases. As M increases, v and f increase, because during the spring's oscillations, the momentum of the cube keeps its average speed from decreasing. As A increases, the force exerted on the cube by the spring increases, so v, f, and average acceleration increase. The highest f would be produced when each of k, M, and A has its greatest value.\n\nStudent 3: As k increases, the potential energy stored in the spring just before its release increases, so both v and f also increase. As M increases, the cube's average acceleration decreases, and so both v and f decrease. As A increases, both the cube's average acceleration and v increase, but so does the total distance through which the cube must travel. Consequently, f remains the same.

        "introduction": null,
        "passage_text": "In a particular playa (relatively flat, dry desert basin) evidence shows that some large rocks have moved along the surface, leaving shallow trails in the clay sediment, some up to several hundred meters long. Three scientists provided explanations for how these rocks moved.\n\nScientist 1:\nIn the spring, snowmelt from surrounding mountains runs downhill and collects in the playa. At night, cold temperatures cause this water to freeze around the rocks. When temperatures rise again, the ice begins to melt, leaving a layer of mud on the surface and ice \"rafts\" around the rocks. The buoyancy of the ice rafts floats the rocks on top of the mud such that even light winds can then push the rocks along the surface. Evidence of this lifting is seen in that the trails left by rocks are both shallow and only about 2/3 as wide as the rocks themselves. Due to the combination of ice, mud, and light winds, the rocks are able to move several hundred meters in a few days.\n\nScientist 2:\nSnowmelt from surrounding mountains does collect in the playa during the spring. However, the temperature in the playa does not get cold enough for ice to form. When the playa's surface gets wet, the top layer of clay transforms into a slick, muddy film. In addition, dormant algae present in the dry clay begin to grow rapidly when the clay becomes wet. The presence of mud and algae reduces friction between the rocks and the clay. Even so, relatively strong winds are required to push the rocks along the wet surface, forming trails. Due to the combination of mud, algae, and strong winds, the rocks are able to move several hundred meters in a few hours.\n\nScientist 3:\nWater does collect in the playa, producing mud and ice. However, neither mud nor ice is responsible for the rocks' movements. The playa is located along a fault line between tectonic plates. Minor vertical shifts in the plates cause the rocks to move downhill, leaving trails. Due to the combination of tectonic plate movement and strong winds, the rocks are able to move only a few meters over several years.",

        "passage_text": "When certain substances are added to diet cola, CO2 gas is produced, generating a foam. Two experiments were done to study this process.\n\nIn each trial, an apparatus like that shown in Figure 1 was used as follows: A jar was nearly filled with H2O and fitted with a 2-holed lid. One end of a tube (Tube B) was inserted through one of the holes and submerged. The other end of Tube B was placed in an empty graduated cylinder. Another tube (Tube A) was inserted through the other hole in the lid. A certain solid substance was inserted into the other end of Tube A, and the substance was secured by a clamp. Tube A was then attached to a freshly opened bottle containing 355 mL of diet cola. The clamp was removed, releasing the substance into the diet cola. The foam that was produced traveled into the jar, and liquid was transferred into the cylinder. The mass of CO2 produced was calculated based on the volume of liquid that was measured in the cylinder after foaming had ceased.\n\nExperiment 1:\nIn each of Trials 1-4, a different 1 of 4 substances of equal mass—a piece of chalk, a sugar cube, a fruit-flavored piece of candy, or a mint-flavored piece of candy—was added to a bottle of diet cola at 3°C.\n\nTable 1 shows volume of liquid in cylinder (mL) and mass of CO2 produced (g) for each trial:\nTrial 1 (chalk): 699 mL, 1.36 g\nTrial 2 (sugar cube): 570 mL, 1.11 g\nTrial 3 (fruit candy): 525 mL, 1.02 g\nTrial 4 (mint candy): 631 mL, 1.23 g\n\nExperiment 2:\nIn each of Trials 5-8, Trial 4 from Experiment 1 was repeated, except that the temperature of the diet cola was different in each trial.\n\nTable 2 shows temperature (°C), volume of liquid in cylinder (mL), and mass of CO2 produced (g):\nTrial 5: 10°C, 598 mL, 1.13 g\nTrial 6: 25°C, 539 mL, 0.969 g\nTrial 7: 45°C, 501 mL, 0.844 g\nTrial 8: 60°C, 476 mL, 0.766 g",

Equilibrium can be shifted forward or backward by changing the temperature, pressure, or concentration of reactants or products.\n\nTwo experiments were done using an apparatus with a reactor and condenser. In each trial, Steps 1-4 occurred:\n1. A fresh catalyst (Catalyst W, X, Y, or Z), 160 kg of H2, and 745 kg of N2 were placed in the reactor.\n2.

If a plant receives less than 8 hr of sunlight each day, it does not produce this purple pigment, so its stem is green. All plants in Population A are genetically identical, so they all have the ability to produce both pigments.\n\nStudent 2\nAll plants in Population A produce the green pigment chlorophyll. If a plant receives too little phosphorus (a nutrient), it also produces a purple pigment, causing its stem to be purple. If a plant receives enough phosphorus, it does not produce this purple pigment, so its stem is green.

Amino acids can be produced through chemical reactions among ammonia (NH₃), methane (CH₄), hydrogen (H₂), and water (H₂O). Four hypotheses have been proposed to describe the conditions that were responsible for the production of amino acids on Earth.\n\nHypothesis 1\nAmino acids were introduced to Earth by meteors containing NH₃, CH₄, H₂, and H₂O. If the reactions among these 4 substances are provided enough energy, amino acids can be produced. As meteors containing these substances entered Earth's atmosphere, the substances were rapidly heated by friction, and this heat resulted in immediate amino acid production on the surface of the meteors.\n\nHypothesis 2\nHypothesis 1 is correct that meteors brought NH₃, CH₄, H₂, and H₂O to Earth; however, amino acid production did not occur on the meteors. Once a meteor containing these substances entered Earth's atmosphere, the substances were released into the atmosphere. Meteors continued to enter the atmosphere over hundreds of millions of years. The concentration of these substances in the atmosphere eventually became high enough for the reactions that produce amino acids to occur. The energy provided to these reactions was UV light energy from the sun.\n\nHypothesis 3\nMeteors had nothing to do with the production of amino acids. Thermal vents (cracks in the floors of Earth's oceans) allowed magma from Earth's crust to seep into the ocean. The magma caused some of the ocean water to boil. Since ocean water contains dissolved NH₃, CH₄, and H₂, these substances were released into the atmosphere (along with H₂O) upon boiling. Then, UV light from the sun provided the energy for these substances to react to produce amino acids.\n\nHypothesis 4\nMagma from thermal vents did not provide enough energy to cause ocean water to boil; however, the magma did provide enough energy to cause the NH₃, CH₄, and H₂ dissolved in ocean water to react with the ocean water, producing amino acids. These reactions occurred near the thermal vents.",

Unlike traditional science tests that assess memorized content knowledge, the ACT Science section primarily measures your scientific reasoning and data interpretation skills.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">With only 35 minutes to answer 40 questions across 6-7 passages, you must work quickly and efficiently while maintaining accuracy. This lesson introduces the fundamental structure of the Science section, explains what skills are actually being tested, and provides a roadmap for approaching this challenging but highly manageable section of the ACT.</p> <h3 style=\"margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;\"> 1. Understanding the Science Section Format </h3> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">The ACT Science section is the fourth and final section of the test, consisting of 6-7 passages with 40 total questions. You have exactly 35 minutes to complete all questions, which translates to approximately 5 minutes per passage.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Understanding the structure, passage types, and time constraints is essential for developing an effective strategy that maximizes your score.</p> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Section Timing and Passage Distribution </h4> <ul style=\"margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;\"><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">40 questions:<ul style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;\"><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">. The number of questions per passage varies depending on the passage type</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">most passages have 5-6 questions, but the Conflicting Viewpoints passage typically has 7 questions. This means you have approximately 52.5 seconds per question, but in practice, you need to account for the time required to read and understand passages, study figures</li></ul></li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">analyze data. The strict time limit makes the Science section one of the most time-pressured parts of the ACT. Many students report that their biggest challenge is finishing all passages within the allotted time, which is why developing efficient reading and data analysis strategies is crucial.</li></ul> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> The Three Passage Types </h4> <ul style=\"margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;\"><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\"><strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">Data Representation:</strong> (2-3 passages with 5 questions each)</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\"><strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">Research Summaries:</strong> (3-4 passages with 6 questions each), and</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">Conflicting Viewpoints:<ul style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;\"><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">(1 passage with 7 questions). Data Representation passages present scientific information through graphs</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">and diagrams with minimal text</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">testing your ability to extract and analyze data. Research Summaries passages describe one or more experiments</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">testing your understanding of experimental design</li></ul></li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">results. Conflicting Viewpoints passages present two or more scientists or students discussing different hypotheses or theories about the same phenomenon, testing your ability to compare and contrast scientific perspectives. Recognizing these passage types immediately helps you adjust your reading strategy and know what to expect.</li></ul> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Content Areas Covered </h4> <ul style=\"margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;\"><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">Earth/space sciences:<ul style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;\"><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">. Topics might include genetics, ecology, chemical reactions, atomic structure, motion and forces, electricity, geology, meteorology, astronomy, and more. However, the ACT does not expect you to have memorized extensive science content</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">nearly all information needed to answer questions is provided in the passage itself. The section primarily tests your ability to interpret data, understand experimental methods</li></ul></li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">apply basic scientific reasoning rather than recall specific facts. That said, having a general familiarity with basic science concepts (like understanding what pH measures, knowing that temperature affects reaction rates, or recognizing common scientific units) can help you work more efficiently.</li></ul> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Scoring and Performance Expectations </h4> <ul style=\"margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;\"><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\"><strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">raw score:</strong> (0-40), which is then converted to a</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">scaled score: from 1-36. The conversion table varies slightly from test to test to account for difficulty differences</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">generally, missing 2-3 questions can still yield a score in the 33-35 range, while missing 6-8 questions typically results in a score around 28-30. There is</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">no penalty for wrong answers: so you should always guess if you're running out of time. The Science section is often considered one of the most improvable sections of the ACT because success depends more on test-taking strategies and data interpretation skills than on extensive content knowledge</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">Students who initially struggle with timing often see significant score improvements after learning efficient passage navigation techniques and question-answering strategies.</li></ul> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Example: Section Breakdown Typical Science section structure: - Data Representation passages: 2-3 passages × 5 questions = 10-15 questions - Research Summaries passages: 3-4 passages × 6 questions = 18-24 questions - Conflicting Viewpoints passage: 1 passage × 7 questions = 7 questions Total: 6-7 passages with 40 questions in 35 minutes. Recommended pacing: 5 minutes per passage, with flexibility to spend more time on complex passages and less on straightforward ones.</p> <h3 style=\"margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;\"> 2. What the Science Section Actually Tests </h3> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Despite its name, the ACT Science section is better understood as a scientific reasoning test rather than a traditional science knowledge test. The section assesses three main skill categories: Interpretation of Data, Scientific Investigation, and Evaluation of Models, Inferences, and Experimental Results.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Understanding these skill categories helps you recognize what each question is asking and how to approach it strategically.</p> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Interpretation of Data (40-50% of questions) </h4> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Interpretation of Data questions test your ability to read graphs and tables, identify trends, extract specific values, and interpolate or extrapolate data. You might be asked to determine what temperature corresponds to a specific pressure value from a graph, identify whether two variables have a positive or inverse relationship, or predict what would happen if an experiment continued beyond the data shown.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">These questions require careful attention to axis labels, units, scales, and legends. Common question stems include:.</p><ul style=\"margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;\"><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">\"According to Figure 1, what was the pH when temperature was 40°C?\", \"Based on Table 2, as concentration increased</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">reaction rate:<ul style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;\"><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">or \"If the experiment had continued</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">the mass at 60 seconds would most likely have been:\"</li></ul></li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">Success on these questions comes from methodically reading data representations and avoiding careless errors like misreading scales or confusing which variable is which</li></ul> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Scientific Investigation (20-30% of questions) </h4> <ul style=\"margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;\"><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\"><strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">Scientific Investigation:</strong> questions test your understanding of</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">scientific methodology:<ul style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;\"><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">. You need to identify which variables were manipulated (independent variables)</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">which were measured (dependent variables)</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">which were held constant (control variables)</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">and what the purpose of specific experimental procedures was. Questions might ask: \"Which variable was directly manipulated by the researchers?\"</li></ul></li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">\"What was the purpose of Trial 1?\", \"Which of the following would be the best way to extend this experiment?\", or \"What hypothesis was being tested in Experiment 2?\" These questions assess whether you understand how scientific experiments are structured and how scientists test hypotheses systematically. Strong performance requires understanding the logic behind experimental design and recognizing the difference between correlation and causation.</li></ul> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Evaluation of Models, Inferences, and Experimental Results (30-40% of questions) </h4> <ul style=\"margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;\"><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\"><strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">Evaluation:</strong> questions test your ability to</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">evaluate whether evidence supports a hypothesis:<ul style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;\"><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">. These questions require higher-order thinking and often involve synthesizing information from multiple sources within a passage. You might be asked: \"Based on the results of Experiments 1 and 2</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">which conclusion is best supported?\"</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">\"Which hypothesis is consistent with the data in Table 3?\"</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">\"Student 1 would most likely agree with which statement?\"</li></ul></li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">or \"What additional information would help determine which theory is correct?\" These questions are typically more challenging because they require you to go beyond simply reading data and instead think critically about what the data means, what assumptions underlie different viewpoints, and what logical conclusions can be drawn. Success requires careful reasoning and avoiding common pitfalls like choosing answers that sound plausible but aren't actually supported by the passage.</li></ul> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> The Minimal Role of Outside Knowledge </h4> <ul style=\"margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;\"><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">One of the most important things to understand about the ACT Science section is that it requires minimal outside content knowledge.</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">The vast majority of questions can be answered using only the information provided in the passage, figures, and tables. You might encounter 1-3 questions per test that require basic scientific knowledge (such as knowing that water boils at 100°C at standard pressure, understanding that photosynthesis produces oxygen, or recognizing common lab equipment), but these represent a very small percentage of total questions.</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">In fact, trying to apply outside knowledge can sometimes lead you astray if you make assumptions that contradict the passage's specific setup.</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">The best approach is to trust the passage and base your answers on what is explicitly stated or clearly implied by the data.</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">Students with limited science coursework can still achieve excellent scores by focusing on data interpretation and reasoning skills rather than worrying about content gaps..</li></ul> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Example: Skill Category Breakdown In a typical 40-question Science section: - 16-20 questions test Interpretation of Data (reading graphs, identifying trends, extracting values) - 8-12 questions test Scientific Investigation (experimental design, variables, controls) - 12-16 questions test Evaluation (drawing conclusions, analyzing viewpoints, making inferences) Knowing this distribution helps you understand where to focus your practice and what skills matter most for a high score. The majority of questions test data interpretation and evaluation skills rather than memorized science facts.</p> <h3 style=\"margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;\"> 3. Common Misconceptions About the Science Section </h3> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Many students approach the Science section with incorrect assumptions that hinder their performance. Understanding and correcting these misconceptions is crucial for developing an effective strategy and avoiding common pitfalls that prevent students from reaching their scoring potential.</p> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Misconception #1: You Need Extensive Science Knowledge </h4> <ul style=\"margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;\"><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">scientific reasoning and data interpretation skills:<ul style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;\"><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">not memorized content. Students who have taken Advanced Placement science courses don't necessarily score higher than students with basic science coursework if they haven't developed strong graph-reading and analytical skills. The passage provides all necessary context</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">definitions</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">and background information. Your job is to</li></ul></li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\"><strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">apply logical reasoning:</strong> not recall obscure scientific facts. In fact, overthinking questions by trying to apply outside knowledge often leads students to incorrect answers when they should simply trust what the passage explicitly states. Focus on developing strong data analysis skills rather than cramming science content.</li></ul> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Misconception #2: You Must Read Every Word of Text </h4> <ul style=\"margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;\"><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\"><strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">strategic skimming approach:</strong> quickly reading the introduction to understand the general topic, focusing primarily on</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">figures and tables: and only reading detailed text when needed to answer specific questions. The figures often contain the most important information</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">paragraphs of text frequently just explain procedures in more detail than necessary. Learning to</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">prioritize visual data:<ul style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;\"><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">over lengthy descriptions can save significant time. However, this doesn't mean ignoring text entirely</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">you need to read enough to understand what was studied and what the variables represent, but you don't need to memorize every procedural detail</li></ul></li></ul> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Misconception #3: Harder Science Topics Mean Harder Questions </h4> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Students often feel intimidated when they see passages about unfamiliar or complex-sounding topics like \"polymerase chain reaction\" or \"superconductivity.\" However, passage topic complexity does not correlate with question difficulty. A passage about a sophisticated physics concept might have straightforward questions that simply ask you to read values from a graph, while a passage about a simple experiment with plants might have challenging questions that require synthesizing information from multiple trials.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">The ACT deliberately uses technical-sounding topics to test whether you can stay focused and confident when faced with unfamiliar material. Don't let intimidating vocabulary or advanced-sounding topics psyche you out.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">The questions are designed to be answerable regardless of your prior knowledge of the specific topic. Stay calm, focus on the data, and trust that all necessary information is provided.</p> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Misconception #4: The Passages Must Be Completed in Order </h4> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Many students assume they must work through Science passages in the order they appear, but this is not a requirement. In fact, strategic passage selection can improve both your score and confidence.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Some students find Data Representation passages faster and easier because they focus primarily on graphs with minimal text, so they tackle those first to bank time for more complex passages. Others prefer starting with Research Summaries because they find the experimental format more intuitive.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Still others save the Conflicting Viewpoints passage for last because it has the most text and different question types. You can also preview passages quickly and identify which ones look most straightforward based on figure complexity and text length.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Experiment during practice to find an order that maximizes your efficiency. Just be careful to bubble answers in the correct spots on your answer sheet when you skip around.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Example: Correcting Misconceptions in Practice Before: \"I need to read every word carefully and I'm worried because I haven't taken AP Chemistry yet.\" After: \"I'll focus primarily on the figures and tables, skim the text for context, and trust that all information I need is in the passage. My score depends on data interpretation skills, not memorized content.\" This mindset shift alone can lead to significant time savings and reduced anxiety, allowing you to work more efficiently and confidently through Science passages.</p> <h3 style=\"margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;\"> 4. Building Your Science Section Foundation </h3> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Success on the ACT Science section requires developing a systematic approach that combines efficient passage navigation, strong data interpretation skills, strategic time management, and focused practice. This section introduces foundational concepts and habits that will support your improvement across all Science question types.</p> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Developing a Passage Attack Strategy </h4> <ul style=\"margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;\"><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">quickly reading the introduction to understand what phenomenon or question is being studied</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">examining all figures and tables to understand what variables are being measured and what trends are visible</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">skimming any experimental descriptions to identify how trials differ from each other, and</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">moving to the questions, referring back to specific parts of the passage as needed.</li></ul>\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">This approach prioritizes the most important information (the data itself) while avoiding getting bogged down in procedural details. However, you should experiment with variations during practice to find what works best for your reading style and strengths.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Some students prefer reading questions first to know what to look for, while others find this disruptive. Find your optimal approach through deliberate practice.</p> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Mastering Figure and Table Analysis </h4> <ul style=\"margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;\"><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\"><strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">graphs, tables, and diagrams:</strong> developing strong figure-reading skills is essential.

The ACT consists of four required sections—English, Math, Reading, and Science—plus an optional Writing section. This lesson will give you a complete overview of the test format, teach you how scores work, and provide strategic insights to help you maximize your performance on test day. </p> <h3 style=\"margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;\"> 1. Test Structure and Format </h3> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> The ACT is a <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">standardized test</strong> used by colleges for admissions decisions. Unlike the SAT, the ACT tests more straightforward knowledge and has a <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">Science section</strong>. The test is divided into four required sections and one optional section, with a total testing time of about 3 hours (or 3.5 hours with Writing). </p> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> English Section: 45 Minutes, 75 Questions </h4> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> The <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">English section</strong> tests grammar, punctuation, sentence structure, and rhetorical skills across five passages. You'll have approximately 45 seconds per question. Questions test conventions of standard English (grammar and usage), production of writing (strategy and organization), and knowledge of language (style and tone). This section appears first on the test, so starting strong is crucial for building confidence. </p> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Math Section: 60 Minutes, 60 Questions </h4> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> The <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">Math section</strong> covers pre-algebra, elementary algebra, intermediate algebra, coordinate geometry, plane geometry, and trigonometry. You have one minute per question on average. A <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">reference sheet</strong> with basic formulas is provided, but memorizing key formulas will save time. Calculators are permitted (and highly recommended) for this entire section. </p> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Reading Section: 35 Minutes, 40 Questions </h4> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> The <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">Reading section</strong> includes four passages: Prose Fiction/Literary Narrative, Social Science, Humanities, and Natural Science. Each passage has 10 questions. You'll have about 8 minutes and 45 seconds per passage, so time management is critical. Questions test your ability to determine main ideas, locate details, understand sequences, make comparisons, comprehend cause-effect relationships, determine word meaning, and analyze author's voice and method. </p> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Science Section: 35 Minutes, 40 Questions </h4> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> The <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">Science section</strong> tests interpretation, analysis, evaluation, reasoning, and problem-solving skills through data representation, research summaries, and conflicting viewpoints passages. Don't worry—you don't need advanced science knowledge! The section primarily tests your ability to read graphs, charts, and tables, and apply scientific reasoning. Most students find this section challenging due to the pace (about 53 seconds per question). </p> <h3 style=\"margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;\"> 2. Scoring System and What Scores Mean </h3> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> Understanding how the ACT is scored helps you set realistic goals and track your progress. The ACT uses a <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">scaled scoring system</strong> from 1-36, and there's <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">no penalty for wrong answers</strong>, so you should always guess if you're running out of time. </p> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> How Scores Are Calculated </h4> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> Each section (English, Math, Reading, Science) receives a <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">scaled score</strong> from 1-36 based on the number of questions you answer correctly (your <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">raw score</strong>). These four section scores are then averaged to create your <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">Composite Score</strong>, which is the most important number for college admissions. The composite is rounded to the nearest whole number—for example, if your four section scores are 28, 30, 26, and 32, your composite is (28+30+26+32)/4 = 29. </p> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> What's a Good Score? </h4> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> The national average composite score is around <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">20-21</strong>. A score of 24 puts you in approximately the 75th percentile, meaning you scored higher than 75% of test-takers. Competitive colleges typically want scores above 27, while highly selective schools (Ivy League, top liberal arts colleges) generally expect 32-36. However, \"good\" depends on your target schools—research the average ACT scores for admitted students at colleges you're interested in. </p> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Subscores and STEM Score </h4> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> In addition to section scores, you'll receive <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">subscores</strong> (1-18 scale) for specific skill areas like \"Production of Writing\" in English or \"Integrating Essential Skills\" in Math. You'll also see a <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">STEM score</strong>, which averages your Math and Science scores. While colleges primarily focus on your composite and individual section scores, subscores can help identify specific areas for improvement. </p> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Superscoring </h4> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> Many colleges practice <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">superscoring</strong>, which means they take your highest section scores across multiple test dates and recalculate a new composite. For example, if you score English 28, Math 30, Reading 25, Science 27 on Test 1, then English 26, Math 32, Reading 28, Science 26 on Test 2, your superscore would combine the best from each: 28, 32, 28, 27 = composite 28.75, rounded to 29. Check whether your target colleges superscore—this policy encourages retaking the ACT to improve individual sections. </p> <h3 style=\"margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;\"> 3. General Test-Taking Strategies </h3> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> Success on the ACT requires more than content knowledge—you need effective <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">time management</strong>, <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">strategic guessing</strong>, and <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">stress management</strong> skills. These universal strategies apply across all four sections. </p> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Always Answer Every Question </h4> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> The ACT has <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">no guessing penalty</strong>—wrong answers don't count against you. This means you should NEVER leave a question blank. If you're running out of time, quickly bubble in an answer for every remaining question. Statistically, random guessing gives you about a 20-25% chance of being correct, which is better than 0%! </p> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Pace Yourself and Use a Watch </h4> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> Time pressure is one of the ACT's biggest challenges. Wear a <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">watch</strong> (analog watches are best since digital devices aren't allowed) and set checkpoints. For example, in Reading, you should finish passage 1 by minute 8, passage 2 by minute 17, passage 3 by minute 26, and passage 4 by minute 35. Don't spend too long on any single question—if you're stuck after 30-45 seconds, make your best guess, circle it in the test booklet, and move on. You can return if time permits. </p> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Answer Easy Questions First </h4> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> Not all questions are created equal. Some are straightforward, while others require complex reasoning. Within each section, scan for <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">\"quick points\"</strong>—questions you can answer confidently in 20-30 seconds. Rack up these easy points first, then tackle harder questions with your remaining time. This strategy maximizes your score even if time runs out. </p> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Process of Elimination </h4> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> When you're unsure of the correct answer, use <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">process of elimination</strong>. Cross out answers you know are wrong in your test booklet, then guess among remaining choices. Eliminating even one wrong answer improves your odds from 20% to 25% (for 4-choice questions) or 25% to 33% (for 3-choice questions). Often you can <span class=\"glossary-term\" style=\"color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;\" title=\"Cross out wrong answer choices\">eliminate</span> 2-3 choices, giving you a strong chance of guessing correctly. </p> <h3 style=\"margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;\"> 4. Test Day Preparation and Logistics </h3> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> Your performance on test day depends not only on preparation but also on practical considerations like what to bring, how to manage stress, and what to expect at the testing center. Being well-prepared logistically helps you focus entirely on the test itself. </p> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> What to Bring </h4> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> Mandatory items: your <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">admission ticket</strong> (printed from your ACT account) and an acceptable <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">photo ID</strong> (school ID, driver's license, or passport). Recommended items: several sharpened No. 2 pencils with erasers, an approved <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">calculator</strong> with fresh batteries, a watch (not a smartwatch), snacks and water for breaks, and layered clothing in case the room is too hot or cold. Do NOT bring: cell phones, smartwatches, prohibited calculators, reference materials, or scratch paper (you can use the test booklet). </p> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Night Before and Morning Of </h4> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> The night before: review a few key formulas or grammar rules, but don't cram—it's more important to get <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">8 hours of sleep</strong>. Pack your backpack with everything you'll need. Set multiple alarms. The morning of: eat a substantial, protein-rich breakfast (avoid sugary foods that cause energy crashes). Arrive at the test center by 7:45 AM for an 8:00 AM start—latecomers aren't admitted. Use the bathroom before testing begins, as breaks are limited. </p> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Managing Test Anxiety </h4> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> Feeling nervous is normal, but excessive <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">test anxiety</strong> can hurt your performance. Practice <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">deep breathing</strong> techniques: inhale slowly for 4 counts, hold for 4 counts, exhale for 4 counts. During the test, if you feel overwhelmed, close your eyes for 10 seconds, take a deep breath, and refocus. Remember: you can retake the ACT—this one test doesn't define you. Confidence comes from preparation, so thorough practice with realistic timed tests is your best defense against anxiety. </p> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> After the Test </h4> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> Scores are typically released 2-8 weeks after your test date (check your ACT account for the exact release date). You can send your scores to colleges for free on test day (list up to 4 schools), or pay later to send additional score reports. Many students take the ACT 2-3 times to improve their composite score—each attempt gives you new experience and insights. Review your score report carefully to identify weak areas, then create a targeted study plan for your next attempt. </p> <p style=\"height: 1px; margin: 0; padding: 0;\"></p><h3 style=\"margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700; visibility: hidden; height: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0; overflow: hidden;\">.</h3><h3 style=\"color: #2e7d32; font-size: 1.4rem; font-weight: 700; margin: 3rem 0 1.5rem 0;\"> Key Takeaways </h3> <ul style=\"list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;\"> <li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;\">\n    <span style=\"color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;\">✓</span>The ACT has four sections: English , Math , Reading , Science .\n  </li> <li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;\">\n    <span style=\"color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;\">✓</span>Scores range from 1-36 per section; your Composite is the average of all four sections.\n  </li> <li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;\">\n    <span style=\"color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;\">✓</span>There's no guessing penalty—ALWAYS answer every question, even if you have to guess.\n  </li> <li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;\">\n    <span style=\"color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;\">✓</span>Time management is crucial: use a watch, set checkpoints.\n  </li> <li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;\">\n    <span style=\"color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;\">✓</span>Many colleges superscore—taking the ACT multiple times can improve your composite.\n  </li> <li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;\">\n    <span style=\"color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;\">✓</span>Test day essentials: admission ticket, photo ID, No.\n  </li> </ul></body></html>",

Systematic Error Recognition Strategies </h3> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> Develop a consistent approach to every grammar question. This systematic method prevents you from missing errors and helps you work efficiently under time pressure. </p> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Step 1: Read the Sentence Completely </h4> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> Always read from the beginning of the sentence (or previous sentence if needed) through the end. Context matters—you can't identify tense errors, pronoun agreement, or modifier placement without understanding the full sentence. </p> <div style=\"border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; background-color: #f8fafc;\"> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">Why this matters:</strong> Many errors depend on elements outside the underlined portion. Subject-verb agreement requires finding the subject (often not underlined). Verb tense requires checking surrounding verbs. Pronoun clarity requires seeing the antecedent. </p> </div> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Step 2: Trust Your Ear, But Verify with Rules </h4> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> If something sounds wrong, it probably is. However, some errors sound correct (like \"everyone...their\"), so verify with the rules you've learned. </p> <div style=\"border-left: 4px solid #16a34a; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; background-color: #f0fdf4;\"> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">Ear + Rules = Accuracy</strong> → If it sounds wrong: Identify which rule is violated → If it sounds right: Still check the Big 7 categories systematically </p> </div> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Step 3: Eliminate Obviously Wrong Answers </h4> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> Use process of elimination to narrow choices before identifying the specific error. </p> <div style=\"border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; background-color: #f8fafc;\"> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">Common eliminators:</strong> </p> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> • Creates a fragment or run-on • Uses wrong verb tense for the context • Creates pronoun agreement error • Breaks parallel structure in a list • Makes the sentence significantly more wordy without adding clarity </p> </div> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Step 4: Look for Visual Cues </h4> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> Certain patterns in the answer choices tell you what the question is testing. </p> <div style=\"border-left: 4px solid #f59e0b; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; background-color: #fffbeb;\"> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">Different punctuation marks?</strong> → Punctuation question <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">Different verb forms?</strong> → Verb agreement or tense <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">Different pronouns?</strong> → Pronoun agreement or case <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">Sentence restructured?</strong> → Modifier placement or sentence structure <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">Different word order in list?</strong> → Parallel structure </p> </div> <h3 style=\"margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;\"> 3. Time Management and Pacing </h3> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> The ACT English section gives you 45 minutes for 75 questions across 5 passages.

The key to mastering these questions is recognizing the connection between the figures—typically, you find a data point in the first figure, use that value to locate information in the second figure, and finally use that second piece of information to determine your answer.\n</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;\">\n1.

With only 35 minutes to read four passages and answer 40 questions, you must develop efficient reading techniques that balance speed with accuracy.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">This lesson provides a comprehensive overview of the Reading section structure, explains what skills are tested, introduces the four passage types you'll encounter, and outlines proven strategies for maximizing your score on this fast-paced section.</p> <h3 style=\"margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;\"> 1. Understanding the Reading Section Format </h3> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">The ACT Reading section is the third section of the test and consists of four passages with ten questions each. You have exactly 35 minutes to complete all 40 questions, which means approximately 8 minutes and 45 seconds per passage including both reading time and question-answering time.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Understanding the structure and format of this section is essential for developing an effective test-taking strategy.</p> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Section Timing and Question Distribution </h4> <ul style=\"margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;\"><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">40 questions: . Each passage is approximately 750-900 words long and accompanied by exactly 10 questions. Unlike some standardized tests where passages vary in difficulty, all four ACT Reading passages are designed to be roughly equivalent in challenge level</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">However, individual students may find certain passage types easier based on their interests and background knowledge. The strict time constraint—just over 8.5 minutes per passage—makes the Reading section one of the most time-pressured parts of the ACT. Most students report that finishing all four passages is their biggest challenge.</li></ul> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Passage Order and Organization </h4> <ul style=\"margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;\"><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\"><strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">Humanities:</strong> (third), and</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">Natural Science: (fourth). However, you are NOT required to complete the passages in this order. Strategic test-takers often rearrange the order to tackle their strongest passage types first, building confidence and banking time for more challenging passages later. Each passage is clearly labeled with its type, author information</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">sometimes a brief italicized introduction that provides context. Questions are numbered consecutively from 1-40 across all four passages (not 1-10 for each passage), so passage one has questions 1-10, passage two has questions 11-20, and so on.</li></ul> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Question Format and Answer Choices </h4> <ul style=\"margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;\"><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">four answer options: (A, B, C, D). Unlike the ACT English section which has three-choice questions</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">Reading questions always have four choices. Each question has exactly one correct answer, and there is</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">no penalty for guessing: —wrong answers do not subtract from your score. Questions appear to the right of the passage (or below it in the online format)</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">you can refer back to the passage as many times as needed. Most questions are passage-based, meaning you must find evidence in the text to support your answer. A few questions may ask about vocabulary in context or require you to make reasonable inferences based on textual clues.</li></ul> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Scoring and Raw-to-Scale Conversion </h4> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Your Reading section score is based on the number of questions you answer correctly, called your raw score. This raw score (0-40) is then converted to a scaled score from 1-36 using a conversion table that varies slightly from test to test to account for minor difficulty differences.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Generally, missing 2-3 questions still allows you to achieve a score in the 33-35 range, while missing 6-8 questions typically results in a score around 28-30. The conversion is designed so that a scaled score of 36 requires a perfect or near-perfect raw score (39-40 correct), while a scaled score of 20 (roughly average) corresponds to answering about 23-26 questions correctly.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Because the scoring curve is relatively generous at the top end, even high-achieving students can afford to miss a few questions and still receive excellent scores.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">Example: Section Breakdown</strong><br><br> Passage 1 (Prose Fiction): Questions 1-10 | ~8:45 minutes<br> Passage 2 (Social Science): Questions 11-20 | ~8:45 minutes<br> Passage 3 (Humanities): Questions 21-30 | ~8:45 minutes<br> Passage 4 (Natural Science): Questions 31-40 | ~8:45 minutes<br><br> Total: 40 questions in 35 minutes = approximately 52.5 seconds per question, but you must account for reading time as well, which is why the per-passage timing works better as a guide. </p> <h3 style=\"margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;\"> 2. The Four Passage Types Explained </h3> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Each ACT Reading section contains exactly four passages, each representing a different content area. Understanding the characteristics of each passage type helps you know what to expect and allows you to develop specialized strategies for each category.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">While the question types remain similar across all passages, the content, writing style, and focus differ significantly.</p> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Prose Fiction and Literary Narrative </h4> <ul style=\"margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;\"><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\"><strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">Prose Fiction/Literary Narrative:</strong> passage is always the first passage and features excerpts from short stories, novels, memoirs, or personal essays. These passages focus on</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">literary devices: . You'll need to understand character motivations, identify tone and mood, track plot developments, and interpret figurative language. Questions often ask about a character's emotions, the narrator's perspective, or the significance of specific events. Literary passages can be challenging because they require careful attention to nuance, subtext</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">implied meanings rather than just explicit facts. To succeed with fiction passages, pay attention to dialogue, character interactions, descriptive details, and shifts in tone or perspective.</li></ul> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Social Science </h4> <ul style=\"margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;\"><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\"><strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">Social Science:</strong> passage appears second and covers topics from anthropology, archaeology, biography, business, economics, education, geography, history, political science, psychology, and sociology. These passages present</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">theories: in an informative, expository style. Questions typically test your ability to identify main ideas, understand supporting details, recognize cause-and-effect relationships, and follow the author's argument or analysis</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">Social Science passages tend to be more straightforward than fiction because they explicitly state facts and conclusions rather than implying them. However, they may contain dense information that requires careful tracking of multiple concepts, names, dates, or statistics. Strong annotation and note-taking strategies are particularly useful for these passages.</li></ul> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Humanities </h4> <ul style=\"margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;\"><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\"><strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">Humanities:</strong> passage is third and includes content related to architecture, art, dance, ethics, film, language, literary criticism, music, philosophy, radio, television, and theater. These passages often discuss</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">critical analysis of creative works: . The writing style falls somewhere between Literary Narrative and Social Science—more personal and opinion-based than pure exposition but more analytical than storytelling</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">Questions may ask you to identify the author's perspective on an artist or movement, understand historical context, or recognize how the author supports their claims about cultural significance. Humanities passages sometimes include the author's personal reflections or evaluative judgments, so pay attention to distinguishing between objective facts and subjective opinions.</li></ul> <h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\"> Natural Science </h4> <ul style=\"margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;\"><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\"><strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">Natural Science:</strong> passage appears fourth and covers topics from anatomy, astronomy, biology, botany, chemistry, ecology, geology, medicine, meteorology, microbiology, natural history, physiology, physics, technology, and zoology. These passages explain</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">technological innovations: . The writing is typically expository and informative, similar to what you'd find in a science textbook or popular science magazine. Questions test whether you understand scientific processes, can identify cause-and-effect relationships, comprehend technical vocabulary in context</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">follow the logic of scientific explanations. Don't worry if you're not familiar with the specific scientific topic—all necessary information is provided in the passage. However, Natural Science passages can be challenging due to complex terminology, detailed descriptions of processes, and abstract concepts that require visualization.</li></ul> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Example: Passage Type Characteristics Prose Fiction: Focus on character emotions, narrative perspective, and literary themes.

The most successful students develop</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">active reading strategies: that allow them to extract essential information quickly while still retaining enough detail to answer questions accurately. This means learning to identify what's important (main ideas, key supporting details, author's purpose) versus what's less critical (minor examples, tangential descriptions) during your first read-through</li><li style=\"margin: 0.15rem 0;\">With practice, you can improve both your reading speed and comprehension simultaneously by training yourself to recognize patterns in passage structure and question types.</li></ul> <p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\"> <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">Example: Question Type Distribution</strong><br><br> In a typical Reading section:<br> - 22-24 questions test Key Ideas and Details (main ideas, supporting details, sequences, cause-effect)<br> - 10-12 questions test Craft and Structure (vocabulary, author's purpose, tone, point of view)<br> - 5-7 questions test Integration of Knowledge and Ideas (inferences, arguments, conclusions)<br><br> Knowing this distribution helps you anticipate what skills you'll need to apply most frequently and where to focus your practice efforts. </p> <h3 style=\"margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;\"> 4.

This lesson covers all the miscellaneous topics that don't fit neatly into other categories but have appeared on the ACT before. While none of these topics are commonly tested, they do show up occasionally—especially in the more difficult questions toward the end of the Math test. You should focus on this lesson only after you have mastered the other more commonly tested topics.
