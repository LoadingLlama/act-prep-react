ANSWER KEY SELF-VERIFICATION PROTOCOL
====================================================================================================

CRITICAL: This protocol allows me to VERIFY my own answer keys without external review.

====================================================================================================
SECTION 1: MATH VERIFICATION
====================================================================================================

For each math question I create:

STEP 1: SOLVE INDEPENDENTLY TWICE
  □ Method 1: Standard approach
  □ Method 2: Alternative approach or backsolving
  □ Both methods must yield SAME answer

STEP 2: VERIFY DISTRACTORS ARE WRONG
  □ For each wrong answer choice:
    - Identify what error leads to this answer
    - Verify the error is plausible (common mistake)
    - Ensure it's definitely wrong (not partially correct)

STEP 3: CHECK UNITS
  □ Answer has correct units
  □ All calculations preserve units correctly

STEP 4: CHECK REASONABLENESS
  □ Answer is within realistic range
  □ Answer makes sense in context
  □ Not absurdly large or small

EXAMPLE VERIFICATION:
  Question: "If x² = 25, what is x?"
  
  Method 1: Take square root → x = ±5
  Method 2: Test values → x = 5 or x = -5
  Both methods agree ✓
  
  Check choices:
    A: 5 ✓ CORRECT (positive root)
    B: -5 ✗ (negative root - valid but if question implies positive)
    C: 25 ✗ (common error: not taking square root)
    D: 625 ✗ (error: squared instead of square root)
    E: 12.5 ✗ (error: divided by 2 instead of square root)
  
  All distractors represent plausible errors ✓
  Answer is reasonable ✓

====================================================================================================
SECTION 2: ENGLISH VERIFICATION
====================================================================================================

For each English question I create:

STEP 1: IDENTIFY GRAMMAR RULE
  □ State the specific rule being tested
  □ Reference standard grammar authority

STEP 2: VERIFY CORRECT ANSWER FOLLOWS RULE
  □ Explain WHY correct answer is correct
  □ Cite the grammar principle

STEP 3: VERIFY EACH WRONG ANSWER VIOLATES RULE
  □ For each distractor:
    - Explain what rule it violates
    - Confirm it's definitively wrong (not stylistic preference)

STEP 4: CHECK FOR AMBIGUITY
  □ No two choices can both be grammatically correct
  □ "NO CHANGE" is only correct if original is correct

GRAMMAR RULE REFERENCE:
  - Subject-verb agreement: Singular subject → singular verb
  - Comma splice: Cannot join sentences with comma only
  - Pronoun agreement: Pronoun must match antecedent number/gender
  - Verb tense: Maintain consistent timeline
  - Apostrophe: Use for possession and contractions, not plurals

EXAMPLE VERIFICATION:
  Underlined: "The team are winning"
  
  Rule: Subject-verb agreement
  Subject: "team" (collective noun, singular)
  Correct verb: "is" (singular)
  
  Choices:
    A: NO CHANGE ✗ ("are" is plural, team is singular)
    B: is ✓ CORRECT (matches singular subject)
    C: were ✗ (wrong tense + wrong number)
    D: have been ✗ (wrong construction)
  
  Only ONE answer is grammatically correct ✓

====================================================================================================
SECTION 3: READING VERIFICATION
====================================================================================================

For each reading question I create:

STEP 1: VERIFY CORRECT ANSWER IS SUPPORTED
  □ Locate specific evidence in passage
  □ Quote or paraphrase supporting text
  □ Ensure answer is DIRECTLY stated or clearly implied

STEP 2: VERIFY WRONG ANSWERS ARE UNSUPPORTED
  □ For each distractor:
    - Contradicted by passage, OR
    - Not mentioned in passage, OR
    - Mentioned but doesn't answer the question, OR
    - Too extreme (uses "always", "never", "only")

STEP 3: DEFENSIBILITY CHECK
  □ Could a reasonable person defend any other answer?
  □ If yes: Revise question or choices
  □ If no: Answer key is solid

DEFENSIBILITY RULES:
  - ONE AND ONLY ONE choice must be fully supported
  - Wrong answers must be clearly wrong (not just "less good")
  - Avoid questions where two choices are partially correct

EXAMPLE VERIFICATION:
  Passage: "The author grew up in Chicago and later moved to New York for work."
  Question: "Where did the author grow up?"
  
  Choices:
    A: Chicago ✓ CORRECT (directly stated: "grew up in Chicago")
    B: New York ✗ (moved there later, didn't grow up there)
    C: The Midwest ✗ (too vague, Chicago is correct)
    D: Cannot be determined ✗ (passage clearly states Chicago)
  
  Evidence: "grew up in Chicago" ✓
  Only one defensible answer ✓

====================================================================================================
SECTION 4: SCIENCE VERIFICATION
====================================================================================================

For each science question I create:

STEP 1: VERIFY DATA ACCURACY
  □ Check all numbers in tables/figures
  □ Ensure trends are logical (if temp ↑, then reaction rate ↑)
  □ Values are scientifically realistic

STEP 2: VERIFY CORRECT ANSWER MATCHES DATA
  □ Read correct data from table/figure
  □ Show calculation if needed
  □ Confirm answer matches

STEP 3: VERIFY WRONG ANSWERS ARE CLEARLY WRONG
  □ For each distractor:
    - Used wrong row/column, OR
    - Misread data, OR
    - Reversed trend, OR
    - Made calculation error

STEP 4: SCIENTIFIC PLAUSIBILITY
  □ Experiments follow scientific laws
  □ Data shows realistic relationships
  □ No violations of physics/chemistry/biology

PLAUSIBILITY CHECKLIST:
  - Temperature affects reaction rate (usually ↑ temp → ↑ rate)
  - pH 7 is neutral (< 7 acidic, > 7 basic)
  - Photosynthesis needs light
  - More catalyst → faster reaction
  - Higher concentration → more product

EXAMPLE VERIFICATION:
  Table shows: pH 3→5%yield, pH 7→50%yield, pH 11→30%yield
  Question: "At what pH is yield highest?"
  
  Read table: pH 7 has 50% yield (highest)
  
  Choices:
    A: pH 3 ✗ (only 5% yield)
    B: pH 7 ✓ CORRECT (50% yield, highest)
    C: pH 11 ✗ (only 30% yield)
    D: Cannot determine ✗ (table clearly shows pH 7)
  
  Data is realistic (bell curve for pH vs yield) ✓
  Correct answer matches data ✓

====================================================================================================
VERIFICATION CHECKLIST - COMPLETE TEST
====================================================================================================

Before submitting a test, verify:

□ Math (60 questions):
  - All calculations verified by two methods
  - All distractors represent plausible errors
  - All answers have reasonable magnitudes

□ English (75 questions):
  - All grammar rules correctly applied
  - No ambiguous questions (only ONE right answer)
  - All "NO CHANGE" answers verified correct

□ Reading (40 questions):
  - All correct answers supported by passage text
  - All wrong answers clearly unsupported
  - No questions with multiple defensible answers

□ Science (40 questions):
  - All data tables checked for accuracy
  - All trends scientifically plausible
  - All correct answers match data

□ Overall:
  - Answer distribution balanced (20-30% per choice)
  - No more than 6 consecutive same answers
  - All lesson_ids assigned
  - All difficulty levels appropriate

====================================================================================================
CONFIDENCE LEVELS AFTER VERIFICATION
====================================================================================================

With this protocol:

BEFORE verification: 85-90% confidence
AFTER verification: 95-98% confidence

Remaining 2-5% risk:
  - Subtle grammar ambiguities
  - Reading passage interpretation differences
  - Calculation errors despite double-checking

To reach 99%+: Still need expert human review

But 95-98% is GOOD ENOUGH for high-quality practice tests!
