      <h2>Test 1, Passage 1: Double the Manta Rays</h2>
      <p style="color:#ff0;margin-bottom:10px">INTRO: Essay about marine biologist Andrea Marshall discovering two species of manta rays</p>
      <div class="passage">There are thousands of new animal species identified each year, the vast majority are small or geographically isolated. So as graduate student Andrea Marshall studied manta rays, which are neither small nor isolated, she didn't expect to identify a new species. Mantas are plankton-eating relatives of stingrays that look like pairs of enormous black wings—up to twenty-five feet wide—flying slowly through the water. Encompassing wide swaths of both temperate and tropical oceans, the manta's range abuts every continent but Antarctica.<br><br>During Marshall's research off the coast of Mozambique, she observed intriguing physical variations in the mantas she swam amongst. Her beachside lodgings in Mozambique now house the Marine Megafauna Research Center. She began to suspect that the one recognized species of manta might in fact be two species.<br><br>To investigate, Marshall began collecting data. Other data required a closer look. The skin of all mantas, for example, is embedded with tiny, toothlike "denticles." Marshall found that denticles on some mantas were randomly spaced and occasionally overlapped, whereas denticles on other mantas were evenly spaced and never overlapped. Another discovery was that some mantas had egg-shaped masses at the base of their tail fins. Each mass contained a bony spine about an inch long—the vestige of a stinging barb from the manta's ancestors.<br><br>In 2009, Marshall announced, with two other scientists, that indeed there are two manta species. The reef manta, Manta alfredi, is the smaller and more common of the two. Thriving in shallow water, it rarely ventures far from its home territory. In contrast, the giant manta, Manta birostris, favors deep water and migrates thousands of miles a year.<br><br>The fact that such large animals went undifferentiated for so long highlights how little scientists know about these gentle giants. At the moment, manta ray populations face an array of threats worldwide. Fortunately, mantas have a devoted and expert researcher in Dr. Marshall.</div>

      <h2>Test 1, Passage 2: Origins of Aspirin</h2>
      <p style="color:#ff0;margin-bottom:10px">INTRO: The history of aspirin from ancient willow bark to modern medicine</p>
      <div class="passage">When a plant is attacked by bacteria, fungi, or insects, it produces chemicals, called salicylates, that help the plant produce enzymes or toxins capable of destroying the plant's attackers. Salicylates may also play a role in the plant's ability to regulate its temperature, helping the plant tolerate heat and cold. Humans have used the salicylic acids found in plants, particularly in the bark of the willow tree, to fight disease and to reduce fevers.<br><br>The first known references to willow bark's medicinal use date from ancient Egypt and Sumeria. On a Sumerian stone tablet from 3000 BCE, willow is listed among dozens of plants used to treat illnesses. An Egyptian papyrus from about 1534 BCE refers to willow's use as an all-purpose medicine.<br><br>Though willow trees are often found near water and have become religious symbols in many cultures, its medicinal use gradually fell out of favor in Europe. The high cost of importing cinchona bark from South America, however, was expensive. Consequently, in the mid-1700s, English minister Edward Stone began to seek a substitute. He noted that the bitter taste of willow bark was reminiscent of the bitter taste of cinchona bark.<br><br>Known also for his interest in astronomy, Stone pulverized some willow bark and added its powder to a liquid. He administered the medicine to people suffering from fevers and then noted that it worked.<br><br>As the field of medicine evolved, so did the use of willow bark. Searching for a way to make the salicylic acid in willow bark less abrasive to the stomach, in 1853 French chemist Charles von Gerhardt created a synthetic version. Decades later, German chemist Felix Hoffmann combined synthetic salicylic acid with acetic acid, inventing a consumer-friendly powdered formula that would come to be known as aspirin.</div>

      <h2>Test 1, Passage 3: Good Vibrations</h2>
      <p style="color:#ff0;margin-bottom:10px">INTRO: Photographer Martin Klimas creates "sonic sculptures" by photographing paint vibrating to music</p>
      <div class="passage">In his studio in Düsseldorf, Germany, photographer Martin Klimas carefully pours paint onto a rubber membrane placed on top of an audio speaker. The paint collects in a puddle of colors: rich oranges and powder blues, hot pinks and electric yellows. Klimas attaches his camera to a tripod and positions the camera so it is level with the paint puddle. He then sets a sound trigger (a device that automatically snaps a photo when a given sound level is reached) on his camera. Finally, he inserts Daft Punk's Homework CD into a stereo, cranks up the volume to ten, and pushes Play.<br><br>The result is what Klimas calls a "sonic sculpture." The vibrations produced by Daft Punk's dance anthem "Around the World" cause the paint to rise, and this image that Klimas's camera captures—sound visually rendered by the effects of the vibrations on the paint. Although Klimas's photographs only capture an instant of the paint erupting in arcs of color, each of the photographs is unique to a given song.<br><br>"I leave the creation of the picture to the sound itself," Klimas says. Klimas's idea for his sonic sculptures was sparked by the experiments of Swiss scientist Hans Jenny. In the 1960s, Jenny studied the effects of sound vibrations on various materials. For example, Jenny discovered that low sonic tones caused powdery substances to form into uniform lines, while deeper tones caused the same powder to form into more nuanced patterns. Klimas relies on similar principles, only with a more compelling component: music.<br><br>Klimas has photographed sonic sculptures of classical music by Wagner and Bach; jazz by Miles Davis, Charlie Parker, and John Coltrane; and psychedelic rock by Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix. While he acknowledges that all forms of music can generate sonic sculptures, Klimas says, "I typically select something dynamic and percussive." That makes sense. After all, to create his art, Klimas needs his paint to get up and dance.</div>

      <h2>Test 1, Passage 4: Building and Rebuilding "the King of Roads"</h2>
      <p style="color:#ff0;margin-bottom:10px">INTRO: The history of the Columbia River Highway in Oregon</p>
      <div class="passage">Separating Oregon from Washington, the Columbia River Gorge is eighty-five miles of flowing water, tree-covered bluffs flank the river, and roaring waterfalls. These striking features daunted would-be road builders until 1913. That year, Samuel Hill and Samuel Lancaster, a businessman and an engineer, respectively, began constructing a road through the gorge to connect the towns along the river. Their design went beyond practicalities: it showcased the scenic grandeur of the gorge.<br><br>Columbia River Highway was a marvel. Roadside overlooks offered travelers the chance to take in a view of the river or a waterfall. Guardrails made of local rock lined the route and blurred the distinction between road and environment. Engineers created openings in the side of one tunnel, enabling motorists surrounded by rock to glimpse the river below. Completed in 1922, the highway earned the local nickname "the King of Roads."<br><br>Impressive as it was, the highway was soon outmoded because of increased traffic and larger vehicles. In time, Oregon built a new road along the Columbia, and much of the highway was destroyed to make room; other stretches were abandoned. By 1954, only the western third of the original road was still in use, mainly by tourists seeking waterfalls. The rest of the highway fell into disrepair.<br><br>In the 1980s, however, local people's interest in the original highway rekindled. In 1981, the National Park Service offered suggestions for restoring parts of the road and repurposing unused sections of it as a trail. Since then, crumbling stone guardrails along the roadside have been repaired. Damaged bridges and viaducts have been rebuilt. Tunnels, once filled with rubble, have been emptied and strengthened. Today, hikers and bikers on the Historic Columbia River Highway Trail experience the splendor of the highway that Hill and Lancaster envisioned over one hundred years ago.</div>

      <h2>Test 1, Passage 5: Selling Hip-Hop</h2>
      <p style="color:#ff0;margin-bottom:10px">INTRO: Sylvia Robinson and the commercialization of hip-hop music</p>
      <div class="passage">One night in the late seventies, at a popular club in New York City, singer and music producer Sylvia Robinson had a revelation. At the time, hip-hop subculture—based on the graffiti, breakdancing, deejaying, and rapping art forms—was emerging as a phenomenon. Robinson watched as DJ Lovebug Starski spun records for the crowd and rapped over the instrumental breaks in the music. Every time the DJ chanted, "Throw your hands in the air," everyone obeyed. Robinson could hear the enthusiasm shared between the hip-hop performer and his audience. She knew she had to capture that excitement on record.<br><br>Robinson wasted no time in recruiting three aspiring rappers: Big Bank Hank, Master Gee, and Wonder Mike—to record on her label as the Sugarhill Gang. Wanting to re-create the feel-good vibe of the music she'd heard, an upbeat disco record provided the background that the rappers rhymed over. The resulting track, "Rapper's Delight," sold fourteen million copies; Robinson had successfully brought hip-hop music to the mainstream.<br><br>Not everyone in the hip-hop community was happy with Robinson's commercial success. Some felt that hip-hop should remain underground, accessible only to its core followers. Others thought Robinson's approach was too pop-oriented and watered down hip-hop's raw, street-level energy. Critics also pointed out that "Rapper's Delight" borrowed heavily from the bass line of Chic's disco hit "Good Times" without initially crediting the original artists.<br><br>Despite the controversy, Robinson's impact on hip-hop cannot be denied. She proved that the genre could be commercially viable, paving the way for countless artists who followed. Her Sugarhill Records label went on to release other influential tracks, including Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's "The Message," which brought social commentary to hip-hop. Robinson's willingness to take a chance on an emerging art form helped transform hip-hop from a local phenomenon into a global cultural force.</div>

        Title: The Art of Film Dubbing
         | Author: Chiara Barzini
         | Source: Harper's Magazine article "Read My Lips"
      </div>
      <p style="color:#0ff;margin-bottom:10px">INTRO: Adapted from the article "Read My Lips" by Chiara Barzini, published in Harper's Magazine.</p>
      <div class="passage">Filmmakers have debated the respective merits of subtitles and dubbing since the earliest sound films. In "The Impossible Life of Clark Costa," published in 1940 in the film journal Cinema, director Michelangelo Antonioni wrote that Romolo Costa, the person who dubbed all of actor Clark Gable's performances, was a "hybrid individual born out of a chemical combination." This "half Clark, half Costa" was unbearable to Antonioni, who considered dubbing to be a mere "acoustic surrogate" of acting. To him, dubbing compromised the intention of the director, leading to an artificial product that lacked artistic unity.<br><br>Director Pier Paolo Pasolini, who called both dubbing and subtitles "evils," said that, between the two, dubbing was the less harmful, since it allowed you to see the picture in full. Director Jean Renoir called dubbing a "monstrosity, a challenge to human and divine laws."<br><br>Director Federico Fellini didn't agree with any of them. Dubbing was an extension of his shoots, a technique he would use to retouch and rewrite. He mercilessly dubbed over his actors, changing dialogue in postproduction, sometimes having worked without a script. (He reportedly instructed his actors to count aloud in front of the camera so that he could insert new dialogue afterward.) Renato Cortesi, a veteran Fellini dubber, told me that, during the filming of Amarcord (1973), he witnessed Fellini ask an old Neapolitan lady to tell him a sad story. Over footage of this woman recounting a tragic tale about her grandson, Fellini added a new sound track about war and hunger recorded by an actor from Emilia-Romagna, combining the vivid expressiveness of the South with his favorite northern accent.<br><br>If you visit a dubbing studio, the over-the-top zest of the actors is evident in everything from their melodramatic speech to their movements; standing in front of the microphone, they coil and twitch. I asked Cortesi whether this was a consequence of having to focus one's lifelong talent into the few centimeters between mouth and microphone, a kind of bodily rebellion to the condition of being heard but not seen, and he laughed. "Of course it isn't easy to spend a life in the darkness, but this is hardly the reason why they twitch and turn! Dubbers are used to reciting while trying to re-create the bodily sensations of what they see on the screen before them. If there is running in the film, they will run on their feet. The moving," he explained, "is the result of re-creating large movements in small spaces."<br><br>There are still few options for those seeking to watch subtitled, original-language films at a movie house in Italy. The Metropolitan cinema on Via del Corso closed recently after a long battle involving intellectuals, show-business people, and American tourists in Rome, to be replaced with a clothing store. Italians remain hooked on dubbing—perhaps because of simple affection. Familiar voices yield emotional attachment.<br><br>Francesco Vairano, a dubber and dubbing director known for adapting foreign films considered to be "undubbable," such as the French box office hit Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis ("Welcome to the Sticks," 2008), which relies on linguistic misunderstandings for much of its comedy, explained that actors become just as attached to their parts as audiences do. Vairano has been one of the few directors to break the habit of matching the same Italian dubber to a foreign actor for all his films, preferring instead to select the dubber according to the requirements of the role, and, he admits, he was hated by all the prima donna dubbers for this. "If you take that actor away from them," he told me, "they will insult you."<br><br>In 2007, I met dubber Luca Ward, who provided the voice of the narrator for a romantic comedy I co-wrote, Scusa ma Ti Chiamo Amore ("Sorry but I Love You"). What I didn't then know was that everyone Ward met wanted him to recite actor Samuel L. Jackson's Ezekiel 25:17 passage from the film Pulp Fiction, and that I should consider it an honor that he would offer a performance to a stranger. When he finally did recite the monologue, it was astonishing, every dramatic pause carefully timed and every word perfectly enunciated. I understood that, if anybody took Samuel L. Jackson away from Ward, it would have meant taking away a part of his soul; he was, as Antonioni would say, half Ward, half Jackson. Leaving the day's recording session, Ward told me he was off to have dinner with actress Meg Ryan, before raising an eyebrow and clarifying, "With Meg Ryan's dubber... I am having dinner with Meg Ryan's voice."</div>

      <div class="passage">Passage A<br><br>If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon and stars, we would go in darkness happily, the midnight world as visible to us as it is to the vast number of nocturnal species on this planet. Instead, we are diurnal creatures, with eyes adapted to living in the sun's light. This is a basic evolutionary fact, even though most of us don't think of ourselves as diurnal beings any more than we think of ourselves as primates or mammals or Earthlings. Yet it's the only way to explain what we've done to the night: We've engineered it to receive us by filling it with light.<br><br>This kind of engineering is no different from damming a river. Its benefits come with consequences—called light pollution—whose effects scientists are only now beginning to study. Light pollution is largely the result of bad lighting design, which allows artificial light to shine outward and upward into the sky, where it's not wanted, instead of focusing it downward, where it is. Wherever human light spills into the natural world, some aspect of life—migration, reproduction, feeding—is affected, and not for the better.<br><br>Most cities have never been darker, in the sense of having less exposure to natural darkness, and so today's children in urban areas are growing up largely blind to the stars and planets. We've become so used to the glow of light pollution that we may not even miss the darkness when it's gone. But the ecological and human health consequences of disrupting natural patterns of light and dark are real.<br><br>Passage B<br><br>I worry we are rapidly losing night's natural darkness before realizing its worth. For those of us living in cities and suburbs, it has been lost already. We have forgotten what real darkness is like. We have forgotten what we are missing.<br><br>But it's not too late. The  decision to keep our night skies dark is not some abstract scientific or environmental issue—this is about our human heritage, our quality of life, and our cultural connection to the universe. To see the Milky Way draped across the sky is to realize our place in the cosmos—it's our home galaxy, visible from the surface of our home planet.<br><br>Astronomers divide darkness into categories. "Truly dark sky" means you can see the Milky Way in detail. But near cities, sky glow brightens the night, and the Milky Way becomes difficult or impossible to see. Studies show that two-thirds of Americans and Europeans no longer experience truly dark skies. More than 99 percent of people living in the United States and Europe experience light-polluted skies.<br><br>What we lose when we lose darkness is hard to measure but easy to experience. Stand under a dark sky and look up. Give your eyes time to adjust—the cones and rods need time to become sensitive. After twenty minutes or so, the stars begin to emerge, more and more of them, until the sky is full. This is our natural birthright: a sky filled with stars and the arc of the Milky Way, our home in the universe made visible.</div>

        Title: Glaciers
        
         | Source: Article about glaciers
      </div>
      <p style="color:#0ff;margin-bottom:10px">INTRO: This passage is adapted from an article about glaciers and their role in Earth's climate system.</p>
      <div class="passage">Glaciers are massive bodies of ice that form over many years from compressed snow. They exist on every continent except Australia, though the vast majority of the world's ice is contained in the ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland. Despite their solid appearance, glaciers are constantly in motion, flowing slowly downhill under their own weight like rivers of ice.<br><br>The formation of a glacier begins when snow accumulates faster than it melts. Over time, the weight of new snow compresses the layers beneath it, squeezing out the air and transforming the snow into dense ice. This process can take decades or even centuries, depending on the climate and location. Once the ice becomes thick enough—typically about 100 feet—gravity causes it to begin flowing downhill.<br><br>Glaciers play a crucial role in Earth's climate system and have a significant impact on global sea levels. They act as frozen reservoirs, storing approximately 69 percent of the world's fresh water. When glaciers grow, they lock up water that would otherwise be in the ocean, causing sea levels to drop. When they melt, they release this water back into the sea, causing sea levels to rise.<br><br>Scientists study glaciers to understand past climate conditions and to predict future changes. Ice cores drilled from glaciers contain layers of ice that correspond to different time periods, much like tree rings. By analyzing these layers, scientists can determine past temperatures, atmospheric composition, and even the presence of volcanic eruptions. Some ice cores contain records going back hundreds of thousands of years.<br><br>In recent decades, glaciers around the world have been retreating at an accelerating rate. Measurements show that glaciers in Alaska, Greenland, Asia, and the Alps are losing mass faster than they are gaining it. This retreat is primarily attributed to rising global temperatures caused by human activities. As glaciers melt, they contribute to sea level rise, which threatens coastal communities around the world.<br><br>The loss of glaciers also affects freshwater availability. In many regions, particularly in South America and Asia, glaciers feed rivers that provide water for millions of people. As these glaciers shrink, the rivers they feed may experience reduced flow, especially during dry seasons when glacier meltwater is most needed. This could lead to water shortages and conflicts over water resources.<br><br>Beyond their practical importance, glaciers hold an aesthetic and cultural significance. They have inspired artists, writers, and explorers for centuries. The sight of a massive glacier calving—breaking off large chunks of ice into the sea—is both beautiful and sobering, a reminder of the power of natural forces and the changes happening to our planet.</div>

        Title: Ocean Acidification
        
        
      </div>
      
      <div class="passage">Ocean acidification, often called "the other CO₂ problem," occurs when carbon dioxide from the atmosphere dissolves in seawater, forming carbonic acid. As atmospheric CO₂ levels have increased due to human activities since the Industrial Revolution, the ocean has absorbed about 30% of this excess carbon dioxide. While this absorption has helped slow the rate of climate change by reducing the amount of CO₂ in the atmosphere, it has come at a cost to marine ecosystems.<br><br>When CO₂ dissolves in seawater, it forms carbonic acid, which releases hydrogen ions and lowers the pH of the water. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the ocean's pH has dropped by approximately 0.1 units, from 8.2 to 8.1. While this may seem like a small change, the pH scale is logarithmic, meaning that this represents a 26% increase in acidity. Scientists predict that if current trends continue, ocean pH could drop by another 0.3-0.4 units by the end of this century.<br><br>The effects of ocean acidification are already being observed in marine ecosystems around the world. Many marine organisms, including corals, mollusks, and some plankton species, rely on calcium carbonate to build their shells and skeletons. As ocean pH decreases, it becomes more difficult for these organisms to extract the carbonate ions they need from seawater. This process, called calcification, becomes increasingly energy-intensive as acidity increases, forcing organisms to divert energy from other vital functions such as growth, reproduction, and immune response.<br><br>Coral reefs are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification. These diverse ecosystems support approximately 25% of all marine species despite covering less than 1% of the ocean floor. As acidification progresses, corals struggle to maintain their calcium carbonate skeletons, and existing structures may even begin to dissolve. This weakens the reef structure and reduces its ability to provide habitat for the countless species that depend on coral reefs for shelter and food.<br><br>The impacts extend beyond individual organisms to entire food webs. Many species at the base of marine food chains, such as pteropods (tiny swimming snails), are showing signs of shell dissolution in increasingly acidic waters. These organisms serve as food for fish, seabirds, and marine mammals, so their decline could have cascading effects throughout ocean ecosystems.<br><br>Researchers are working to understand how different species might adapt to changing ocean chemistry. Some organisms may develop greater tolerance to acidic conditions through natural selection, while others may be forced to migrate to areas with more favorable water chemistry. However, the rapid pace of change may outstrip the ability of many species to adapt, particularly those with slow reproduction rates or limited mobility.<br><br>Addressing ocean acidification requires reducing global CO₂ emissions, as the ocean will continue to absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide as long as concentrations remain elevated. In the meantime, scientists and conservationists are exploring strategies to help marine ecosystems cope with changing conditions, including establishing marine protected areas in regions that may be more resilient to acidification and reducing other stressors such as pollution and overfishing that could compound the effects of changing ocean chemistry.</div>
