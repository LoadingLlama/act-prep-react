FIGURE FORMAT ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================

KEY FINDING: Most figures are DESCRIBED IN TEXT, not stored as structured data
Pattern: Stems say "In the figure below..." but figure_data is often empty
Implication: Figures are likely rendered separately (images/diagrams) and referenced in text
