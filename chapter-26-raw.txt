Chapter 26: Word Problems
One of the challenges of the ACT Math Test is dealing with everyone’s least favorite questions: word
problems. Word problems are often written in a way that makes it confusing to figure out exactly what is
happening in the question. Word problems include a wide variety of math topics that we have already learned

in this book, so we will not cover any specific type of word problem in this chapter. Instead, we will focus on
the tips that can help you solve all types of word problems more effectively and efficiently.

Tip #1 — Do Not Be Intimidated
Word problems look scary. Many students see a big paragraph and say, “no way, I can’t solve that.” They feel
intimidated before even trying to solve the question. Do not let this be you! Word problems at their core are
no more difficult than any other ACT Math questions. When you see a big paragraph on test day, take a deep

breath and solve it one step at a time.

Tip #2 — Turn Words into Equations
When approaching a word problem, take it one sentence at a time. As you read through the question, identify
each piece of key information and write it down in an equation. If you can convert the question from a word
problem into an equation or equation(s), the question will be much easier to solve.
One of the most common types of word problems is a system of equations question, which we covered in
Chapter 15 on pp. 129-130. For these questions, you will need to turn the word problem into two equations.

Once you have converted the word problem into two equations, you will be able to solve the question with the
methods we learned in Chapter 15.

Tip #3 — Backsolve with the Answer Choices
For some word problems, writing your own equation(s) is very difficult and may not be the fastest or easiest
way to solve. If you cannot write out the equation(s) or are not sure if the equation(s) that you wrote are
correct, try backsolving. Sometimes it is faster and easier to take the answer choices, go through the steps of
the word problem, and see if you have the correct answer. Even if you cannot tell which answer is correct,
backsolving can often help you eliminate some answer choices and make a better guess. If you need to review
how to backsolve, go back to Chapter 1.

Tip #4 — Guess and Move on (If You Have To)
If you get to a word problem, try using the tips above, and still have no idea how to solve it, circle the
question, bubble in your best guess, and move on! It is easy to waste a lot of time reading and rereading long,
confusing word problems. Students who do this often end up running out of time. Save those precious
minutes to answer more questions that you know how to solve. We know it sounds backwards but giving up
quickly on a word problem that you have no idea how to solve may help you actually get a better score.
If you complete the rest of the questions in the section and have time remaining, you can always come back to
any questions that you guessed on. Sometimes, when re-reading the question, you will realize how to solve it.
It is easier to think more clearly when you are no longer worried about finishing the rest of the questions on the
test.
