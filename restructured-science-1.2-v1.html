The most important skill for success on the ACT Science Test is knowing exactly where to look for information in each passage—a skill we call "question diagnosis." When you read a question and its answer choices, both provide crucial clues that direct you to the specific part of the passage containing your answer, whether that's a particular figure, experimental description, introductory text, or your own scientific reasoning.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Mastering question diagnosis allows you to work faster and more accurately by eliminating the guesswork about where to search, preventing you from wasting time re-reading unnecessary sections, and ensuring you consistently find the information you need to answer correctly. As you develop this diagnostic skill, you'll notice patterns in how questions are structured and become increasingly efficient at locating answers.

1. The Four Places to Look in a Science Passage
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Every Science passage contains four distinct information sources, and different question types require you to look in different places. Understanding these four sources and developing diagnostic skills to identify which source contains your answer is the foundation of efficient Science Test performance.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Source 1: Figures and Tables (Most Common)
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Figures and tables are the most frequently referenced source for Science questions—approximately 60-70% of all questions can be answered by examining graphs, charts, tables, and diagrams. The ACT typically makes it easy to identify when to use figures by explicitly directing you in the question stem (for example: "According to Figure 2..." or "Based on Table 1...").
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Most figure and table questions can be answered without reading any passage text at all—if you can read axis labels, identify trends, and locate data points, you can answer correctly. This is why the figure-first reading approach is so effective: you're prioritizing the passage element that contains the most testable information.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">When to look at Figures and Tables:</strong>
</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The question explicitly directs you to a specific figure or table ("Figure 1," "Table 2," "the graph," "the diagram," etc.)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is the clearest diagnostic signal—always trust direct references</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Go immediately to that figure or table and analyze it to find your answer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The answer choices consist entirely of numbers with units (e.g., "25 m/s," "1.5 kg," "300°C")
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Numerical answers with units almost always come from data shown in figures or tables</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Scan the figures to find which one contains the units mentioned in the answer choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use the question stem to identify what conditions or values to look for</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The question asks about trends, relationships, or comparisons between variables
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Questions like "As X increases, Y..." or "Which variable had the greatest effect on..." require visual data</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Identify which figure shows both variables mentioned in the question</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 1rem 0; padding: 1rem; background-color: #f9fafb; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb;">
<strong>Example Question:</strong> According to Figure 2, at a temperature of 40°C, what was the approximate reaction rate?<br><br>
A. 1.2 mol/sec<br>
B. 2.5 mol/sec<br>
C. 3.8 mol/sec<br>
D. 5.1 mol/sec
</p>

<p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 1rem 0;">
<strong>Diagnosis:</strong> This question explicitly references "Figure 2" and the answer choices are all numbers with units (mol/sec). <strong>Where to look:</strong> Go directly to Figure 2, locate 40°C on the x-axis, trace up to the data line, then across to the y-axis to read the reaction rate value.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Source 2: Experimental Text (Procedures and Descriptions)
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Experimental text refers to the paragraphs that describe how experiments were conducted, what materials were used, what conditions were tested, and what variables were controlled or manipulated. This text typically appears directly above or near the figures and tables it relates to, often in sections labeled "Experiment 1," "Trial 2," "Study 3," etc.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Questions requiring experimental text usually ask about aspects of the experiment that aren't visible in the figures themselves—such as what was held constant, what differed between trials, what materials were used, or how measurements were taken. The experimental text provides essential context that explains what the data in the figures represents and how it was collected.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">When to look at Experimental Text:</strong>
</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The question asks about experimental setup, procedures, or methods
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Key phrases: "In the experiment," "The procedure involved," "In Trial 2," "How was X measured?"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These questions test your understanding of experimental design, not just data interpretation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The question asks about differences between multiple experiments, trials, or studies
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Key phrases: "How did Experiment 1 differ from Experiment 2?" or "What was the same in all three trials?"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The experimental text explicitly states what changed and what remained constant</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The question asks about variables or conditions not shown in the figures or tables
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sometimes controlled variables (held constant) aren't displayed in figures but are described in text</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "What volume of solution was used?" might be mentioned in text but not graphed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The answer choices contain units or values that don't appear in any figures
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If answer choices mention measurements, materials, or conditions not visible in graphs/tables, check experimental descriptions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 1rem 0; padding: 1rem; background-color: #f9fafb; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb;">
<strong>Example Question:</strong> In Experiment 2, which of the following was held constant?<br><br>
A. Temperature<br>
B. pH level<br>
C. Concentration<br>
D. Volume of solution
</p>

<p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 1rem 0;">
<strong>Diagnosis:</strong> This question asks what was "held constant" in a specific experiment, which is information about experimental design. <strong>Where to look:</strong> Read the Experiment 2 description to identify which variable was controlled (not changed). The text might say something like "Temperature was maintained at 25°C while concentration was varied from 0.1 M to 0.5 M," indicating that temperature and pH were held constant.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Source 3: Introductory Text (Definitions and Background)
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Introductory text appears at the beginning of each passage and provides background information, context, and definitions of key terms. This section typically explains the scientific phenomenon being studied, introduces important vocabulary, and sometimes provides theoretical background or real-world context for the experiments or data that follow.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Most questions don't require you to use the introductory text, which is why the recommended reading strategy involves only briefly skimming this section. However, when you encounter unfamiliar terms, acronyms, or concepts in a question, the introductory text is where you'll find their definitions. The ACT makes this easy by putting important defined terms in <em>italics</em>, allowing you to quickly scan for the term you need.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">When to look at Introductory Text:</strong>
</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The question contains terms, abbreviations, or scientific words you don't recognize
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Terms are usually defined in the intro and appear in <em>italics</em></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: If a question mentions "RM" and you don't know what it means, scan the intro for "RM" in italics—you might find "Reactive Material (RM) refers to..."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">You need general background or context about what's being studied
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sometimes understanding the broader scientific context helps clarify what variables represent</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is more common with Conflicting Viewpoints passages where theoretical understanding matters</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">You've already checked experimental text and figures but still can't find the information you need
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The introductory text is your "backup" source when other sections don't contain the answer</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sometimes conceptual or definitional information only appears in the introduction</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 1rem 0; padding: 1rem; background-color: #f9fafb; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb;">
<strong>Example Question:</strong> Based on the passage, which of the following best describes sublimation?<br><br>
A. The transition from solid directly to gas<br>
B. The transition from liquid to gas<br>
C. The transition from gas to solid<br>
D. The transition from solid to liquid
</p>

<p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 1rem 0;">
<strong>Diagnosis:</strong> This question asks for a definition of a scientific term ("sublimation"). <strong>Where to look:</strong> Scan the introductory text for <em>sublimation</em> in italics. You'll likely find a sentence like "Sublimation, the process by which a substance transitions directly from solid to gas without passing through the liquid phase, was observed under certain pressure conditions." Answer: A.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Source 4: Not in the Passage (Outside Knowledge and Scientific Reasoning)
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Some questions on the Science Test cannot be answered by referencing any part of the passage—instead, they require you to apply basic scientific knowledge from biology, chemistry, or physics, or to use general scientific reasoning and experimental thinking. These questions are relatively uncommon (appearing 2-4 times per test) but are important to recognize so you don't waste time searching the passage for information that isn't there.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Scientific Knowledge Questions</strong> require you to recall fundamental science concepts. For example, you might need to know that water freezes at 0°C, that photosynthesis requires sunlight, that atoms are made of protons/neutrons/electrons, or that denser objects sink in less dense fluids. The ACT only tests general knowledge that students who have completed high school biology, chemistry, and physics would be familiar with—nothing obscure or advanced.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Experimental Thinking Questions</strong> require you to apply scientific reasoning about how experiments should be designed, what makes a good control, how to test a hypothesis, or what factors might affect results. These questions ask you to "think like a scientist" rather than find specific information. For example: "To test the effect of temperature on plant growth, which of the following should be held constant?" requires reasoning about experimental design, not passage-specific information.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">When to use Outside Knowledge/Reasoning:</strong>
</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The question asks about general scientific principles, facts, or concepts
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Key phrases: "According to scientific principles," "In general," "Which of the following is true about..."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These questions don't reference specific parts of the passage</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The question asks how to improve an experiment or what should be controlled
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Experimental design questions require scientific reasoning, not passage information</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Think about what makes experiments valid and reliable</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The answer choices don't match any information in the passage
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you've checked figures, experimental text, and introductory text and haven't found the answer, it's likely an outside knowledge question</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don't waste time searching—use your scientific reasoning instead</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 1rem 0; padding: 1rem; background-color: #f9fafb; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb;">
<strong>Example Question:</strong> Which of the following is a characteristic of all living organisms?<br><br>
A. They perform photosynthesis<br>
B. They maintain homeostasis<br>
C. They have a nervous system<br>
D. They reproduce sexually
</p>

<p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 1rem 0;">
<strong>Diagnosis:</strong> This question asks about a general biological principle, not specific passage information. <strong>Where to look:</strong> Don't look in the passage—use your biology knowledge. All living organisms maintain homeostasis (internal balance), but not all perform photosynthesis (only plants/some bacteria), have nervous systems (only animals), or reproduce sexually (some reproduce asexually). Answer: B.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Diagnostic Signals in Question Stems
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Question stems (the question itself, before the answer choices) contain powerful diagnostic signals that tell you where to look for information. Learning to recognize these signals instantly will dramatically improve your efficiency because you'll know exactly where to go without hesitation or random searching.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Explicit References (Strongest Signal)
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
The clearest diagnostic signals are explicit references to specific passage elements. When you see these, trust them completely—the ACT is directly telling you where to find the answer:
</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>"According to Figure 2..."</strong> → Go directly to Figure 2</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>"Based on Table 1..."</strong> → Go directly to Table 1</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>"In Experiment 3..."</strong> → Go to the Experiment 3 description and related figures</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>"The diagram shows..."</strong> → Go to the diagram</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>"In the passage..."</strong> → The information is somewhere in the text (intro or experimental descriptions)</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Never waste time searching elsewhere when you see explicit references. Even if you think you remember the answer, always verify by checking the referenced source—this prevents careless errors from misremembering or confusing similar data.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Variable-Based Questions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
When questions mention specific variables or measurements, use those as search terms to locate the right figure or text section:
</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>"As temperature increased..."</strong> → Find the figure with temperature on one axis</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>"When pH was 7..."</strong> → Find the figure or table showing pH values</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>"The relationship between pressure and volume..."</strong> → Find the figure showing both pressure and volume</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Scanning axis labels and table headers for these variable names is much faster than reading entire paragraphs of text.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Procedure and Setup Questions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Certain phrases indicate you need to read experimental descriptions rather than examine figures:
</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>"How did the scientists measure..."</strong> → Experimental text describes methods</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>"Which variable was held constant..."</strong> → Experimental text states controlled variables</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>"What was the difference between Trial 1 and Trial 2..."</strong> → Experimental text explains what changed</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>"The procedure involved..."</strong> → Experimental text describes steps</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Definition Questions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Questions asking "what is" or "which of the following describes" a term usually require the introductory text:
</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>"What is meant by..."</strong> → Scan intro for italicized term</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>"Which best describes [term]..."</strong> → Look for definition in intro</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>"The passage states that [term]..."</strong> → Find where term is introduced/defined</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
General Knowledge Indicators
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
These phrases signal that you should use scientific reasoning or outside knowledge rather than passage information:
</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>"In general..."</strong> → Applies to scientific principles, not passage-specific data</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>"Which of the following is true about [general concept]..."</strong> → Outside knowledge</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>"To improve this experiment, scientists should..."</strong> → Experimental reasoning</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>"Which would be the best control..."</strong> → Scientific method reasoning</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Diagnostic Signals in Answer Choices
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Answer choices provide equally important diagnostic information, and skilled test-takers always read them before searching for information. The format, content, and units in answer choices tell you what type of information you're looking for and help you narrow down where to find it.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Numerical Answers with Units
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
When all answer choices are numbers with units, you know you're looking for specific data values in a figure or table:
</p>

<table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1.5rem 0; font-size: 15px;">
  <thead>
    <tr style="background-color: #f3f4f6; border-bottom: 2px solid #d1d5db;">
      <th style="padding: 0.75rem; text-align: left; font-weight: 600; color: #374151;">Answer Choice Format</th>
      <th style="padding: 0.75rem; text-align: left; font-weight: 600; color: #374151;">What It Tells You</th>
      <th style="padding: 0.75rem; text-align: left; font-weight: 600; color: #374151;">Where to Look</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">
      <td style="padding: 0.75rem; color: #1f2937;">A. 25°C<br>B. 30°C<br>C. 35°C<br>D. 40°C</td>
      <td style="padding: 0.75rem; color: #1f2937;">You need to find a specific temperature value</td>
      <td style="padding: 0.75rem; color: #1f2937;">Find the figure/table with temperature (°C) on an axis or in a column</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">
      <td style="padding: 0.75rem; color: #1f2937;">A. 1.2 g/mL<br>B. 1.5 g/mL<br>C. 1.8 g/mL<br>D. 2.1 g/mL</td>
      <td style="padding: 0.75rem; color: #1f2937;">You need to find a density value</td>
      <td style="padding: 0.75rem; color: #1f2937;">Find the figure/table showing density (g/mL)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">

Categorical or Descriptive Answers
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
When answer choices are words or phrases rather than numbers, you're usually looking for conceptual understanding or trends rather than specific data values:
</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Trend descriptions</strong> (A. Increased, B. Decreased, C. Remained constant, D. Fluctuated) → Look at figure to identify visual pattern</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Comparison terms</strong> (A. Greater than, B. Less than, C. Equal to, D. Cannot be determined) → Compare values in figures or tables</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Experimental conditions</strong> (A. Temperature, B. pH, C. Concentration, D. Volume) → Check experimental text for what was changed/controlled</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Scientific concepts</strong> (A. Photosynthesis, B. Respiration, C. Transpiration, D. Germination) → May require outside knowledge or definitions from intro</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Yes/No or True/False Format
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Sometimes answer choices follow a pattern where two say "Yes" or "True" and two say "No" or "False," each with different reasoning:
</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">A. Yes, because [reason 1]</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">B. Yes, because [reason 2]</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">C. No, because [reason 3]</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">D. No, because [reason 4]</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
For these questions, first determine whether the answer is yes/no (or true/false) based on passage evidence, then evaluate which reasoning is correct. This two-step approach often allows you to eliminate two choices immediately.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Using Answer Choices to Eliminate Impossible Options
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Answer choices can help you eliminate clearly wrong options without even finding the exact answer. For example:
</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">If the figure shows values ranging from 10-50, eliminate any answer choice with values like 5 or 75</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">If the graph clearly shows an increasing trend, eliminate answer choices saying "decreased" or "remained constant"</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">If the passage only mentions Trials 1-3, eliminate answer choices referencing "Trial 4"</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">If units in an answer choice don't match any units shown in figures, that choice is likely incorrect</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Strategic elimination based on answer choice analysis can save significant time and increase accuracy, especially when you're unsure of the exact answer.

4. The Question Diagnosis Workflow
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Effective question diagnosis follows a systematic workflow that becomes automatic with practice. Following this sequence ensures you're working efficiently and looking in the right places:
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 1: Read the Question Stem Completely
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Don't start searching for information until you've read the entire question. Identify:
</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Any explicit references to figures, tables, or experiments</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Key variables or measurements mentioned</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">What the question is asking for (a value? a trend? a procedure? a definition?)</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 2: Read All Answer Choices
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Before searching the passage, read all four answer choices to determine:
</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">What format the answer takes (numbers with units? descriptions? yes/no?)</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">What units or variables appear in the choices</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Whether any choices can be immediately eliminated as impossible</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 3: Diagnose the Source
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Based on the question stem and answer choices, determine which of the four sources to check:
</p>

<table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1.5rem 0; font-size: 15px;">
  <thead>
    <tr style="background-color: #f3f4f6; border-bottom: 2px solid #d1d5db;">
      <th style="padding: 0.75rem; text-align: left; font-weight: 600; color: #374151;">If the Question...</th>
      <th style="padding: 0.75rem; text-align: left; font-weight: 600; color: #374151;">Check This Source First</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">
      <td style="padding: 0.75rem; color: #1f2937;">Explicitly references a figure/table</td>
      <td style="padding: 0.75rem; color: #1f2937;"><strong>Figures and Tables</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">
      <td style="padding: 0.75rem; color: #1f2937;">Has numerical answers with units</td>
      <td style="padding: 0.75rem; color: #1f2937;"><strong>Figures and Tables</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">
      <td style="padding: 0.75rem; color: #1f2937;">Asks about experimental setup or differences</td>
      <td style="padding: 0.75rem; color: #1f2937;"><strong>Experimental Text</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">
      <td style="padding: 0.75rem; color: #1f2937;">Asks for a definition or meaning of a term</td>
      <td style="padding: 0.75rem; color: #1f2937;"><strong>Introductory Text</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">
      <td style="padding: 0.75rem; color: #1f2937;">Asks about general scientific principles</td>
      <td style="padding: 0.75rem; color: #1f2937;"><strong>Outside Knowledge</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">
      <td style="padding: 0.75rem; color: #1f2937;">Asks about experimental design or improvement</td>
      <td style="padding: 0.75rem; color: #1f2937;"><strong>Scientific Reasoning</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 4: Find and Verify the Answer
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Go to the diagnosed source and locate the specific information needed. Always verify your answer against the passage rather than relying on memory. If you don't find the answer in your first diagnosed location:
</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Check if you're looking at the correct figure or section</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Try the next most likely source (if you checked figures, try experimental text)</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Re-read the question to ensure you understood what it's asking</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">If still stuck after 45-60 seconds, make your best guess and move on</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 5: Eliminate and Select
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Use the information you found to eliminate incorrect answer choices and select the correct one. Double-check that:
</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Your answer matches the question being asked (don't answer "what is the temperature?" when the question asks "what is the pressure?")</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Units match if applicable</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">You're reading the correct row/column/axis/data point</li>
</ul>

Key Takeaways
</h3>

<ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Every Science passage contains four information sources: Figures/Tables (most common, 60-70% of questions), Experimental Text (procedures and setup), Introductory Text (definitions and background), and Outside Knowledge/Scientific Reasoning (general principles and experimental thinking).
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Look at Figures and Tables when questions explicitly reference them, when answer choices contain numbers with units, or when questions ask about trends and relationships between variables—most questions can be answered from visual data alone without reading passage text.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Look at Experimental Text when questions ask about setup, procedures, what differed between trials, what was held constant, or when questions reference variables or conditions not shown in figures—this text explains the context behind the data.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Look at Introductory Text when you encounter unfamiliar terms (scan for italicized definitions) or when you've checked other sources but haven't found the answer—the intro provides background context and defines key vocabulary used throughout the passage.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Question stems provide diagnostic signals: explicit references ("According to Figure 2") tell you exactly where to look, variable names help you identify relevant figures, procedure language indicates experimental text, definition requests point to introductory text, and general knowledge phrasing signals outside knowledge questions.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Answer choices provide equally important clues: numerical answers with units indicate you're looking for data in figures/tables, the specific units shown tell you which figure contains the answer, categorical/descriptive answers suggest trend or concept questions, and impossible values can be eliminated immediately.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Follow the diagnostic workflow systematically: read the complete question stem, read all answer choices, diagnose which source to check based on signals, find and verify the answer in that source, then eliminate wrong choices and select the correct answer—this systematic approach prevents random searching and wasted time.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Always trust explicit references in question stems and verify your answers by checking the passage rather than relying on memory—even if you think you remember the data, taking 3-5 seconds to confirm prevents careless errors and is faster than second-guessing yourself.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>If you can't find the answer in your initially diagnosed source within 45-60 seconds, check the next most likely source, re-read the question to ensure understanding, or make your best guess and move on—don't waste valuable time stuck on one question.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Question diagnosis becomes automatic with practice—the more you consciously practice identifying signals and matching them to sources, the faster and more accurate you'll become, eventually diagnosing questions almost instantly without conscious effort.
