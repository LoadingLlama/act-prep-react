
On the ACT, a determinant question could be that simple! However, the ACT more commonly includes a
variable as show in Example 3.
Example 3: The determinant of matrix B is equal to 10. What is the value of x?
—4

‘|

B=[% x
A. —4

B. —-1

C. 0

D. 4

Solution: To solve for x, we need to set up the determinant equation and solve for x. We are told that the
determinant of matrix B is equal to 10, so the determinant equation is

—4(x) — 6(1) = 10
—4x —6= 10
—4x
= 16
x=-4
The answer is A.

Determinant questions appear occasionally on the ACT. However, the far more commonly tested “advanced”
matrix questions involve matrix multiplication, which we will learn next.

Matrix Multiplication
The most common type of “advanced” matrix question on the ACT is matrix multiplication. There are two
steps in matrix multiplication: (1) determining whether multiplication will be defined or undefined and (2)

completing the multiplication.

Defined vs. Undefined Results from Matrix Multiplication
The first step in matrix multiplication is determining if the result of matrix multiplication will be defined or

undefined and, if the result 1s defined, what the resulting matrix’s dimensions will be. To do this, we use the
dimensions of the matrices and the following steps.

1.

Write down the dimensions of the two matrices that you are multiplying together. For example,

if you are multiplying matrix A, a (1 X 2) matrix, and matrix B, a (2 x 3) matrix, we write:

AB = (1X 2) x (2x 3)
2.

Draw a box around the middle 2 numbers and see if those 2 numbers match. This tells you if the
matrix is defined or undefined. For our example, we would put a box like this:

AB = (1 x/2)
x (2|x 3)
a.

Ifthe numbers do not match, the matrix is undefined. You can stop here, as there is no
more math that needs to be done.

b.

Ifthe numbers match, the matrix is defined. For a matrix to be defined, the number of
columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix.

Continue to step 3 to find the dimensions of the resulting matrix. Our example above is
defined, so we will continue to step 3.
3.

Bring down the first and last numbers (the 2 numbers outside the box) to find the dimensions of

the resulting matrix. With our example, we bring down the 1 and 3 to see the resulting matrix will

be a (1 X 3) matrix, as shown below:

(1 x|2) x (2|x 3)

NX

¢

AB = (1x3)

4.

Now that we know that the matrix AB is a (1 X 3) matrix. The second step, which we will learn next
in this chapter, is to complete the matrix multiplication to find the values that will be in the matrix.

Example 4: Using the matrices shown below, which of the following is a (2 x 3) matrix?

a=[5|
A. AB

B. CB

B=|> 1
C. BC

C=[ 45 . |

D. CA

Solution: To find which matrix will be a (2 x 3) matrix, we need to first know the dimensions of the matrices

presented in the question. Matrix A is (2 x 1), matrix B is (2 x 2), and matrix C is (2 x 3). Now, we need to
set up the matrix multiplication for all the answer choices.
We can start with answer choice A, matrix AB.

AB = (2 x[1) x (2]x 2)
The middle numbers in the box do not match, so AB is undefined.

- 181
-

math

Next, let’s try answer choice B, matrix CB.

CB = (2 x[3) x (2|x 2)
The middle numbers in the box do not match, so CB is undefined.

Next, let’s try answer choice C, matrix BC.

wc
= ax

x axa)

NX

£

BC = (23)

BC is a (2 X 3) matrix, so C is correct. To finish explaining the answer choices, let’s go over answer choices D

as well.
For answer choice D, we get

CA =(2 x[3) x (2]x 1)
The middle numbers in the box do not match, so CA is undefined.

BA is defined and is a (2 X 1) matrix. The only answer choice that results in a (2 X 3) matrix is BC, so the
answer is C.

Questions like Example 4 appear occasionally on the ACT, so make sure you understand this before moving on to
the next topic.
You will more commonly use this skill as the first step in matrix multiplication, a topic that the ACT loves to test

in the more difficult questions that appear towards the end of the ACT Math test.

Matrix Multiplication — How To Find The Values In The Matrix
Multiplying matrices is a tricky task that can be broken down into two major steps: (1) finding out if the matrix is
defined or undefined (the skill we just learned on the last two pages) and (2) determining the resulting values in
the matrix. We have already learned step 1, so now we need to learn step 2.
To learn how this works, let’s work through the entire process using the matrices below to find matrix AB.

Determine if AB is defined or undefined.

The middle numbers match, so the matrix is defined.

AB = (2 X 2)
2.

B=|<, 9 |

AB isa (2 X 2) matrix.

Multiply AB and find the values in the new matrix.

To find the values in the matrix AB, we work horizontally ACROSS the first matrix, matrix A, and DOWN

the second matrix, matrix B. To find the values that go in matrix AB, we do a combination of multiplication and

addition.
To start, let’s solve for top left spot in matrix AB, which is labeled as w below. To solve for the top left, we use
the top row in matrix A and the left column in matrix B, as shown by the gray boxes below. When multiplying
matrices, always start at the left of the row and the top of the column. We multiply the 1st terms, 2 and 3,
together. We then go to the 2nd terms, —4 and —2, and multiply those together. Finally, we sum those two
products to get the value for the top left spot in matrix AB, as shown below.

To solve for the top right spot in matrix AB, which is labeled as x below, we repeat that process except now we
use the top row in matrix A and the right column in matrix B. We multiply the Ist terms, 2 and 1, together. We

then go to the 2nd terms, —4 and 9, and multiply those together. Finally, we sum those two products to get the
value for the top right spot in matrix AB, as shown below.

To solve for the bottom left spot in matrix AB, which is labeled as y below, we repeat that process except now we
use the bottom row in matrix A and the left column in matrix B. We multiply the 1st terms, —6 and 3, together.
We then go to the 2nd terms, 1 and —2, and multiply those together. Finally, we sum those two products to get
the value for the top right spot in matrix AB, as shown below.

Finally, to solve for the bottom right spot in matrix AB, which is labeled as z below, we repeat that process except

now we use the bottom row in matrix A and the right column in matrix B.

Bottom Right: ls =" x |, 5 | = hy 4

z = (-6)(1)
+ (1)(9) = 3

[6 1 | * [ 9] = “20 3 |
Now, we are done and have solved for matrix AB.
*Test-Taking Tip: When solving any matrix question, check the answer choices once you find the value for

any position in the matrix. You can often find the correct answer after solving for only 1 or 2 positions in the
matrix.

Next, let’s work through an example where the matrices had different dimensions. Note that the steps for matrix
multiplication are always the same no matter what the matrices involved look like, so we will follow the same
process we did for the previous example.
Example 5: Using the matrices below, XY

is equal to:
—5

6

3

-2

X=| 2 =|
A.[39 10 17]

4|

C. | —14
1

—39

D. | 10 |
17

Solution: To solve, we first need to find the dimensions of matrix XY.

XY = (8 X2)x (2x1)

The middle numbers match, so the matrix is defined.

XY
= (3X1)

XY isa
(3 X 1) matrix.

We know that XY is a (3 X 1) matrix, so we already know the correct answer is D or E. Even if you find
multiplying matrices difficult, if you can master this first step, you will likely be guessing between only 2 or 3

answer choices on test day.
Next, we need to multiply XY

to find the values in matrix. Remember, we work across our first matrix, X, and

down our second matrix, Y.
Let’s start with the top spot in matrix XY, which is labeled as a below. To solve for the top, we use the top row in
matrix X and the only column in matrix Y, as shown by the gray boxes below. When multiplying matrices, we

start at the left of the row and the top of the column. We multiply the Ist terms, —5 and 3, together. We then
go to the 2nd terms, 6 and —4, and multiply those together. Finally, we sum those two products to get the value
for the top spot in matrix XY, as shown below.

Top:

*X

3

=

a = (—5)(3) + (6)(—4) = —39

Chapter 19: Matrices

At this point, we should check the answer choices. We see that only answer choice D has 39 in the top position,
so we already know the correct answer is D. On the ACT, you almost never actually need to solve the entire
matrix, so check the answer choices right away after you find the value for any position in the matrix to save time.
For practice, let’s go over how to find the other values in matrix XY.
To solve for the middle spot in matrix XY, which is labeled as b below, we use the middle row in matrix X and the
column in matrix Y. We multiply the 1st terms, 2 and 3, together. We then go to the 2nd terms, —1 and —4, and

multiply those together. Finally, we sum those two products to get the value for the top spot in matrix XY, as
shown below.

Let Your Calculator Help!
Did you know that some calculators can do matrix multiplication for you? If you own a TI-83, TI-84,
TI-Nspire (non-CAS), or most versions of Casio calculators, your calculator can do matrix multiplication!
To learn how, go to YouTube and look up a tutorial. It is good to know how your calculator can help in
case you get stuck on test day.
We still recommend that you understand how matrix multiplication works and do not rely on your

calculator, as it is faster to solve matrices on test day with the methods we just learned. Additionally,
some matrix multiplication questions will involve variables that you cannot enter in your calculator.
