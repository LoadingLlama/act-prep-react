Chapter 8: Number Theory
Number theory is the study of the properties of numbers. In this chapter, we will review a variety of concepts
related to numbers and other related topics that appear on the ACT.

Types of Numbers

To start, let’s review the types of numbers that you need to know for test day. You need to memorize all the G)
definitions below.

e

Integers are whole numbers (Ex: —4, 3, 102).

e

Positive numbers are numbers that are greater than 0 (Ex: 1,2,3,4...).

e

Negative numbers are numbers that are less than 0 (Ex: —1, —-2, —3,—-4...).

e

Even numbers are numbers that are divisible by 2 (Ex: 2,4, 6,8...).

e

Odd numbers are numbers that are not divisible by 2 (Ex: 1,3,5, 7 ...).

e

Prime Numbers are integers that are only divisible by 1 and itself (Ex: 2, 3,5, 7,11...). Note
that 1 is not a prime number and 2 is the only prime even number.

e

Rational numbers are any number that can be expressed as a fraction (Ex: - — =). Any integer
or terminating decimal is also a rational number (Ex: —22, 36.5, 0.02).

e

Irrational numbers are any numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction (Ex: 7, V5).

e

Undefined numbers are numbers with a zero in the denominator (Ex: a7 ro

e

Imaginary numbers are real numbers multiplied by the imaginary unit i (Ex: —3i, 87).

Example 1: The solution to the equation 124 + 9x = —3x + 328 is a number that is

A.

Irrational

B. Negative and odd

C. Positive and prime

D. Positive and even

Solution: To solve for x, we need to combine like terms. We can move all the x-terms to the left side by
adding 3x to both sides, and we can move the numbers to the right side by subtracting 124 from both
sides.
124 + 9x = —3x + 328
9x + 3x = 328 — 124
12x
= 204
_ 204,

~~ 12 ~
The solution to the equation is 17. 17 is a positive, odd integer and a prime number. The answer is C.

Example 2: Let a be a positive integer and let x = Va. Which of the following expressions represents
a rational number for all values of a?

A>

Bx-1

C3x

Dx

Solution: A rational number must be able to be expressed as a fraction or be an integer. To tell which of

the answer choices is a rational number, we can plug in Va for x in each answer choice.
e

Ja

oo,

,

For A, we get ~~ Expressions with square roots are irrational numbers, so A is incorrect.

-61-

math

e

For B, we get Va — 1. Expressions with square roots are irrational, so B is incorrect.

e

ForC, we get 3Va. Again, square roots are irrational, so C is incorrect.

e

For D, we get (Va)? = a. When you square a square root, the square root disappears. a is an
integer, which is a rational number, so D is correct.

D is correct. All other answer choices have roots in the expression and are irrational.

Properties of Even and Odd Numbers
You should know the properties of even and odd numbers in the table below.

While these may seem simple, knowing these properties can help with questions that ask about even and odd

numbers.

Example 3: For the equation mn? + 3m = p, if m is a positive, even number and n is a negative, odd
number, p must be

A.

Negative andeven

B. Negative and odd

C. Positive andeven

D. Positive and odd

Solution: Method #1 — Substitution. The easiest way to solve this question is to use substitution and pick
numbers form and n. As long as we follow the rules in the question (m is positive and even, n is negative and
odd), we can pick any numbers. It is best to pick small numbers to make the algebra easier. Let’s pick m = 2
and n = —3. Now, we can plug our values for m and n into the equation and solve for p.

mn?
+ 3m =p

2(—3)? + 3(2) =p
2(9)+6=p
18+6=p
24=p

With our values, we got p = 24, which is a positive, even number, so we can see that C is correct. No matter
what numbers we select, as long as we follow the rules outlined in the question, p will always be positive and
even.

Method #2 — Rules of Even and Odd Numbers. We can also solve this question conceptually by using our
rules for odd and even numbers in the table above.

Let’s start by figuring out if p will be positive or negative. For the mn? term, m > 0 and n? > 0 (since
squared terms are always positive). A positive number multiplied by a positive number is always positive, so

mn? > 0. Sincem > 0,3m > 0. Since both mn? and 3m are positive, the sum of those terms will be
positive. p is positive.

Next, let’s find out if p is odd or even. Let’s start with the mn? term. We know that m is even, but what about
n7? n is odd, so n? is odd x odd, which is odd. So, mn? is even x odd, which is even. 3m is also going to

- 62
-

Chapter 8: Number Theory

be even, since 3m is odd x even, which is even. As a result, we see that mn? + 3m is even + even, which is
even. p is even.
Using our rules for even and odd numbers, we find that p is positive and even. C is the correct answer.
*Note: Solving questions like Example 3 conceptually is often much more difficult and time-consuming,
so we always recommend using substitution for questions like this if you can.

Greatest Common Factor
The greatest common factor of a set of numbers is the largest positive integer that divides evenly into all
numbers in the set with no remainder. For example, for the set of numbers 12, 18, and 30, the greatest

common factor is 6. 6 is the largest number that divides evenly into 12, 18, and 30.
Example 4: What is the greatest common factor for the set of numbers 56, 112, 182?
A. 2

B. 8

C.

14

D. 28

Solution: The easiest way to solve any greatest common factor question with numbers is to backsolve

using the answer choices. We are looking for the largest number that divides evenly into 56, 112, and 182.
To solve, all we need to do is grab a calculator and start with the largest value in the answer choices, which is
28. 28 divides evenly into 56 and 112 but does not divide evenly into 182, so 28 is incorrect. 14 divides
evenly into 56, 112, and 182, as we can see below:
56+14=4
112+14=8
182+14=13

The correct answer is C. 8 does not divide evenly into 182. 2 divides evenly into all 3 numbers but 2 is
smaller than 14, so 2 is not the greatest common factor.

For more advanced greatest common factor questions, the ACT can ask you to find the greatest common factor
for an expression with variables. For these questions, we are looking for the largest term that we can factor out
from all other terms. For a simple example to start, let’s consider the expression

3x2 + 6x

The greatest factor is 3x, because we can factor our 3x from both the 3x? term and the 6x term. If we factor
3x from 3x7, we have x left over. If we factor 3x from 6x, we have 2 left over. We can rewrite the
expression above as

3x(x + 2)
to show the greatest common factor, 3x, factored out from the original expression.

Example 5: What is the greatest monomial factor for the expression 3x?y — 12x? ?
A. 3x3

B. 3x?

C. 12x?y

D. x

Solution: To find the greatest monomial factor (monomial factor is just a fancy algebra word for an algebraic
expression with only one term), we need to find the largest number and variable(s) that we can factor out from
both terms.
Let’s start with the number. What is the largest number that we can factor out from both terms? The answer is
3 because both 3 and 12 are divisible by 3.

- 63
-

math

What about the variables? To factor out a variable, the variable must appear in all terms in the expression.

Since y only appears in the 3x?y term and not in the —12x term, we cannot factor y out from both terms.
Okay, so what about x? Ifa variable appears in all terms in the expression, we can factor out the lowest

power. The first term, 3x*y, has x? while the second term, —12x?, has x2. The lowest power is x2, so we
can factor out an x”.

Combining the number, 3, and variable, x’, that we factored out, we find the greatest monomial factor is 3x?.
We can rewrite the original expression as

3x2 (xy — 4)
to show the greatest monomial factor factored out from the original expression. The correct answer is B.

Least Common Multiple
The least common multiple is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all numbers in the set. For

example, the least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6 because 6 is the smallest number that is divisible by both 2
and 3.
A multiple of a number is when we multiply that number by another number. For example, the multiples of 4
are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and so on. Any positive number that is divisible by 41s a multiple of 4.

Example 6: What is the least common multiple for 5, 6, and 20?
A. 20

B. 30

C. 60

D.

120

Solution: To find the least common multiple, we can list the multiples of 5, 6, and 20 and look for the
smallest number that appears on all 3 lists.
Multiples of 5:

5,10, 15,20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50,55, 60, 65, 70...

Multiples of 6:

6,12, 18,24, 30, 36,42, 48, 54, 60, 66...

Multiples of 20:

20,40, 60,80...

We see the least common multiple is 60. While 120 and 3,000 are divisible by 5, 6, and 20, they are not the
smallest number that is a multiple of all 3 and therefore not the least common multiple. The answer is C.
Shortcut Solution: The fastest and easiest way to solve is to backsolve using the answer choices. We do
not recommend using the method above. However, it is important to understand the method above, as you
may need to use that method for other types of least common multiple questions.
To solve, grab your calculator, start with answer choice A, and see if the number is divisible by 5, 6, and 8.
Here, 20 is not divisible by 6, so we would next try 30. 30 is not divisible by 20, so we would move on to 60.
60 is divisible by all 5,6, and 20, so we know we found the answer. We are looking for the least common

multiple, so there is no need to even check any larger numbers once you find an answer choice that works.

Prime Factorization
Prime factorization is a method of expressing a number as a product of its prime factors. The most

common approach to prime factorization is making a factor tree. In the factor tree, we keep dividing numbers
and creating more branches until we are left with only prime numbers. Let’s start by finding the prime
factorization of 20.

The prime factors (2, 2, and 5) are shown in bold. To show the prime factorization of 20, we multiply all the
prime factors together, so the prime factorization of 20 is 2 x 2 x 5.
Example 7: Which of the following is the correct prime factorization of 6,006?
A. 2:3:+7:11:13

B.6:7-:11:13

C. 6:7:143

D. 7-11-13

Solution: To solve, we can set up a factor tree for 6,006.

xs
The dots in the answer choices are another way in math to show multiplication. From our factor tree, we see
the prime factors (shown in bold on the factor tree) are 2, 3, 7, 11, and 13. The answer is A.
All the other answer choices are incompletely factored or do not multiply to 6,006. In B and C, 6 is nota
prime number. In D, 7+ 11-13 does not multiply to 6,006.

The prime factorization shown above is only one example of a correct factor tree. Depending on the numbers
you divide by to start, you factor tree may look a bit different than the one above. For example, the first
branches from 6,006 could be 6 and 1,001. No matter how you start the tree, you will get the same prime
factorization as long as you do the math correctly and continue to divide the branches of the tree until you get
only prime numbers.

One Solution vs. Infinite Solutions vs. No Solution
We need to know how to tell when an algebraic expression will have one solution, infinite solutions, and
no solution. To start, let’s see how a question testing you on this topic might appear on the ACT.
Example 8: For the equation 3x — 8 = ax — 12, under which condition will there be no solution?

A.

a=0

B.a=3

C.ax#3

D.

a>0O

Before we come back to solve Example 8, let’s learn the rules for one solution, infinite solutions, and no
solution.

One Solution
Any algebraic expression that can be solved for a single value of x will have one solution. For example, if
we have the expression.
9x —2=5x+10

we can solve for x. Subtract 5x from both sides and add 2 to both sides to get:
4x =12
x=3

We get 1 solution for x. Memorize the rules below to know how to spot this quickly.
Rule for 1 Solution

The coefficients of the x-terms are different. The constants (numbers) can be the same or different.

Anytime the expression has x-terms with different coefficients and no higher powers of x, such as x?,
there is always 1 solution.

In the example we just solved, the x-terms, 9x and 5x have different coefficients, so, using the rule for 1
solution, we know there will be 1 solution without having to solve the equation.

Infinite Solutions
An algebraic expression with infinite solutions must be true for any value of x. For an equation to have

infinite solutions, both sides of the equation must be identical. Some examples of equations with infinite
solutions are below:

6x —12 = 6x-12

7x? = 7x?

x9—4*%4+5=x°-4x4+5

For the expressions above, we can plug any value for x and the expression will be true.
Rule for Infinite Solutions

Both sides of the equation must be identical. The coefficients of the x-terms and the constants

(numbers) must be the same. Anytime both sides of the expression are identical, any value of x makes
the expression true, so there are infinite solutions.

- 66
-

Chapter 8: Number Theory

No Solution
An algebraic expression with no solution cannot be solved for any value of x. For this to occur, the
expression must have the same coefficients for the variable(s) on both sides and the constants (numbers)

must be different. Some examples of equations with no solution are below:

x-2=x4+5

6x —12=6x+4+1

7x? = 7x* +10

No matter what value we plug in for x, we can never make any of the equations above true. Notice that the

terms with variables (the terms with x or x? in the above examples) are equal but the numbers are not.
Anytime an equation looks like this, there is no solution.
Rule for No Solution

The coefficients of the x-terms are the same. The constants (numbers) are different. Anytime we
see these characteristics in an algebraic expression, there is no solution.
Now that we know the rules, let’s go back to Example 8.

Example 8: For the expression 3x — 8 = ax — 12, under which condition will there be no solution?
A.

a=0

B.

a=3

C.a#3

D.

a>0

Solution: For there to be no solution, we need the coefficients of the x-terms to be the same and the constants
(numbers) to be different. In the equation above, the number are already different, so we just need to make the
coefficients of x-terms the same. For this to occur, we need a = 3 so the expression becomes
3x —8=3x-12

which has no solution. The answer is B.

Two Solutions for Algebraic Expressions
For a challenge question, the ACT can also include an algebraic expression that has two solutions. For an

algebraic expression to have 2 solutions, the equation must either (1) have an x*-term or (2) have an
x-term inside absolute value bars.

Two Solutions with an x2-term
Let’s say we are given the algebraic expression x* — 6 = —2. To solve, we could add 6 to both sides and
get

x? =4
Taking the square root of both sides we get.
x=+2

So, we get 2 solutions! Remember that in Chapter 7 (pg. 56) we learned that when we take the square root

of both sides with x2, we must put a + in front of the number.
Two Solutions with Absolute Value
Let’s say we are given the expression |x| + 3 = 10. To solve, we subtract 3 from both sides and get
Ix} =7

>-

x=7
and x=-7

When we have a variable inside the absolute value bars, there will be 2 solutions. If you are not
familiar with this topic, we will learn more about algebra with absolute values bars in Chapter 18.
