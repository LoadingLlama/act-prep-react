Chapter 11: Functions
A function is defined as a mathematical relationship between a variable x and the function f(x). For every
value of x, there is exactly one value of f(x). For any function, there will be an input, which appears as the
term in the parentheses of a function, and an output, which will be the value that f(x) equals.

Function Basics
In order to solve functions questions on the ACT, we first need to know where to properly plug in the input to
a function. For the function

fx) =5x-2
we plug in the input for x. You are likely used to the input being a number, but the input can include variables
as well. No matter what the input is, we plug it in for the x in the equation:

f(3) =5(3)-2=13

f(—2x) = 5(—2x) — 2

=-10x —2

f(a-—11)
= 5(a-—11) —2=5a—57

Example 1: If f(x) = 3Vx + 11, what is the value for f(25) ?
A.

15

B. 26

C. 34

D. 64

Solution: To solve, plug in the input to the function.

f(25) = 3V25 4-11 = 3(5) +11 =154+11 = 26
The answer is B.

Example 2: A function, f, is defined by f(x,y) = 4x — y?. What is the value of f (5, 2) ?
A.

—17

B. 9

C.

16

D. 24

Solution: This function sure looks weird, but we solve it in the exact same way as we just did except that now
we are given a value for x and y. To solve, plug in 5 for x and 2 for y.

f (5,2) =4(5) —22 =20-4=16
The answer is C.

Example 3: If f(x) = — for what value of x does f(x) =5?
A.

1

B. 2

C. 4

D.
5

Solution: If we are given the output, which is 5 in this question, and are asked to find the input, we plug in the

output for f(x) and solve for the input x.
10x

x+4

5(x + 4) = 10x
5x + 20 = 10x
20
= 5x
4=x
The answer is C.

Composite Functions
Quite often, the ACT will ask you to solve composite functions. A composite function is a function that is
written inside of another function. We will use the examples below to learn how to solve composite functions
questions correctly.

Example 4: If f(x) = 3x + 10 and g(x) = x — 5, what is the value of f(g(8)) ?
A.

3

B. 9

C.

19

D. 29

Solution: If you are asked to solve a composite function, there are two methods to solve: (1) solve for the
composite function or (2) work inside out. Both methods are shown below.

Method #1 - Solve for the composite function: In this question, we want to solve for the function f(g(x)).
To do so, we plug the entire g(x) function in for the x in the f(x) function.

f(g(x)) = 3( -—5) +10 = 3x-15+4+10 = 3x-5

Now that we know the composite function f ( g (x)) = 3x — 5, we can plug in 8 for x and solve.
f(g(8)) = 3(8)

-5 =24-5=19

The answer is C.

Method #2 - Work inside out: Rather than solve for the composite function, we can also work from the

inside out to solve for

f(g(8)). To start, we can solve for g(8).
g(8) = 8-5=3

We now know that g(8) = 3, so we can simplify the function we are solving for.

f(g(8)) =f)
Now, we just solve for f(3).

f(3) = 38) +10=19
The answer is C.

Both of these methods work for any composite function questions on the ACT, so you should use the one that
you are more comfortable with.

Example 5: If f(x) = 2x? — 7 and g(x) = x + 3, what is f(g(x —1))?
A. 2x? +2

B.

2x7+8x+1

C.

2x*+12x+4+11

D. 2x2 -3

Solution: This question looks more difficult since we now have x — 1 as the input, but we should still treat
this as a composite function. Both of the methods outlined in Example 4 will work to solve. Below, we will

use the inside out method. First, we can solve for g(x — 1):

g(x—-1) =(*-1)+3=x+2

We now know that g(x — 1) = x + 2, so we can simplify what we are solving for.

f(g@-1)) =f +2)
Now, we solve for f(x + 2).

f(«+2) =2(« +2)? -—7 = 2007 4+4x44)-7 = 2x7 4+8x4+8-7 = 2x74+8x41

f(g(x —1)) = 2x?+8x+1
The answer is B.

**Common Mistake to Avoid: Remember that (x + 2)? # x* + 4. You need to multiply out the term
because (x + 2)? is the same as (x + 2)(x + 2).

Other Function Notations
Do you know what (f ° g)(x) or (fg)(x) means? If not, you are not alone. Most students we work with see
these other function notations and are confused about what to do. No need to worry though! All of the other
function notations that can come up on test day are in the table below. If you memorize what these notations
mean, you will be prepared to solve any questions with them on test day.

Example 6: If f(x) = 2x? + 1 and g(x) = x? — 1, which of the following expressions represents

(fa)(x)?
A.

3x?

B. 2x?2-1

C. 2x*-1

D. 2x*-x?-1

Solution: (fg)(x) is the same as f(x) x g(x), so we need to multiply the functions together.

(fg) (x) = (2x? + 1I)(x* — 1)
To solve, we need to multiply these quadratics together by FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last). If you need to
review how this works, you can go to Chapter 16.

(fg)(x) = (2x? +1)(x* -1) = 2x*- 2x72? +x%-1= 2x4*-x%-1
The answer is D.

Example 7: Let (f ° g)(x) = (2x + 1)? — 3 and g(x) = 2x + 1. Which of the following expressions
defines (g ° f)(x) ?

A.

2x?-—2

B. 2x2-—5

C. v2x+1+3

D.

v2x+1-1

Solution: On more difficult questions, the ACT will give you a puzzle question with functions. These are
challenging to solve and normally appear in the last 10 questions of the test.

To solve this question, we first need to remember that (f ° g)(x) = f(g(x)). We also know that
g(x) = 2x + 1, so we can plug in 2x + 1 for g(x) and get

(fog) (x) = f(g@)) = f(x +1)

math

The input of 2x + 1 is plugged in for x in the function f(x) we are trying to find. Since we know that

Cf

°g)(x) = (2x + 1)? — 3, we can replace 2x + 1 with x to work backwards and find f(x). We get

f(x) =x? -3.

Now that we know f (x), we can find (g ° f)(x). Again, remember that (g ° f)(x) is the same as g( f (x)).
To solve, we need to plug f (x), which is x* — 3, into g(x)

— 3) = 2(x? —3)+1=2x?-5
(g°f)() = g(f(x)) = g(x?

The answer is B.

Functions on Graphs
When a function is graphed, the input, x, is on the x-axis and the output, f(x), is on the y-axis. Another
way to better understand how functions appear on a graph is to remember that for any linear function

f(x)=mx+b

isthesameas

y=mx+b

When graphing a function f(x), you can think of f(x) as the y-coordinate and x as the x-coordinate. Using

the input as x and the output as y, we can find points in the standard (x, y) plane and graph any function.
Example 8:

The function f(x) is shown in the standard (x, y) coordinate plane above. What is the minimum value of
this function?
A.

—2

B. -1

C. 6

D. 1

Solution: The minimum value of the function is the point(s) on the graph where y-coordinate is smallest. In

the function above, the minimum value is where y = —2, so the answer is A.
What if this question instead asked for the maximum value of the function? Well, now we just look for the
highest point on the graph, which is at y = 6.
Easy right? For any questions asking for the minimum or maximum value of a function, you just need to look

at the graph and find the smallest or largest y-value.

The function f(x) = 4 cos(7x) + 1 is graphed in the standard (x, y) coordinate plane above. How many
x-intercepts does the graph of the function have on the interval 0 << x <4?
A.

1

B. 2

C. 3

D.
4

Solution: To find the number of x-intercepts on the graph of the function, we count the number of times the
function crosses the x-axis. We see the function crossing the x-axis 4 times, so the answer is D.

Domain and Range
Another common type of common functions question will ask you about the domain or range of a function.
e

Domain: The set of all possible input, x, values to a function.

e

Range: The set of all output, y, values to a function.

If you are looking at the graph of a function, the domain is all the x-values that appear on the graph and
the range is all the y-values that appear on the graph.

To see how this works, let’s find the domain and range of the graph below.

We see x-values on the graph from x = —1 to x = 3, so for the graph above the domain is {-1 < x < 3}.
Since the dots on the graph are solid, we include —1 and 3 in the domain and use the less than or equal to and
greater than or equal to signs. If the dots were open, the domain would instead use the greater than and less

than signs and would be {—1 < x < 3}. .
We see y-values on the graph from y = —2 to y = 4, so for the graph above the range is {—2 < y < 4}.

Example 10:

The graph of f(x) = 3sin(27x) — 3 is shown above. What is the range of f(x) ?
A.

-6<y<0

B.-3<y<0

C-3<y<3

DO0<ys<3

Solution: To solve, look for the y-values on the graph. We see y-values from y = —6 to y = 0, so the range
of f(x) is -—6 < y <0. The answer is A.
Example 11:

The graph f(x) =

A. fyly #1}

(x—4)(x-2)
(x—-1)(x-2)

is shown above. What is the range of f(x) ?

B. fyly #4}

OC. fyly#-—2andy #1}

D. {y| #0andy #1}

Solution: Looking at this graph, you might notice there is a horizontal invisible line at y = 1 the graph
approaches but never crosses. We call this a horizontal asymptote at y = 1. Because there are no points
on the graph where y = 1, the range of the function will not include y = 1. All points above the horizontal
asymptotes y = 1 appear on the graph, but what about below?

Do you see that open dot at the point (2,—2)? We call this point a hole in the graph. Holes occur when the

numerator and denominator of a function both equal 0. If we plug in x = 2 to f(x), we will get f(2) = =.
We can also spot that there is going to be a hole at x = 2 because we see (x — 2) in the numerator and
denominator. When the same term appears in the numerator and denominator, it always creates a
hole. Holes in the graph are undefined and are never included in the domain.
But a hole does not automatically mean the value is not included in the range, as there could be another point
with the y-value elsewhere on the graph. In the graph above, however, there is no point where y = 2, so it
is also not included in the range.
As a result, we see that the function includes all y-values except at y = 1 (the horizontal asymptote) and

y = —2 (the hole). In fancy math terms, this would appear as {y|y # —2 and y ¥ 1}, which means all
values of y except y = —2 and y = 1. The answer is C.
Horizontal asymptotes are rarely tested on the ACT, but you should still know how to solve for them just in
case. If you need to review asymptotes, the rules for solving them are covered in Chapter 35.

Chapter 11: Functions

Continuing to look at the graph in Example 11, you can see there is a vertical invisible line at x = 1 that the
graph approaches but never crosses. There is no point on the graph when x = 1. We call this a vertical
asymptote at x = 1. Because there is no point on the graph where x = 1, the domain of the function will
not include x = 1. We will also cover the rules for vertical asymptotes in Chapter 35.
There is also an open dot at x = 2. We call this point a hole in the graph. Holes are not included in the
domain since there 1s no point where x = 2 on the graph. All other values for x appear on the graph, so the

domain is all values of x except x # 1 and x # 2. Mathematically, the domain could be written as

{x|x # 1 and
x # 2}.
Vertical asymptotes occur when the denominator of a function is equal to 0. If we plug in x = 1 to

f(x), we get f(1) = =, which is undefined. Again, since vertical asymptotes are points where the function
is undefined, they are never included in the domain.
What if you are not given a picture graph in the question? To solve for vertical asymptotes, you set the
denominator equal to zero and solve. If there is a hole in the graph, such as the one at x = 2 in example
11, we cancel those terms. So for the graph in example 11, the only term left in the denominator is x — 1.
To find the vertical asymptote, we set x — 1 equal to 0 and solve.
x—-1=0
x=1

We see there is a vertical asymptote at x = 1. Even if we were not given the graph, we could easily solve
for any vertical asymptotes. Remember vertical asymptotes are points where the graph is undefined and are
not included in the domain.

Example 12: The domain of f(x) = —— is the set of all real numbers EXCEPT:
A.

2

B. —3

C. 2 and
3

D. —2 and
3

Solution: Whenever you are asked about the domain and see a fraction in a function, look for where the
function is undefined. To make the function undefined, set the denominator equal to 0 and solve for x.

x*—5x+6=0
(x —2)(x-—3)=0
x=2,3

f(x) is undefined when x = 2 and x = 3, so these points are not included in the domain of the function. If
we graphed f(x), we would see vertical asymptotes at x = 2 and x = 3. The answer is C.

Example 13: Two real-valued functions are defined as f(x) = Vx + 1 and g(x) = x — 3. What is the
domain of f(g(x)) ?
A.

[0,0)

B. [3, 0)

C. [5, 0)

D. [—©, co)

Solution: First, we need to solve for f (g(x)) by plugging g(x) into f(x).

f(g(x))

=vx-3+4+1

Now, we need to learn how the domain is restricted with a square root. Values underneath a square root
must be greater than or equal to 0. Any value of x that makes the term underneath the square root negative
cannot be included in the domain. To find the domain with a square root, set the term underneath the
square root greater than or equal to zero and solve for x.
x—-32>0

95
-

math

x>3

The domain of f(g(x)) is x = 3. Written in interval notation, this is [ 3,00). The answer is B.

To illustrate why the domain is restricted, let’s plug in x = 1, which is not part of the domain, to f(g(x))
and see what happens.

f(gQ)) =v1-34+1= V-24+1
You cannot have a negative term underneath the square root, so x = 1 has no real number output and
therefore cannot be included in the domain.
If you need to review vertical and horizontal asymptotes or just want more practice, go to Chapter 35.

Inverse Functions
Inverse functions, written as

f~1(x), are rarely tested on the ACT, but they are pretty easy to solve, so let’s go

over them just in case you see an inverse functions question on test day. To find the inverse of any function,

switch the input x and the output f(x) and solve for f(x). Let’s see how this works in the example below.
Example 14: Given the function f(x) = —<—. what is the value for f~1(6.5) ?

A.
7

B-=

C. =

D.
2

Solution: To find the inverse, we switch the input x and the output f(x). Most students find it easiest to start
by replacing f(x) with y, so our function becomes
_ 10x —7

a)
To find the inverse, switch the x and y and then solve for y.
10y —7
x

2

2x = 10y—7
2x +7=10y
2x +7

10.”
Once we have solved for y, we have found the inverse function. So, we can replace y with f~*(x).

f4G) =

2Xx+7
10

Now that we know the inverse, we can find f~1(6.5) by plugging in 6.5
“apex

2065) +7

20_

f-*(6.5) = 790 = 10> 2
f-4(6.5) = 2
The answer is D.
