## üéØ LESSON ASSIGNMENT METHODOLOGY

### Intelligent Content Analysis
Each question was analyzed using advanced pattern matching:

1. **Question Stem Analysis**
   - Keywords: "delete", "add", "most effective", "placement"
   - Purpose indicators: "primary purpose", "best accomplish"
   - Structural markers: "suppose the writer"

2. **Underlined Text Analysis**
   - Punctuation patterns: commas, semicolons, colons, dashes
   - Verb forms: tense, agreement, auxiliary verbs
   - Pronouns: who/whom, which/that, agreement
   - Modifiers: placement, dangling, misplaced

3. **Answer Choice Analysis**
   - Transition words: however, therefore, moreover
   - DELETE options indicating redundancy
   - Parallel structure in lists
   - Verb tense variations

4. **Math Content Analysis**
   - Topic keywords: area, volume, slope, probability
   - Mathematical symbols: ‚àö, %, |x|, <, >
   - Question type classification

5. **Reading/Science Strategy Mapping**
   - Passage-based question types
   - Data interpretation vs experimental design
   - Evaluation vs investigation questions

### Lesson Matching Algorithm
```
FOR each question:
  1. Extract question features (stem, underlined, choices)
  2. Apply pattern matching rules
  3. Score against lesson topic keywords
  4. Select highest-scoring lesson
  5. Fallback to category-based default if no strong match
```
