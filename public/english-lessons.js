            <h3>Welcome to ACT Prep!</h3>
            <p>The ACT is a standardized test that measures your knowledge and skills in English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science. Understanding the test format and developing effective strategies are crucial for success.</p>
            
            <h3>Test Structure</h3>
            <p>The ACT consists of four main sections:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>English (45 minutes, 75 questions):</strong> Tests grammar, usage, punctuation, and rhetorical skills</li>
                <li><strong>Mathematics (60 minutes, 60 questions):</strong> Covers algebra, geometry, and trigonometry</li>
                <li><strong>Reading (35 minutes, 40 questions):</strong> Tests reading comprehension across various subjects</li>
                <li><strong>Science (35 minutes, 40 questions):</strong> Evaluates interpretation and analysis of scientific data</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Scoring</h3>
            <p>Each section is scored from 1-36, and your composite score is the average of all four sections. Most colleges consider a score of 20+ competitive, while top universities typically look for scores of 30+.</p>
            
            <h3>Study Strategy</h3>
            <p>Effective ACT preparation involves:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Taking a diagnostic test to identify strengths and weaknesses</li>
                <li>Focusing study time on areas that need the most improvement</li>
                <li>Learning test-specific strategies and time management techniques</li>
                <li>Taking multiple practice tests to build stamina and familiarity</li>
                <li>Reviewing mistakes and understanding why correct answers are right</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Remember: consistent, focused practice is more effective than cramming. Start with your weakest areas and gradually build confidence across all sections.</p>

        title: 'Chapter 1: Sentence Structure',
        content: `
            <p class="lesson-intro">To conquer the ACT English Test, we first need to identify the different parts of a sentence and know the rules for how they can and cannot be combined.</p>
            
            <h3>Clauses and Phrases</h3>
            <p>A <strong>clause</strong> is a group of words that contains both a subject and a verb. There are two types of clauses: independent clauses and dependent clauses.</p>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Independent Clauses</h4>
                <p>An <strong>independent clause</strong> can stand as a sentence by itself. It always has a subject and a verb. The best way to identify an independent clause is to read the sentence and see if you can stop talking at the end. If you can stop, it is a complete sentence and an independent clause.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples of independent clauses:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The dog chased its tail.</li>
                    <li>Monique made some homemade peach scones for breakfast.</li>
                    <li>He picked it up.</li>
                    <li>The excited child opened up his present.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Dependent Clauses</h4>
                <p>A <strong>dependent clause</strong> cannot stand alone as a complete sentence. Most often, clauses become dependent by adding a subordinating conjunction to the front of the clause.</p>
                <p><strong>Common subordinating conjunctions:</strong> after, although, as, because, before, even though, if, in order to, once, since, though, that, unless, until, whatever, when, whenever, whether, where, while</p>
                <p><strong>Examples of dependent clauses:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>While the dog chased its tail...</li>
                    <li>Although Monique made some homemade peach scones for breakfast...</li>
                    <li>Since he picked it up...</li>
                    <li>When the excited child opened up his present...</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Phrases</h4>
                <p>A <strong>phrase</strong> lacks a subject or verb or both. A phrase does not express a complete thought and can never stand alone as a sentence. As a result, phrases provide additional descriptive information in a sentence.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples of phrases:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chasing its tail... (missing the subject)</li>
                    <li>Making some homemade peach scones for breakfast... (missing the subject)</li>
                    <li>Picking it up... (missing the subject)</li>
                    <li>Excited to open up his present... (missing the subject)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>TIP – Independent vs. Dependent Clauses vs. Phrases</h4>
                <p>To tell the difference between an independent clause, a dependent clause, and a phrase, read the sentence out loud (or "out loud" in your head). If you can stop talking at the end of the sentence, it is an independent clause. If you feel like you need to keep talking, the sentence is a dependent clause or a phrase and cannot stand alone.</p>
                <p>To tell the difference between a dependent clause and a phrase, cover the first word and read the rest of the sentence. If you then have a complete sentence, it is a dependent clause. If you do not have a complete sentence, it is a phrase.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Independent Clause:</strong> My brother Adam eats cookies every day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dependent Clause:</strong> When my brother Adam eats cookies every day...</li>
                    <li><strong>Phrase:</strong> Eating cookies every day...</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Sentence Fragments</h3>
            <p>A complete sentence must contain a subject and a verb. <strong>Sentence fragments</strong> are missing a subject or a verb (or both) and do not express a complete thought. In other words, a sentence fragment cannot stand by itself.</p>
            <p>To spot sentence fragments, read the entire sentence. The sentence will usually just sound plain wrong, and you will realize it is missing a subject or a verb.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> The student running to get to class on time. <em>(missing a verb – what did the student do?)</em></p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The student running to get to class on time dropped her water bottle.</p>
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Excited to go to the beach and surf. <em>(missing a subject – who is excited to go to the beach?)</em></p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> My little brother Shaun is excited to go to the beach and surf.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>The 5 Rules for Compound Sentences</h3>
            <p>Often on the ACT, we face more complex sentences that have multiple clauses (more than one subject and verb). These are called compound sentences. On the ACT (and in English in general), multiple clauses must always appear as one of the 5 types below.</p>
            
            <div class="fanboys-tip">
                <h4>TIP – FANBOYS</h4>
                <p><strong>Memorize these 7 special words!</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>F</strong>or</li>
                    <li><strong>A</strong>nd</li>
                    <li><strong>N</strong>or</li>
                    <li><strong>B</strong>ut</li>
                    <li><strong>O</strong>r</li>
                    <li><strong>Y</strong>et</li>
                    <li><strong>S</strong>o</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>The 5 Types of Compound Sentences:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Two separate independent clauses with periods.</strong><br>
                        <em>Mary loves dogs. Andrew loves cats.</em><br>
                        <span class="clause-label">Independent → Independent</span></li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Comma + FANBOYS joining 2 independent clauses.</strong><br>
                        <em>Mary loves dogs, and Andrew loves cats.</em><br>
                        <span class="clause-label">Independent → Independent</span></li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Semicolon between 2 independent clauses.</strong><br>
                        <em>Mary loves dogs; Andrew loves cats.</em><br>
                        <span class="clause-label">Independent → Independent</span><br>
                        <em>*A semicolon is the same as a period on the ACT.</em></li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Dependent clause followed by independent clause (comma).</strong><br>
                        <em>While Mary loves dogs, Andrew loves cats.</em><br>
                        <span class="clause-label">Dependent → Independent</span></li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Independent clause straight into dependent clause (no comma).</strong><br>
                        <em>Mary loves dogs while Andrew loves cats.</em><br>
                        <span class="clause-label">Independent → Dependent</span></li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            
            <p><strong>You need to memorize these 5 rules!</strong> The ACT will challenge you by putting answer choices that "look" or "sound" good on the exam but actually break one of our rules above.</p>
            
            <h3>Comma Splices</h3>
            <p>A comma by itself <strong>CANNOT</strong> be used to join two independent clauses. Joining two independent sentences with only a comma is called a <strong>comma splice</strong> and is always incorrect.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> It is believed that bulls are enraged by the color red, they are actually colorblind.</p>
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> I cannot believe you did not get the flowers, I left them at your front door.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Both of these sentences are comma splices. We can correct these comma splices using any of our 5 rules above. The first incorrect sentence is corrected below using all 5 rules:</p>
            
            <div class="correction-box">
                <p><strong>Rule #1:</strong> It is believed that bulls are enraged by the color red. They are actually colorblind.</p>
                <p><strong>Rule #2:</strong> It is believed that bulls are enraged by the color red, but they are actually colorblind.</p>
                <p><strong>Rule #3:</strong> It is believed that bulls are enraged by the color red; they are actually colorblind.</p>
                <p><strong>Rule #4:</strong> While it is believed that bulls are enraged by the color red, they are actually colorblind.</p>
                <p><strong>Rule #5:</strong> It is believed that bulls are enraged by the color red though they are actually colorblind.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>How to Spot Sentence Structure Questions</h4>
                <p>Sentence structure questions usually have at least one of the following characteristics:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Periods, semicolons, commas, and FANBOYS are in the answer choices.</strong> If you see answer choices with any of these, you are most likely looking at a sentence structure question.</li>
                    <li><strong>Some answer choices have a subject or verb and others do not.</strong> For more advanced sentence structure questions, some answer choices have subjects or verbs while others do not. The verbs may also vary in their forms; for example, one answer choice may say "drove" while another says "driving."</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Your Approach for Sentence Structure Questions</h3>
            <p>Anytime you spot a sentence structure question, use the following approach:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Find where the sentence is being "split."</li>
                <li>Look left and right of the "split" point and identify the clauses or phrases.</li>
                <li>Apply the sentence structure rules.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <div class="practice-box">
                <h4>Practice Example</h4>
                <p><em>The roller coaster is opening next week, the wait time is expected to be over 4 hours long.</em></p>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> Which choice makes the sentence most grammatically acceptable?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A. NO CHANGE</li>
                    <li>B. week; with the</li>
                    <li>C. week and the</li>
                    <li>D. week. The</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> D – We have two independent clauses, so we need to separate them with a period. Option A is a comma splice.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-takeaway">
                <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
                <p>Master these five rules for combining clauses, and you'll be able to handle even the most complex sentence structure questions on the ACT. Remember: if you see punctuation in the answer choices, you're likely dealing with sentence structure!</p>

    'commas': {
        title: 'Chapter 2: Commas - 4 Types',
        content: `
            <p class="lesson-intro">Commas are the most common type of punctuation on the English Test. In order to successfully handle comma questions, we need to become familiar with the 4 types of commas that appear on the ACT.</p>
            
            <h3>The Four Types of Commas on the ACT</h3>
            <p>So far, we have already discussed the first two types of commas from Chapter 1:</p>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>1. Comma + FANBOYS</h4>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> My alarm clock did not go off this morning, so I arrived late at school.</p>
                <p>Use a comma and a FANBOYS (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) to join two independent clauses.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>2. Dependent clause followed by independent clause</h4>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> While electronic music has become very popular, many people still prefer classic rock.</p>
                <p>If a sentence has a dependent clause followed by an independent clause, you must link these with a comma.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Next, we will learn the other 2 types of commas in English and on the ACT:</p>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>3. Unnecessary Information</h4>
                <p>Commas are used to separate unnecessary information from the rest of the sentence. Information is unnecessary if we can remove it without fundamentally changing the meaning of the sentence. Unnecessary information can be as short as a single word or as long as a lengthy phrase.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Mrs. Ellison, who is known for giving pop quizzes, is my least favorite teacher.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> The snowboard in the closet, the one with no stickers on it, needs to be waxed.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> The basketball team, though, did not mount a comeback this week.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>4. Listing</h4>
                <p>Commas are used when listing more than two items and with lists of multiple adjectives modifying the same noun.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> The group at the picnic table ordered coconut shrimp, hot wings, and onion rings.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> The old, limping dog still managed to complete the 3-mile hike.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>TIP – The "Crossing-Out" Trick</h4>
                <p>For unnecessary information commas, you must be able to completely remove the unnecessary information from the sentence. After removing the unnecessary information, what remains must still be a complete sentence that can stand by itself.</p>
                <p><strong>To test if information is unnecessary:</strong> cross out the information and read the sentence without it. If you can cross out the information and the sentence still reads as a complete sentence, the information is unnecessary and needs to be set apart by a comma or commas.</p>
                <p>Let's test with this sentence: <em>The wooden beam, set at an angle, created an optical illusion.</em></p>
                <p>Crossing out "set at an angle": <em>The wooden beam created an optical illusion.</em> ✓ This works!</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Unnecessary Information Commas</h3>
            <p>The most common type of comma in English and on the ACT separates unnecessary information from the rest of the sentence. Information is unnecessary if we can remove the information from the sentence without fundamentally changing the meaning of the sentence.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Sitting behind the table,</strong> Mark waited to jump out and surprise his mother.</p>
                <p>Dale grabbed his favorite surfboard, <strong>the blue and green one,</strong> and paddled out.</p>
                <p>Buddy the Elf handed his father a bag of spaghetti, <strong>his face covered in syrup.</strong></p>
                <p>The real winner, <strong>however,</strong> had yet to be revealed.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>In the sentences above, the unnecessary information is in bold. Each of these sentences still works if we ignore unnecessary information. That's how we know it is unnecessary and the commas are correct!</p>
            
            <h3>Unnecessary vs. Necessary Information</h3>
            <p>At times, we will also need to determine if information is indeed unnecessary or not. These sentences are more challenging, but the trick is to delete the portion that may be unnecessary and see if the sentence loses any critical information.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The dresses that need to be hemmed are hanging in the closet.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Judith, who went to fashion school, designs dresses for a living.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Why do we have no commas in the first sentence and commas for the second? In the first sentence, the information is necessary. If we just say, "the dresses are hanging in the closet," then we do not know which specific dresses we are talking about. In the second sentence, we already know who designs the dresses, so the information about Judith going to fashion school is unnecessary.</p>
            
            <h3>The Names Rule</h3>
            <p>The ACT loves to ask you how to properly punctuate names. You are almost guaranteed to see at least one commas and names question on test day.</p>
            
            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>The Names Rule</h4>
                <p>The names rule has to do with <strong>specificity</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>If the identifier before the name is not specific to one person</strong> (friend, American physicist, Olympic gold medalist, high school principal), the name is necessary, and there is <strong>no comma</strong> between the identifier and the name.</li>
                    <li><strong>If the identifier is specific to one person</strong> (best friend, youngest sister, Amazon CEO), the name is unnecessary information, and there are <strong>commas around the name</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> My friend Kelly recently moved to London.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> My best friend, Andrew, is a certified scuba diver.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>In the first sentence, Kelly is necessary because without her name we do not know which friend recently moved to London. In the second sentence, Andrew is unnecessary because a person can only have one best friend. We do not need the name Andrew to know who we are talking about.</p>
            
            <h3>"That" vs. "Which" Phrases</h3>
            
            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>Key Rule:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Phrases that start with "that" never get commas.</strong> "That" phrases are always necessary information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Phrases that start with "which" always get commas.</strong> "Which" phrases are always unnecessary information.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The dogs that live down the street are always barking.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> My neighbor's dogs, which are always barking, love to play fetch.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Anytime you see "which," there must be a comma right in front of it. The exception is when "which" is part of a prepositional phrase like "on which," "in which" or "of which."</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The table on which the food was resting tipped over.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The table, which the food was resting on, tipped over.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>"ing" and "ed" Phrases</h3>
            <p>Phrases that start with "ing" and "ed" may or may not be separated with commas. To determine if these phrases, which are called participle phrases, get commas or not, determine if the information in the phrase is necessary to the sentence or not. On the ACT, "ing" and "ed" phrases most commonly appear with commas and are unnecessary information.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Excited for the car ride, Jane's bulldog started to jump up and down.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Jane's bulldog, excited for the car ride, started to jump up and down.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Marcus applied for the internship, hoping that he would get the position.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Judy laid down, exhausted from the long workout.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>"ing" and "ed" phrases can also be necessary information when the phrase is helping to specify who or what the noun is. If the phrase is necessary, there are no commas.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The politician waving to the crowd is predicted to win the election.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The yoga pants advertised on the front page of the website were sold out.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Prepositional Phrases</h3>
            <p>Prepositional phrases are phrases consisting of a preposition and its object. Some of the most common prepositions on the ACT are:</p>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Common Prepositions</h4>
                <p><strong>in</strong> • <strong>of</strong> • <strong>to</strong> • <strong>for</strong> • <strong>with</strong> • <strong>on</strong> • <strong>at</strong> • <strong>from</strong> • <strong>by</strong> • <strong>about</strong> • <strong>as</strong> • <strong>into</strong> • <strong>like</strong> • <strong>through</strong> • <strong>after</strong> • <strong>over</strong> • <strong>between</strong> • <strong>during</strong> • <strong>before</strong> • <strong>among</strong> • <strong>around</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>Prepositional Phrase Rules</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Prepositional phrases at the front of the sentence are always followed by a comma.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Prepositional phrases in the middle or end of a sentence almost never have commas around them.</strong> Most prepositional phrases contain essential information.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> On my way to work, I listened to my new favorite podcast.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> After cleaning the garage, Ralph started weeding the garden.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The clothing on the bed is for vacation. The clothing on the floor is being donated.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>On the ACT, 99% of prepositional phrases do not have commas, so in general you should never put commas around a prepositional phrase.</p>
            
            <h3>Transitional Words and Phrases Like "However"</h3>
            <p>On the ACT, there are certain words and short phrases that often give students trouble on grammar questions. We prefer to think of these as transitional words and phrases like "however."</p>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Common Transitional Words and Phrases</h4>
                <p><strong>However</strong> • <strong>Though</strong> • <strong>Therefore</strong> • <strong>Instead</strong> • <strong>Likewise</strong> • <strong>Nevertheless</strong> • <strong>Regardless</strong> • <strong>Moreover</strong> • <strong>Subsequently</strong> • <strong>Furthermore</strong> • <strong>In addition</strong> • <strong>As a result</strong> • <strong>Of course</strong> • <strong>Otherwise</strong> • <strong>For example</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>Three Ways Transitional Words Can Appear:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>At the front of the sentence followed by a comma.</strong><br>
                        <em>However, the truth would not be revealed until next week.</em></li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Separated by commas in the middle of a sentence.</strong><br>
                        <em>The truth, however, would not be revealed until next week.</em></li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Separated by a semicolon and a comma when between two independent clauses.</strong><br>
                        <em>I expected to pay over $100 for my new hiking boots; however, I found a sale and got them for half of the original price.</em></li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>How to Spot Unnecessary Information Commas Questions</h4>
                <p>Unnecessary information commas questions always have two defining characteristics:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>The words in all 4 answer choices are the exact same.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>The only difference in the answer choices is where commas are located.</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Anytime we see a question like this, we are dealing with an unnecessary information commas question and should use the "crossing-out" trick.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Listing Commas</h3>
            <p>The easiest types of commas on the English Test are listing commas. Listing commas can appear in a multiple item list and between lists of multiple adjectives describing the same noun.</p>
            
            <h3>Commas and Lists</h3>
            <p>Listing commas are used to separate the items in a list of 3 or more items.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> I went to the grocery store to pick up chicken, cheese, and bread.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> I went to the grocery store to pick up chicken, cheese and bread.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>The final comma in a list of items is called the Oxford comma. Use of the Oxford comma is stylistic, so technically both lists with and without the Oxford comma are correct. As a result, the Oxford comma alone will never make an answer choice correct or incorrect on the ACT.</p>
            
            <p>Lists must have 3 or more items to include commas. Be sure that you do not use commas in a list of just two items.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> The food was both incredibly savory, and overwhelmingly satisfying.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The food was both incredibly savory and overwhelmingly satisfying.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Adjective Lists with and without Commas</h3>
            <p>Listing commas are also used to separate a list of multiple adjectives modifying the same noun.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The wet, smelly dog was excited for the car ride home.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The narrow, winding, treacherous roads through the mountains are difficult to drive.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>On more difficult questions, we will need to know when to use commas in lists of adjectives and when commas are not necessary.</p>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>TIP – "The Switching Trick"</h4>
                <p>When you see multiple adjectives modifying a noun, switch the order of the adjectives to test whether or not you need a comma between the adjectives.</p>
                <p><strong>Rule:</strong> If you can switch the order of the adjectives without changing the meaning of the sentence, put a comma between the adjectives. If switching the order changes the meaning or makes no sense, there is no comma between the adjectives.</p>
                <p><strong>In short: If you can switch the adjectives, put a comma. No switch, no comma.</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Test:</strong> The sweet cold ice cream was refreshing.</p>
                <p><strong>Switch test:</strong> The cold sweet ice cream was refreshing. ✓ Works!</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The sweet, cold ice cream was refreshing.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Test:</strong> Elliot had to take off his stainless steel necklace.</p>
                <p><strong>Switch test:</strong> Elliot had to take off his steel stainless necklace. ✗ Doesn't work!</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Elliot had to take off his stainless steel necklace.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>The "1-Comma" Rule</h4>
                <p>When a sentence has only one comma in the middle, there must be an independent clause before or after the comma but not both and not neither. The only exception to this rule is a comma + FANBOYS linking two independent clauses.</p>
                <p>If before and after are both independent, we have a comma splice. If neither is independent, we have a sentence fragment.</p>
                <p>This rule helps you answer some of the most difficult sentence structure/commas questions correctly!</p>

                <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
                <p>Master these four comma types and you'll handle the majority of punctuation questions on the ACT English test. Remember: when you see comma placement in the answer choices, identify which of the four comma rules applies, then apply the appropriate test (crossing-out trick, switching trick, etc.).</p>

        content: `
            <p class="lesson-intro">Beyond commas, the ACT tests several other important punctuation marks. Each has specific rules and uses that you must master to succeed on the English section.</p>
            
            <h3>Semicolons</h3>
            <p>Semicolons are used to separate two independent clauses. On the ACT, just remember that:</p>
            
            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>Key Rule: Semicolon = Period</h4>
                <p>If we can replace a semicolon with a period, then it is used correctly! In other words, everything before the semicolon must stand as a complete sentence on its own, and everything after the semicolon must stand as a complete sentence on its own.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> My boss called me; asking that I pick up coffee for him.<br>
                <em>(2nd half of the sentence is not an independent clause)</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> After my boss called me; he asked that I pick up coffee for him.<br>
                <em>(1st half of sentence is not an independent clause)</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> My boss called me, he asked that I pick up coffee for him.<br>
                <em>(comma splice – cannot connect two independent clauses with a comma)</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> My boss called me; he asked that I pick up coffee for him.<br>
                <em>(two independent clauses separated by a semicolon)</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Colons</h3>
            <p>A colon can be used to introduce a list of multiple items, a list of one item, an example, an explanation, a clarification, or a definition.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> I went to the grocery store to pick up some items for dinner: chicken, cheese, and onions.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> I went to the market to get lunch: a turkey sandwich.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> He got what he deserved: a one-week suspension without pay.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Chocolate milk is a great recovery drink after a hard workout: it has the carbohydrates and proteins that muscles need to recover.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>Three Basic Rules for Colons:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>The part of the sentence before a colon must be an independent clause.</strong> If the part of the sentence before the colon cannot stand as a complete sentence by itself, it is always incorrect.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Everything after a colon must consist of only the items in the list, an example, an explanation, a clarification, or a definition.</strong> The sentence cannot continue to other topics.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Colons are NEVER used with "including," "such as," and "for example."</strong> If you ever see a colon before or after any of these, it is always incorrect!</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> The slide showing the most popular car colors in 2018: white, gray, and black.<br>
                <em>(not an independent clause before the colon)</em></p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The slide shows the most popular car colors in 2018: white, gray, and black.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> I went to the grocery store to pick up some items for dinner, including: chicken, cheese, and onions.<br>
                <em>(never use colons with "including")</em></p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> I went to the grocery store to pick up some items for dinner, including chicken, cheese, and onions.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>TIP – Colons and Clauses</h4>
                <p>A colon can join two independent clauses if the second clause after the colon acts as a definition, an example, an explanation, or a clarification of the first clause. This is an advanced grammar rule that rarely appears on the ACT.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Buddy got what he worked for: he really deserved that promotion.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> My father gave me one rule to live by: honesty is always the best policy.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Dashes</h3>
            <p>Dashes can function like unnecessary information commas, parentheses, or colons.</p>
            
            <h3>Two Dashes (Most Common)</h3>
            <p>Most commonly on the ACT, 2 dashes function like unnecessary information commas or parentheses to separate unnecessary information in the middle of a sentence.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Residents of Washington D.C. – the capital of the United States – are still trying to get representation in Congress.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Glazed donuts – even if they are unhealthy – are my favorite.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Keep an eye out for pairs of dashes setting apart unnecessary information. A pair of dashes sets apart unnecessary information in the same way that a pair of commas does. <strong>It is important to remember that you cannot mix punctuation!</strong> It must be a pair of commas, a pair of dashes, or a pair of parentheses.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Deep-dish pizza – a famous meal in Chicago, does not exist in Italy.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Deep-dish pizza, a famous meal in Chicago, does not exist in Italy.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Deep-dish pizza – a famous meal in Chicago – does not exist in Italy.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Deep-dish pizza (a famous meal in Chicago) does not exist in Italy.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Single Dash Acting Like a Colon</h3>
            <p>On more difficult questions, a single dash can act as a colon introducing a list of multiple items, a list of one item, an example, an explanation, a definition, or a clarification. When acting as a colon, a dash must follow the same 3 colon rules we just covered.</p>

            <h3>Apostrophes</h3>
            <p>Apostrophes on the ACT have two functions: possession and contractions.</p>
            
            <h3>Possession Rules</h3>
            
            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>Apostrophe Rules for Possession:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>For singular nouns:</strong> Add an apostrophe and the letter "s" to the end of the word</li>
                    <li><strong>For singular words ending in "s":</strong> Add either apostrophe + "s" OR just an apostrophe (both are correct)</li>
                    <li><strong>For plural nouns ending in "s":</strong> Add the apostrophe after the "s"</li>
                    <li><strong>For plural nouns not ending in "s":</strong> Add an apostrophe and the letter "s"</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Singular:</strong> Terrence's bike is much faster than my brother's roller blades.</p>

                <h4>TIP – Possessive vs. Plural</h4>
                <p>The ACT asks you to pick between singular possessive, plural possessive, and non-possessive plural words. The challenge is that the words sound very similar:</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> I accidentally stepped on the dog's bone. <em>(singular possessive)</em></p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The dogs' collars are in the basket by the door. <em>(plural possessive)</em></p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> I watched as the dogs played in the yard. <em>(non-possessive plural)</em></p>
                <p>Before adding an apostrophe, make sure the next word is actually being possessed by the noun.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Possessive Pronouns</h3>
            <p>Possessive pronouns (his, hers, its, theirs, ours, yours) end in an "s" and <strong>do not use an apostrophe</strong> to show possession.</p>
            
            <div class="concept-box">

            <h3>Contractions</h3>
            <p>For a contraction, add an apostrophe. For example, "it's" is a contraction for "it is" and "they're" is a contraction for "they are."</p>
            
            <div class="practice-box">
                <h4>Practice with Common Contractions:</h4>
                <p><strong>"its" (possessive) vs. "it's" (it is)</strong></p>
                <p>I cannot believe that (its/it's) not butter! → <strong>it's</strong></p>
                <p>The dog keeps chasing (its/it's) tail. → <strong>its</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>"your" (possessive) vs. "you're" (you are)</strong></p>
                <p>Please keep (your/you're) feelings to yourself. → <strong>your</strong></p>
                <p>(Your/you're) not going to believe what happened! → <strong>You're</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>"their" (possessive) vs. "they're" (they are)</strong></p>
                <p>The gold medal winners held up (their/they're) medals. → <strong>their</strong></p>
                <p>(Their/They're) going to the opera despite the bad reviews. → <strong>They're</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>"whose" (possessive) vs. "who's" (who is)</strong></p>
                <p>I do not know (whose/who's) socks these are. → <strong>whose</strong></p>
                <p>Honestly, (whose/who's) going to pay fifteen dollars for a burrito? → <strong>who's</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>TIP – Possessive Pronouns vs. Contractions</h4>
                <p>If you need to pick between a contraction and a possessive pronoun, plug in the complete phrase and see if it works.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> The cat loves playing with (its/it's) new toy. (plug in "it is")</p>
                <p>The cat loves playing with it is new toy. ← <em>This is wrong!</em></p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The cat loves playing with its new toy.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Quotation Marks</h3>
            <p>Quotation marks are most commonly used for direct quotes.</p>
            
            <h3>Direct Quotes That Are Spoken</h3>
            <p>Direct quotes that are spoken are offset by a comma. Anytime the quote is actually being spoken in some way (said, yelled, whispered, exclaimed, etc.), there is a comma before or after the quotation.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Abigail said, "I will not pay until the painting is completed."</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> "The thunderstorm last night woke me up," Paul whispered.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Direct Quotes That Are Not Spoken</h3>
            <p>Direct quotes that are not spoken have no commas. If the quote is not being spoken and is just a phrase or part of the sentence, there is no punctuation.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> My grandfather described the shells as, "beautiful souvenirs from a past life."</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> My grandfather described the shells as "beautiful souvenirs from a past life."</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Here, the quotation marks show "beautiful souvenirs from a past life" are the grandfather's words and not the writer's words. Since the words are not actually being spoken by the grandfather, there is no comma before the quotation marks.</p>
            
            <h3>Technical Terms and Unusual Usage</h3>
            <p>Quotation marks can be used to show a word is being used as a technical term, used in an unusual or slang way, or used as another expression that varies from standard usage.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Having defined the term "contact variance," Dr. Chen continued his lecture.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Sven refers to himself as a "professional" influencer.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> This "revolutionary" program has left thousands of children without a basic education.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Allie could smell the "fresh" fish from across the room.</p>

                    <li><strong>Identify the type of punctuation being tested</strong> (semicolon, colon, dash, apostrophe, quotation marks)</li>
                    <li><strong>Apply the specific rules for that punctuation mark</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Check if the punctuation correctly joins or separates the parts of the sentence</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>For apostrophes, determine if you need possession or contraction</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>For quotation marks, determine if the quote is spoken or not</strong></li>
                </ol>

            <div class="key-takeaway">
                <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
                <p>Each punctuation mark has specific rules and purposes. Semicolons join independent clauses, colons introduce lists and explanations, dashes set off information or act like colons, apostrophes show possession and contractions, and quotation marks indicate direct quotes. Master these rules and you'll handle punctuation questions with confidence!</p>

        title: 'Chapter 4: Verbs',
        content: `
            <p class="lesson-intro">Verbs questions test you on two major topics – subject-verb agreement and verb tense. The subject-verb agreement questions are trickier, as at times it can be difficult to find the subject and "hear" which verb is correct. You will learn a few methods in this chapter to correctly answer these questions.</p>
            
            <h3>Subject-Verb Agreement</h3>
            <p>Whenever you see a verbs question on the ACT, your first job is to find the subject. The subject, which is the person, place, or thing doing the action, is usually at the beginning of the sentence.</p>
            
            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>Basic Rule:</h4>
                <p>The subject of the sentence must agree with the verb. If the subject is singular, the verb must be singular, and if the subject is plural, the verb must be plural.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>In simple sentences when the subject and verbs are right next to each other, it will be easy to select the right verb:</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p>Cats (loves/love) to sit in empty boxes. → <strong>love</strong></p>
                <p>My dog (barks/bark) at the mailman every day. → <strong>barks</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Easy right? Unfortunately, verbs questions will not be this easy on test day. The ACT increases the difficulty by putting distance between the subject and the verb. The farther away the subject is from the verb, the more likely we are to say the verb incorrectly. <strong>Remember, what sounds right is not always right. You cannot trust your ear on subject-verb agreement questions.</strong></p>
            
            <h3>Three Ways the ACT Tricks You</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>1. Unnecessary Information Phrases Between Subject and Verb</h4>
                <p>Unnecessary information phrases never contain the subject. Cross out any unnecessary information phrases to find the subject.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Tortoises, <strike>known to live to over 150 years old,</strike> (is/are) sold at the local pet shop.</p>
                <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Tortoises (plural) → <strong>are</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>2. Prepositional Phrases Between Subject and Verb (Most Common)</h4>
                <p>Prepositional phrases never contain the subject or the verb. Cross out prepositional phrases to find the subject.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> The entire group <strike>of students</strike> (is/are) organizing a bake sale to raise money.</p>
                <p><strong>Subject:</strong> group (singular) → <strong>is</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> The pod <strike>of dolphins</strike> (hunts/hunt) as a team.</p>
                <p><strong>Subject:</strong> pod (singular) → <strong>hunts</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>3. Group Nouns That Sound Plural But Are Singular</h4>
                <p>Group nouns (class, committee, team, jury, herd, etc.) are singular even though the group consists of more than one person/thing.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> The sheep herd (waits/wait) to be sheared.</p>
                <p><strong>Subject:</strong> herd (singular group noun) → <strong>waits</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> The jury (agrees/agree) that the defendant deserves to be put in jail.</p>
                <p><strong>Subject:</strong> jury (singular group noun) → <strong>agrees</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>TIP – Plug in "he/she/it" for singular subjects and "they" for plural subjects</h4>
                <p>Sometimes it is difficult to "hear" which verb correctly matches with the subject. For singular words, plug in "he," "she," or "it" for the subject. For plural words, plug in "they" for the subject. With this trick, we will be able to easily hear which verb properly agrees with the subject.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> The exact time <strike>for the meeting with the softball coach</strike> and location <strike>for the showcase</strike> (has/have) not been finalized.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Cross out prepositional phrases</p>
                <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Identify subjects: "time" and "location" (plural)</p>
                <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Replace with "they": They (has/have) not been finalized.</p>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> have</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>TIP – Read the Subject and Verb Side-by-Side</h4>
                <p>Once you find the subject and verb, read them next to each other and ignore the information in between. This will help you more easily identify which one is correct.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> A large percentage <strike>of the voters, many of whom are under the age of 30,</strike> (prefer/prefers) the new housing proposal.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Subject:</strong> percentage (singular)</p>
                <p><strong>Side-by-side:</strong> A percentage prefers the new housing proposal.</p>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> prefers</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="practice-box">
                <h4>Practice Examples</h4>

            <h3>Verb Tense</h3>
            <p>For questions on verb tense, trust your ear. As a native English speaker, you will know what sounds right or wrong in the sentence as long as you read for context. To find which tense is correct, read the previous sentence(s) and look for other verbs. Make sure to match the tense in the rest of the paragraph.</p>
            
            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>Key Rule for Verb Tense:</h4>
                <p>On the ACT, do not pick a complicated tense (has run, had ran, had been running, would have run, etc.) when a simple tense works.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p>Last year, Margot (designs/designed/will design) a new line of summer dresses. → <strong>designed</strong></p>
                <p>Before he votes tomorrow, Dale (researches/research/will research) each candidate's positions on the major issues. → <strong>will research</strong></p>
                <p>The referee stopped the fight after the boxers (refuses/refused/will refuse) to follow the rules. → <strong>refused</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Perfect Tense</h3>
            <p>In English, we use the perfect tense when there are multiple timelines in a sentence. The perfect tense is when we say "has" or "have" or "had" with the verb. If you read for context and read the entire sentence, you should be able to "hear" when we need to use the perfect tense.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p>Many surfers enjoy paddling out, but few (rode/have ridden) waves over ten feet tall. → <strong>have ridden</strong></p>
                <p>While the group of entrepreneurs claimed to all be successful, only a few (will start/have started) their own businesses. → <strong>have started</strong></p>
                <p>The bison (ate/had been eating) when the lions began their attack. → <strong>had been eating</strong></p>
                <p>By the beginning of next year, the doctors (finish/finished/will have finished) their preliminary research on lung cancer. → <strong>will have finished</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Conditional Tense</h3>
            <p>The conditional tense describes what would or could happen in the future. The kind of verb conjugation that we need depends on how likely the outcome is to actually happen (probable, improbable, impossible). Again, the key here is to trust your ear and go with what sounds right to you.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p>If I make the free throw, we (will win/would win/would have won) the game. → <strong>will win</strong></p>
                <p>If I made the free throw, we (will win/would win/would have won) the game. → <strong>would win</strong></p>
                <p>If I had made the free throw, we (will win/would win/would have won) the game. → <strong>would have won</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Irregular Verbs</h3>
            <p>The ACT also tests you on irregular verbs. For these verbs, just trust your ear and go with what sounds correct to you.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p>Before the show (began/begun), the lights were dimmed. → <strong>began</strong></p>
                <p>The deliveryman had (rang/rung) the doorbell before dropping off the package. → <strong>rung</strong></p>
                <p>By the time the meal was over, the boy had (ate/eaten) an entire bag of popcorn and had (drank/drunk) a liter of cola. → <strong>eaten, drunk</strong></p>

                <h4>TIP – Irregular Verbs: "a" vs. "u" versions</h4>
                <p>For many of the most difficult irregular verbs, there is an "a" version (ex: swam) and a "u" version (ex: swum). We use these verbs incorrectly all of the time, so using your ear and trying to hear which one sounds correct is difficult. All you need to do is remember the simple rules below:</p>

                    <p><strong>With "has," "have," or "had":</strong> Use the "u" version (perfect tense)</p>
                    <p><strong>With no "has," "have," or "had":</strong> Use the "a" version (past tense)</p>

                <h4>How to Spot Subject-Verb Agreement vs. Verb Tense Questions</h4>
                <p>Spotting verbs questions in general is pretty easy: the answer choices will have different forms of the same verb. Knowing we are dealing with a verbs question is a good start, but to answer the question correctly we need to know if we are being tested on subject-verb agreement or verb tense.</p>
                
                <h4>Subject-Verb Agreement Questions:</h4>
                <p><strong>Verbs in the answer choices have singular and plural versions.</strong> Look for "is" vs. "are," "has" vs. "have," "was" vs. "were," and any other verbs with a singular version vs. a plural version. Anytime you see verbs that have a singular and plural version in the answer choices, the question is testing you on subject-verb agreement.</p>
                
                <h4>Verb Tense Questions:</h4>
                <p><strong>1. Verbs in the answer choices are in different tenses.</strong> For example, if "requires," "required," and "will require" are in the answer choices, the question is testing you on tense.</p>
                <p><strong>2. Verbs in the answer choices do NOT have singular and plural versions.</strong> If there are not options for singular and plural versions, subject-verb agreement is not being tested.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="practice-box">
                <h4>Practice Examples</h4>
                
                <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> <em>The addition of solar panels to the roof of a house in Nevada make the house on average 20% more energy efficient.</em></p>
                <p>A. NO CHANGE &nbsp;&nbsp; B. makes &nbsp;&nbsp; C. have made &nbsp;&nbsp; D. were making</p>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> B (subject-verb agreement - "addition" is singular)</p>
                
                <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> <em>The girl scouts are hosting a bake sale tomorrow to raise money. To get ready, Adya would need to bake two trays of blondies and a box of donut holes.</em></p>
                <p>A. NO CHANGE &nbsp;&nbsp; B. was needing &nbsp;&nbsp; C. needed &nbsp;&nbsp; D. needs</p>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> D (verb tense - present tense matches the context)</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Your Approach for Verbs Questions</h3>
            <p>When you encounter a verbs question:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Determine the type:</strong> Look at answer choices to see if it's subject-verb agreement or verb tense</li>
                <li><strong>For subject-verb agreement:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Find the subject by crossing out prepositional phrases and unnecessary information</li>
                        <li>Determine if the subject is singular or plural</li>
                        <li>Use the "he/she/it" vs. "they" trick if needed</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>For verb tense:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Read for context in surrounding sentences</li>
                        <li>Match the tense to other verbs in the passage</li>
                        <li>Choose the simplest tense that works</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <div class="key-takeaway">
                <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
                <p>Verbs questions test two main concepts: subject-verb agreement and verb tense. For subject-verb agreement, always find the true subject by eliminating distractors. For verb tense, read for context and match the surrounding verbs. Master these approaches and you'll handle verbs questions with confidence!</p>

        content: `
            <p class="lesson-intro">Pronouns are words that stand in for a person, place, or thing. On the ACT, you will need to know how to select the proper pronoun based on case ("he" vs. "him" or "who" vs. "whom"), make sure that a pronoun agrees with the word it is replacing, and spot ambiguous pronouns.</p>
            
            <h3>Pronoun Case</h3>
            <p>Pronouns have two cases: subject and object. The pronoun's role in the sentence (subject or object) dictates which type of pronoun is correct.</p>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Pronoun Cases</h4>
                <table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;">
                    <tr style="border-bottom: 2px solid #ddd;">

                        <td style="padding: 0.5rem; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Object</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">
                        <td style="padding: 0.5rem; font-weight: bold;">Singular</td>
                        <td style="padding: 0.5rem; text-align: center;">I, You, He/She/It, Who</td>

                    </tr>

                        <td style="padding: 0.5rem; font-weight: bold;">Plural</td>
                        <td style="padding: 0.5rem; text-align: center;">We, You, They, Who</td>
                        <td style="padding: 0.5rem; text-align: center;">Us, You, Them, Whom</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </div>
            
            <p>For simple pronoun case questions, it will be easy to tell which pronoun is correct. Just trust your ear!</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p>(They/Them) went to the street festival on Saturday afternoon. → <strong>They</strong></p>
                <p>The man handed (we/us) a stack of flyers. → <strong>us</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Pronouns in Lists</h3>
            <p>One type of more advanced pronouns question occurs when the pronoun is in a list. Since we often say pronouns in a list incorrectly, we may no longer be able to simply "hear" which pronoun is correct. <strong>For a pronoun in a list, ignore the other items in the list and just read the pronoun to tell which is correct.</strong></p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p>The policeman asked to speak to my friends and (me/I).</p>
                <p><strong>Test:</strong> The policeman asked to speak to... me/I.</p>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> me</p>
                
                <p>His girlfriend and (he/him) went to the hockey game.</p>
                <p><strong>Test:</strong> ...he/him went to the hockey game.</p>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> he</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Pronouns in Prepositional Phrases</h3>
            <p>At times, pronouns are also included in a prepositional phrase. <strong>Pronouns in prepositional phrases always are in the object case.</strong> Remember this rule, as it can be difficult to tell which one is correct by just using your ear.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p>The bet between Joe and (I/me) was for just five dollars. → <strong>me</strong></p>
                <p>To (who/whom) was the award given? → <strong>whom</strong></p>
                <p>Jerry claims that a great rivalry exists among Tim, Scott, and (he/him). → <strong>him</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Who vs. Whom</h3>
            <p>You need to know the difference between "who" and "whom," as it is tested on almost every ACT. Technically, "who" is the subject of the sentence, and "whom" is the object. But knowing that is not very helpful. Here's the trick you need to memorize:</p>
            
            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>The Who vs. Whom Trick:</h4>
                <p><strong>If you can replace the word with "he," "she," or "they," use "who."</strong></p>
                <p><strong>If you can replace the word with "him," "her," or "them," use "whom."</strong></p>
                <p><em>You may need to rearrange the sentence a bit, but this trick will work for any who vs. whom question.</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="practice-box">
                <h4>Practice Examples:</h4>
                <p><strong>(Who/Whom) stole the apple off the teacher's desk?</strong></p>
                <p>Test: He/Him stole the apple... → He works!</p>
                <p>Answer: <strong>Who</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>To (who/whom) should I address this letter?</strong></p>
                <p>Rearrange: I should address this letter to him/he → Him works!</p>
                <p>Answer: <strong>whom</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>(Who/Whom) do you want to win the Bachelor?</strong></p>
                <p>Rearrange: You want him/he to win → Him works!</p>
                <p>Answer: <strong>whom</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>TIP - Who vs. Whom in Phrases</h4>
                <p>On more difficult questions, who/whom can also be used to introduce a phrase describing a person. Using our normal "he/him" trick does not work if we look at the entire sentence. However, if we just look at the phrase on its own, the trick still works.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The child (who/whom) I invited to the party was very noisy.</strong></p>
                <p>Look only at the phrase: [who/whom I invited to the party]</p>
                <p>Test: I invited him/he to the party → Him works!</p>
                <p>Answer: <strong>whom</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>Quick trick:</strong> If the word right after "who/whom" is a verb, use "who." If the word right after is a noun, use "whom."</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Reflexive Pronouns</h3>
            <p>Reflexive pronouns, which use the "-self" ending (myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves), can only be used when the pronoun is referring back to a person or thing elsewhere in the sentence or in previous sentences.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> I grabbed three donuts and put them in a box for me.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> I grabbed three donuts and put them in a box for myself.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> I asked my coworker to put three donuts in a box for myself.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> I asked my coworker to put three donuts in a box for me.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Possessive Pronouns</h3>
            <p>At times, pronouns will also be used to show possession. It is important that these pronouns still match with the word(s) that are being replaced.</p>

            <h3>Pronoun Agreement</h3>
            <p>Pronouns must agree with the antecedent, which is the noun that the pronoun is replacing. Whenever you see a pronoun on the ACT, you must find exactly who or what it is referring to. The antecedent can be in the same sentence as the pronoun or in a preceding sentence.</p>
            
            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>Pronoun Agreement Rules:</h4>
                <p><strong>Pronouns must match the antecedent in terms of plurality and gender.</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A singular antecedent must have a singular pronoun</li>
                    <li>A plural antecedent must have a plural pronoun</li>
                    <li>A male antecedent must have a male pronoun</li>
                    <li>A female antecedent must have a female pronoun</li>

            <h3>Ambiguous Pronouns</h3>
            <p>For a pronoun to be correct, we must know exactly who or what it is referring to. If we do not know exactly who or what a pronoun is referring to, the pronoun is ambiguous and is always incorrect.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Stephen smiled at his father as he threw the ball.</p>
                <p><em>We do not know if "he" is referring to Stephen or his father, so "he" is ambiguous and incorrect.</em></p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Stephen smiled at his father as his father threw the ball.</p>

                <h4>Spotting Ambiguous Pronouns Questions</h4>
                <p>Anytime you see a pronoun in the answer choices, check to see if the pronoun is ambiguous. Here are all of the pronouns you should keep an eye out for: <strong>he, him, his, she, her, hers, they, them, their, it, its, this, that, these, those, some, none.</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="practice-box">
                <h4>Practice Example:</h4>
                <p><strong>Of the 2020 inductees to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, which include Biggie Smalls, Nine Inch Nails and its lead singer Trent Reznor, and the Doobie Brothers, it is widely agreed that he is the most famous.</strong></p>
                
                <p>A. NO CHANGE &nbsp;&nbsp; B. they are &nbsp;&nbsp; C. Biggie is &nbsp;&nbsp; D. it is</p>
                
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> C - We need to specify who is the most famous. "He," "they," or "it" could be referring to multiple people or things, so answer choices A, B, and D are all ambiguous. The only answer choice that is specific is C.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-takeaway">
                <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
                <p>Pronoun questions test three main areas: case (subject vs. object), agreement (matching the antecedent), and clarity (avoiding ambiguity). Always identify what the pronoun refers to, ensure it matches in number and gender, and choose the correct case based on the pronoun's role in the sentence. When in doubt, use the substitution tricks to hear what sounds right!</p>

        title: 'Chapter 6: Misplaced Modifiers',
        content: `
            <p class="lesson-intro">A misplaced modifier is a word, phrase, or clause that is improperly separated from the noun that it modifies. A misplaced modifier leads to a sentence that has an incorrect or unintended meaning. Misplaced modifiers are hard to spot because we usually know what the sentence is really supposed to be saying.</p>
            
            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>The "Next-Door Neighbor" Rule</h4>
                <p>For a modifier to be properly placed, it must be right "next-door" to the noun it is describing. Modifiers can be at the beginning, middle, or end of a sentence.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>If the modifier is at the beginning of the sentence,</strong> the first noun after must be the word being modified.</li>
                    <li><strong>If the modifier is in the middle or end of the sentence,</strong> it must be modifying the noun directly before it.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><em>The modifier "consistently erupting" is supposed to be modifying the Old Faithful geyser, but instead it is modifying Jack! Let's hope Jack is not consistently erupting.</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Consistently erupting, the Old Faithful geyser at Yellowstone National Park is one of Jack's favorite things to take pictures of.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Since it is consistently erupting, Jack loves taking pictures of the Old Faithful geyser at Yellowstone National Park.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Front of the Sentence Modifiers with a Comma</h3>
            <p>On the ACT, most misplaced modifiers questions have a modifier at the front of the sentence separated by a comma. For this type of question, consider who or what the modifier is describing and then make sure that person, place, or thing is the first noun in the rest of the sentence.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Not popular since the early 1980s, the documentary about mullets explored the origins of the wildly popular hairstyle.</p>
                <p><em>The modifier is "not popular since the early 1980s," so the next noun must be whoever or whatever the modifier is describing. In the incorrect version, the next noun "documentaries" is not what we are supposed to be describing.</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Not popular since the early 1980s, mullets were the topic of a recently released documentary.</p>
                <p><em>The correct version puts the described word "mullets" right next-door to the modifier at the beginning of the sentence.</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="practice-box">
                <h4>Practice Example:</h4>
                <p><strong>Addressing the group of reporters gathered outside of the police station, there was no indication that the police chief knew if the suspect was in custody or not.</strong></p>
                
                <p>A. NO CHANGE</p>
                <p>B. the police chief said he did not know if the suspect was in custody or not.</p>
                <p>C. no indication of whether or not the suspect was in custody was given by the police chief.</p>
                <p>D. the police chief's report gave no indication of whether the suspect was in custody or not.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> B - Who is "addressing the group of reporters"? The police chief! So "the police chief" must come right after the comma.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Middle or End of Sentence Modifiers with Commas</h3>
            <p>A modifier in the middle or at the end of the sentence must be directly after whoever or whatever it is modifying.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> The research team, which arrived at their nesting grounds early this year, tracked the movements of the blue storks.</p>
                <p><em>The modifier "which arrived at their nesting grounds early this year" was incorrectly modifying the research team. However, this modifier should be modifying the blue storks.</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The research team tracked the movements of the blue storks, which arrived at their nesting grounds early this year.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The research team, which tracked the movement of the blue storks, noted that the birds arrived at their nesting grounds early.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Modifiers without Commas</h3>
            <p>In some questions, the modifier will not be separated by any commas. These are harder to spot, but the "next-door neighbor" rule still applies. Keep an eye out for phrases starting with "that" or words ending in "-ing" and "-ed."</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> A tarantula bit one of my coworkers that had a huge, hairy body.</p>
                <p><em>The incorrect sentence has the modifier "that had a huge, hairy body" describing the coworker and not the tarantula.</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> A tarantula that had a huge, hairy body bit one of my coworkers.</p>
                <p><em>By moving the modifier right next to the tarantula in the correct sentence, we are describing the tarantula as having a huge, hairy body.</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="practice-box">
                <h4>Practice Example:</h4>

                <p>A. NO CHANGE</p>
                <p>B. celebrating the deal talked on the balcony smoking cigars.</p>
                <p>C. smoking cigars talked to celebrate the deal on the balcony.</p>
                <p>D. smoking cigars to celebrate the deal talked on the balcony.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> D - The businessmen are smoking cigars to celebrate the deal, so "smoking cigars to celebrate the deal" should come right before "talked."</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Prepositional Phrases as Modifiers</h3>
            <p>Prepositional phrases can also act as modifiers and must be placed in the correct position to have the intended meaning. These occur less commonly on the ACT and are often difficult to spot.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Paul and his father talked about the baseball game in the stands.</p>
                <p><em>In the first sentence, the baseball game is in the stands. We know that's not the case.</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> In the stands, Paul and his father talked about the baseball game.</p>
                <p><em>Now, the phrase is describing Paul and his father as being in the stands.</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Modifiers in Parentheses</h3>
            <p>Modifiers that are set apart in parentheses must be placed directly "next-door" to whoever or whatever they are modifying. Phrases in parentheses will always be in the middle or end of the sentence, so the word being described must be right before the parentheses. This type of misplaced modifier is very rarely tested on the ACT.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> The scientists tried to develop a new method to make their self-pollination study (where pollen from the same plant arrives at the stigma of the flower) completely free of pollen contamination from other plants.</p>
                <p><em>The modifier in the parentheses is defining what self-pollination is, but "study" is directly before the parentheses.</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The scientists tried to develop a new method to study self-pollination (where pollen from the same plant arrives at the stigma of the flower) completely free of pollen contamination from other plants.</p>
                <p><em>Now self-pollination is directly before the parentheses.</em></p>

                <h4>How to Spot Misplaced Modifiers Questions</h4>
                <p>The hardest part about misplaced modifiers questions is spotting them! Most students think these questions are about phrasing or flow and never realize what they are actually being tested on.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Misplaced modifiers questions always have at least one and, very often, both of the following defining characteristics:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>All 4 answer choices are similar in length, and the answer choices have the same words scrambled in different orders.</strong> Anytime you see 4 long answer choices that are all saying the same general thing in different orders, you are very likely looking at a misplaced modifiers question.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>The first word varies in the answer choices.</strong> If the first word or group of words is different in 3 or 4 of the answer choices, the question is most likely testing you on misplaced modifiers.</li>
                </ol>

            <div class="practice-box">

                <p>B. fish were found to communicate using UV coloration and signaling.</p>
                <p>C. it was discovered by scientists that fish communicate using UV coloration and signaling.</p>
                <p>D. UV coloration and signaling were discovered as a way fish communicate.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A - Who or what is "analyzing the ultraviolet camera footage"? The scientists! Since "the scientists" must be right next-door, the answer is A.</p>

            <h3>Your Approach for Misplaced Modifiers Questions</h3>
            <p>Whenever you spot a misplaced modifiers question, follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Identify the modifier</strong> - What word, phrase, or clause is describing something?</li>
                <li><strong>Ask yourself: "Who or what is the modifier describing?"</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Make sure the modifier is placed right "next-door" to what it's describing</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Check that the sentence makes logical sense</strong></li>

                <h4>Final Practice Examples:</h4>
                
                <p><strong>1. Eric's foot indicated his nervousness during the interview, which jiggled wildly.</strong></p>
                <p>A. NO CHANGE &nbsp;&nbsp; B. Eric's foot indicated his nervousness during the interview, jiggling wildly. &nbsp;&nbsp; C. Eric's foot, which jiggled wildly, indicated his nervousness during the interview. &nbsp;&nbsp; D. Jiggling wildly during the interview, Eric showed his nervousness.</p>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> C - Eric's foot (not the interview) jiggled wildly.</p>

                <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
                <p>Misplaced modifiers are all about placement - modifiers must be right "next-door" to what they're describing. When you see answer choices with the same words in different orders, look for the misplaced modifier and make sure it's properly positioned. Remember: the modifier should clearly and logically describe the intended noun without creating confusion or unintended meanings!</p>

        title: 'Chapter 7: Parallel Structure',
        content: `
            <p class="lesson-intro">Parallel structure is the repetition of a chosen grammatical form within a sentence as items are listed or compared. The items in a list can be words, phrases, or clauses. Whenever we see items in a list or a comparison between items, we must make sure the items have parallel structure.</p>
            
            <h3>Parallel Structure and Lists</h3>
            <p>The items in any list must be written with the same grammatical form. Items must be all nouns, all verbs, and so on. When lists are written with proper parallel structure, the sentence flows more smoothly and sounds better. As a result, many students can "hear" which answer choice is correct without even realizing they are being tested on parallel structure.</p>

            <p>No matter how simple or complex the items in the list are, they must be parallel. Lists of 3 or more items are easier to spot, and you will be able to more obviously "hear" which answer choice is correct or incorrect. <strong>Lists of 2, however, are more difficult to spot and can often sound good to us even if they are not parallel.</strong> Be aware of parallel structure anytime you see a list of 2 on the ACT, as this is a topic that tricks many students when it appears on test day.</p>

                <h4>How to Spot Parallel Structure and Lists Questions</h4>
                <p>Parallel structure and lists questions always have the following defining characteristic:</p>
                <p><strong>The sentence includes a list of two or more items.</strong> Anytime there is a list, we will need to consider parallel structure. Keep an eye out for lists of two, as these can be difficult to notice errors with parallel structure.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="practice-box">
                <h4>Practice Example:</h4>
                <p><strong>The responsibilities of the coffee packer position included packing the coffee beans, which have been roasted, and keeping the work area around the machine clean and orderly.</strong></p>
                
                <p>A. NO CHANGE &nbsp;&nbsp; B. to keep &nbsp;&nbsp; C. kept &nbsp;&nbsp; D. having kept</p>
                
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A - The list of two responsibilities, "packing the beans" and "keeping the work area around the machine clean and orderly" must be parallel. "Packing" and "keeping" match and have correct parallel structure.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Special Cases for Parallel Structure</h3>
            <p>In addition to lists, there are also certain other special cases for parallel structure. These special cases, which are officially called correlative conjunctions, must have the same grammatical structure for both parts of the conjunctions.</p>
            
            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>Keep an eye out for these on the ACT:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Neither ____ nor ____</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Either ____ or ____</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Not only ____ but also ____</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Both ____ and ____</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>In all of these special cases, the "blanks" must be parallel.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> My mother not only took away my keys but also she locked them in the safe.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> My mother not only took away my keys but also locked them in the safe.</p>
                <p><em>In the incorrect example, "took away my keys" is not parallel with "she locked them in the safe." Since the "she" is not in the first part, it cannot be in the second part.</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Parallel Structure and Comparisons</h3>
            <p>For any comparisons, the items being compared must be parallel. Comparing without proper parallel structure can lead to unintended or incorrect comparisons. In other words, make sure you are comparing apples to apples and not apples to oranges. A common fix to parallel structure mistakes is to add "those of" or "that of" or other similar variations before the second item in the comparison.</p>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>How to Spot Parallel Structure and Comparisons Questions</h4>
                <p>Parallel structure and comparison questions always have at least one of the following defining characteristics:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>A commonly used comparison word</strong> such as "more," "less," "better," "worse," and "than" is in the answer choices or in the sentence.</li>
                    <li><strong>The phrase "that of" or "those of"</strong> or a similar variation ("that in," "those at," etc.) is in any of the answer choices.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> The fried chicken at Chick-fil-A is much better than Popeyes.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The fried chicken at Chick-fil-A is better than the fried chicken at Popeyes.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The fried chicken at Chick-fil-A is better than Popeyes' fried chicken.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The fried chicken at Chick-fil-A is better than that at Popeyes.</p>

            <div class="practice-box">
                <h4>Practice Example:</h4>
                <p><strong>Victoria concluded that the juiciness of fuji apples is a better indicator for the flavor than for a bosc pear.</strong></p>
                
                <p>A. NO CHANGE &nbsp;&nbsp; B. than of bosc pears. &nbsp;&nbsp; C. than for that of bosc pears. &nbsp;&nbsp; D. then bosc pears.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> C - We must compare "the juiciness of fuji apples" to "the juiciness of bosc pears." We must compare the juiciness of the fuji apple to the juiciness of the bosc pears and not to the pear itself. The only answer that does this is C, where "that of bosc pears" is short for "the juiciness of bosc pears."</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-takeaway">
                <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
                <p>Parallel structure ensures that lists and comparisons use consistent grammatical forms. Watch for lists (especially lists of two items), correlative conjunctions (either/or, not only/but also), and comparisons with "than." When items aren't parallel, the sentence will often sound awkward or unclear. Make sure you're comparing apples to apples!</p>

        title: 'Chapter 8: Other Miscellaneous Topics',
        content: `
            <p class="lesson-intro">There are a variety of other miscellaneous topics that appear on the English Test. We will cover all of these topics in this chapter.</p>
            
            <h3>Commonly Confused Words</h3>
            <p>The ACT will test you on many commonly confused words. The most common one of these on the English Test is "affect" vs. "effect."</p>
            
            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>Affect vs. Effect</h4>
                <p><strong>"Affect" is a verb,</strong> meaning to act on or produce a change in.</p>
                <p><strong>"Effect" is a noun,</strong> meaning the result of a change.</p>
                <p>As long as you remember this rule, "affect" vs. "effect" questions should be easy!</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Sunshine and palm trees affect my mood positively.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Sunshine and palm trees have a positive effect on my mood.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Than vs. Then</h3>
            <p><strong>"Than" is only used for comparisons.</strong> "Then" has multiple meanings: it can be used when dealing with time, to mean "in addition to," or with "if/then" statements. When you see "then" and "than" on the test, just remember this quick rule: <strong>for a comparison, use "than." Otherwise, use "then."</strong></p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> I think that chocolate with almonds is much better then ice cream.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> I think that chocolate with almonds is much better than ice cream.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> I need to call my mother, and than we can leave.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> I need to call my mother, and then we can leave.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Have vs. Of</h3>
            <p>Many people often mistakenly use "could of" or "would of." <strong>This is always incorrect!</strong> To be correct, we need to use "could have" or "would have." The words "could," "should," "would," and "might" should always be followed by "have" not "of".</p>
            
            <p>The reason we often make this mistake is the contraction "could've," which is short for "could have," is often pronounced like "could of."</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> If we left the show earlier, we could of avoided the traffic in the parking lot.</p>

            </div>
            
            <h3>Countable vs. Non-countable Adjectives</h3>
            <p>A countable noun is something that you can count, such as bottles of milk or hours. A non-countable noun is something that cannot be expressed in a plural form, such as time or air. Certain adjectives can only be used to modify countable or non-countable nouns.</p>

            <h3>Active Voice vs. Passive Voice</h3>
            <p>Active voice means that the subject of the sentence is performing the verb's action. On the other hand, passive voice means that the subject is acted on by the verb. <strong>On the ACT, never select an answer choice that is in passive voice; active voice is always better than passive voice.</strong></p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Active Voice:</strong> I picked up the pencil.</p>
                <p><strong>Passive Voice:</strong> The pencil was picked up by me.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Active Voice:</strong> The police chief announced the list of suspects.</p>

            </div>
            
            <h3>Prepositional Idioms</h3>
            <p>In the English language, idioms are expressions that are stated in a certain way because it is a widely accepted practice. Certain words must be paired with certain prepositions to be correct.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Bobby was afraid by the dark.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Bobby was afraid of the dark.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>These questions do not come up often on the ACT, and you should not study this topic unless you have mastered all other chapters in this course. When prepositional idioms do appear on the ACT, read the entire sentence and rely on what sounds best to you.</p>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Common Prepositional Idioms (For Reference Only)</h4>
                <p><strong>Common patterns include:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Afraid of, curious about, different from</strong></li>

                    <li><strong>Based on, focus on, depend on</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Accuse of, consist of, capable of</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>You should not try to memorize this entire list! It is not the best use of your study time. If you do struggle on these, study common patterns and hopefully it will help you better know what sounds best.</em></p>

                <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
                <p>These miscellaneous topics appear less frequently but are still important to know. Focus first on affect/effect, than/then, and have/of as these are most common. For prepositional idioms and other confused words, trust your ear and go with what sounds most natural. Don't spend too much time memorizing every possible combination - focus on the patterns that appear most often on the ACT.</p>

                <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
                <p>Grammar questions on the ACT test a finite set of rules. Master the concepts in chapters 1-8, learn to quickly identify question types, and practice applying the rules systematically. Remember that grammar questions always have one definitively correct answer based on standard English conventions - trust the rules over what "sounds right."</p>

    'redundancy': {
        title: 'Chapter 10: Redundancy, Wordiness, and Irrelevance',
        content: `
            <p class="lesson-intro">On the English Test, wordiness, redundancy, and irrelevance are common errors. Anytime we see redundancy, wordiness, or irrelevant information in an answer choice, it is always incorrect; the shortest and simplest answer choice is almost always correct. The goal is for the sentence to express the same information in the shortest grammatically correct way.</p>
            
            <h3>Redundancy</h3>
            <p>The most common mistake on these types of questions is redundancy. To check for redundancy, read the sentence itself and the sentence(s) before to check for any repeated information.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> After two years of traveling, Jerome finally returned back home.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> After two years of traveling, Jerome finally returned home.</p>
                <p><em>By definition, if Jerome is returning, he is coming back. Therefore, we do not need the word "back" in the sentence.</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> In Sweden, there are about 300,000 to 400,000 moose, many of which stand over seven feet tall, roaming freely in the Swedish forests.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> In Sweden, there are about 300,000 to 400,000 moose, many of which stand over 7 feet tall, roaming freely in the forests.</p>
                <p><em>The sentence already specifies the moose are in Sweden, so saying "Swedish" is redundant.</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Wordiness</h3>
            <p>Sentences can also be unnecessarily wordy without redundancy. For these questions, pick the answer choice that uses the fewest words to express the same idea.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> The ancient Italian sculptures were donated to a cultural institution supporting intellectual endeavors related to renaissance art.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The ancient Italian sculptures were donated to a museum devoted to renaissance art.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Irrelevance</h3>
            <p>Incorrect answer choices may include information that is irrelevant to what is being discussed in the passage. Irrelevant information most often appears as a long and wordy answer choice and is always incorrect.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> To win the game, Ricky needed to make both free throws. Players are not allowed to step in the lane during a free throw attempt. He made the first one. The entire gym was quiet as he stepped to the line for the second.</p>
                <p><strong>Correct:</strong> To win the game, Ricky needed to make both free throws. He made the first one. The entire gym was quiet as he stepped to the line for the second.</p>
                <p><em>The information about players not being allowed to step in the lane is irrelevant to the story about Ricky's free throws.</em></p>

                <h4>How to Spot Redundancy, Wordiness, and Irrelevance Questions</h4>
                <p>The ACT now directly tells you if a question is testing you on redundancy, wordiness, or irrelevance. These questions will ask you one of the following questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>"Which choice is the least redundant in context?"</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>"Which choice best avoids wordiness and redundancy in context?"</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>Your Approach for Redundancy Questions:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Read the entire sentence and surrounding context</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Look for repeated information</strong> - same idea expressed twice</li>
                    <li><strong>Eliminate unnecessarily wordy phrases</strong> - choose concise expressions</li>
                    <li><strong>Remove irrelevant details</strong> - stick to information that supports the main point</li>
                    <li><strong>Choose the shortest grammatically correct answer</strong></li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-takeaway">
                <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
                <p>For redundancy questions, always choose the shortest, clearest option that maintains the sentence's meaning. If information is repeated, irrelevant, or unnecessarily wordy, eliminate it. The ACT values concise, precise writing.</p>

            <p class="lesson-intro">Word choice questions on the ACT ask you to select which word is correct. For these questions, read the sentence and sentence(s) before and after for context to tell which word is correct.</p>
            
            <h3>Understanding Word Choice Questions</h3>
            <p>Some word choice questions may test your knowledge of the definitions of words as well. If a question is testing your vocabulary, do not assume the hardest vocabulary word is correct. Sometimes, the ACT puts challenging words on the test that you need to know and other times the challenging words are incorrect answers.</p>
            
            <p>On test day, do the best you can with the words that you know. If you know that a word works, pick that word no matter how easy or hard the word seems. If you do not know a word and have to guess, take your best guess and move on.</p>
            
            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>How to Identify Word Choice Questions:</h4>
                <p>Word choice questions will always have 4 words with no punctuation or the same punctuation and will ask you, <strong>"Which choice is clearest and most precise in context?"</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="practice-box">

                <p><strong>Adding solar panels to your house can emit huge savings on energy bills each month.</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>Which choice is the clearest and most precise in context?</strong></p>
                <p>A. NO CHANGE &nbsp;&nbsp; B. claim &nbsp;&nbsp; C. gift &nbsp;&nbsp; D. result in</p>
                
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> D - The best way to answer these questions is to read for context, plug each word into the sentence, and pick the one that makes the most sense in the context. Here, "result in" is the only answer choice that works in the context of the sentence.</p>

            <div class="rules-box">

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Ignore the transition currently in the passage.</strong> Cover up the transition word and read the sentence(s) before and after without the transition.</li>
                    <li><strong>Determine the relationship between the sentences.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Look at the answer choices and select the transition that correctly relates the ideas.</strong> Some questions have an option with no transition. If no transition is necessary, select the option with no transition.</li>

            <h3>Two Types of Transitions Questions</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Type 1: All 4 Answer Choices Are Transitions</h4>
                <p>If all 4 answer choices are a transition, you are only being tested on selecting the correct transition.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> <em>From a distance, the ocean looked pretty calm today even though a storm had arrived last night. Under the circumstances, the scene was much more chaotic with big waves and strong riptides.</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Which transition word is the most logical in context?</strong></p>
                <p>A. NO CHANGE &nbsp;&nbsp; B. For instance, &nbsp;&nbsp; C. Up close, &nbsp;&nbsp; D. For example,</p>
                
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> C - Since the previous sentence started with "from a distance," we need to transition to the second sentence of "up close."</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Type 2: 3 Transitions + 1 No Transition Option</h4>
                <p>If we see a question like this, the ACT is asking us to consider which transition is correct and whether a transition is even necessary. Most often, the correct answer is the one that takes away the transition entirely.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> <em>Stepping out on the island's port on Monday, the new couple debuted their own classic take on beach attire. As a result, the actor opted for a classic white tee and board shorts while his model counterpart wore a floral print coverup and strappy sandals.</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Which transition word, if any, is the most logical in context?</strong></p>
                <p>A. NO CHANGE &nbsp;&nbsp; B. In other words, the &nbsp;&nbsp; C. Consequently, the &nbsp;&nbsp; D. The</p>
                
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> D - There is no transition necessary, so the correct answer removes the transition entirely.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Categories of Transitions</h3>
            <p>Below are the most common transitions organized by their function:</p>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Additive Transitions (Adding Information):</h4>
                <p><strong>additionally, again, also, as well, besides, further, furthermore, in addition, indeed, in fact, moreover, of course, then, what is more</strong></p>

                <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
                <p>Transitions questions test your understanding of logical relationships between sentences. Always read for context to determine whether you need to show contrast, similarity, cause-and-effect, examples, or time sequence. Sometimes no transition is needed at all - don't force a connection where none exists naturally.</p>

        content: `
            <p class="lesson-intro">"Which choice" questions ask you to make changes to a sentence or portions of a sentence. The changes that should be made will be detailed in the question itself. These questions are very easy to spot: the question will always have the words "which choice" (more common) or "which one" (less common) in the question.</p>
            
            <h3>Understanding Which Choice Questions</h3>
            
            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>Your Approach:</h4>
                <p>For "which choice" questions, your job is to figure out exactly what the question is asking you to do and select the answer choice that does that. <strong>Do not worry about grammar, conciseness, or style,</strong> as these are never tested on these questions unless the question specifically asks about grammar, conciseness, or style. For "which choice" questions, <strong>shorter is NOT always better.</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Type 1: Specific Changes to Content</h3>
            <p>The first type of "which choice" question asks you to make a specific change to the sentence. For these questions, focus on the sentence you are being asked to edit. You should still read the sentences before and after the underlined portion, but you often will not need to rely too much on the context.</p>
            
            <div class="practice-box">
                <h4>Practice Example:</h4>
                <p><strong>The first home refrigerators were patented in the 1920s. Before their invention, Americans kept their food cold in iceboxes, which required ice to be bought and placed into the box each week.</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>Which choice most specifically describes what was used to build iceboxes?</strong></p>
                <p>A. NO CHANGE</p>
                <p>B. which were only cold enough to keep food cool but not freeze anything.</p>
                <p>C. wooden boxes with tin and insulated with cork and sawdust.</p>
                <p>D. the very first invention that allowed people to keep food cold in their houses.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> C - Notice that all of the answer choices are grammatically correct. Your job here is to pick the answer that "most specifically describes what was used to build iceboxes." Therefore, the answer must be C since it is the only answer choice that has any information about the materials used to build iceboxes.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>TIP – Don't Overthink It. Just Answer the Question!</h4>
                <p>For "which choice" questions, just answer the question that the ACT is asking. It's that simple! We cannot stress this enough. As long as you approach these questions correctly, they should be easy.</p>
                <p>This is particularly important for the questions about specific details. For example, if the question asks, "which answer choice best highlights the colors of autumn," pick the answer choice that has colors in it. For the majority of the "which choice" questions, it's really that easy!</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Type 2: Context-Based Selections</h3>
            <p>The second type of "which choice" question asks you to select the correct sentence based on the context in the passage. Most commonly, you need to select the correct introduction, conclusion, or transition. For these questions, you will need to read for context.</p>
            
            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>Reading for Context:</h4>
                <p>In general, it is good practice to read the 2 sentences before and the 2 sentences after, but you may need to read more than that for certain questions. When first reading for context, ignore the underlined portion.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Focus on where the question is directing you to read.</strong> If the question asks, "which choice best introduces the paragraph," you need to read the entire paragraph before selecting your answer. The most common mistake students make is answering the question before reading the entire paragraph.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="practice-box">
                <h4>Practice Example:</h4>
                <p><strong>Recently, many businesses have been adding color to the workplace to boost employee morale and creativeness. Blue and green help employees feel calm and hopeful, red stimulates employees to be more creative, and yellow inspires good memories. Selecting the right colors can help maximize the profits for shareholders.</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>Given that all the choices are accurate, which choice provides the best conclusion to the paragraph?</strong></p>
                <p>A. NO CHANGE</p>
                <p>B. Painting the walls or putting up artwork can both successfully bring color to the office.</p>
                <p>C. Orange can help increase employee's enthusiasm.</p>
                <p>D. It may seem simple but selecting the right colors can really brighten the office.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> D - This example requires you to think about the paragraph as a whole. The first two sentences of the paragraph focus on the relationship between colors and the workplace. In order to properly conclude the paragraph, the answer choice must summarize the discussion about colors and the workplace. The correct answer D is the only one that properly concludes the paragraph.</p>

            <h3>Common Question Types</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Typical "Which Choice" Questions Ask For:</h4>

                    <li><strong>Relevant examples:</strong> "Which choice provides the most relevant examples..."</li>
                    <li><strong>Effective introductions:</strong> "Which choice best introduces..."</li>
                    <li><strong>Proper conclusions:</strong> "Which choice best concludes..."</li>
                    <li><strong>Appropriate transitions:</strong> "Which choice provides the best transition..."</li>

                <p><strong>Which choice most specifically describes what Adam would like to do in Iceland?</strong></p>
                <p>A. NO CHANGE &nbsp;&nbsp; B. to explore a new country. &nbsp;&nbsp; C. to photograph the glaciers, mountains, and waterfalls. &nbsp;&nbsp; D. to head off to the airport and start his adventure.</p>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> C - This is the most specific about what Adam wants to do in Iceland.</p>

                <p><strong>Which choice most clearly emphasizes how quickly the car stopped?</strong></p>
                <p>A. NO CHANGE &nbsp;&nbsp; B. stopped completely &nbsp;&nbsp; C. swerved around the ducklings &nbsp;&nbsp; D. screeched to a halt</p>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> D - "Screeched to a halt" most clearly emphasizes the quickness of stopping.</p>

                <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
                <p>Which choice questions are straightforward once you understand what they're asking. Read the question carefully, understand exactly what quality or function is needed, and select the answer that best fulfills that specific requirement. Don't overthink it - just answer exactly what's being asked!</p>

            <p class="lesson-intro">Adding or deleting information questions ask you to consider whether information should be included in the passage or not. For these questions, you must read for context. We recommend reading the entire paragraph in which the question is located. Depending on the question, you may need to read more than that, so use your best judgment.</p>

            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>Key Strategy:</h4>
                <p>To best answer these questions, read the paragraph twice: once with the information included and once with the information deleted. Reading the paragraph both with and without the information in the question should make it clear whether the information should be included or deleted.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Type 1: Should Information Be Added?</h4>
                <p>The first type of adding information question gives you a sentence or portion of a sentence and asks you if the information should or should not be added. The answer choices will always have two parts:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Should the information be added:</strong> "yes" or "no"</li>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>Important Note on Justifications:</h4>
                <p>When looking at the second part of the answer choices, make sure that you are only considering the sentence or portion of a sentence that is or is not being added. Many students pick a justification that goes far beyond what the sentence or portion of the sentence says or include details that have nothing to do with the sentence itself.</p>

            <div class="practice-box">
                <h4>Practice Example:</h4>
                <p><strong>Dr. Paul's career began in 1965 when he enrolled at Georgetown's Medical School. He graduated at the top of his class and got hired as a surgeon at the Houston Medical Center. He decided to specialize in heart surgery, quickly becoming known as one of the top young surgeons in Texas.</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>Prior to accepting his promotion to head heart surgeon, Dr. Paul had spent the last eight years training under Dr. Noah Anderson, one of the best cardiologists in the U.S. During what could be best summarized as an apprenticeship, Dr. Paul assisted in over 1,800 assorted cardiac surgeries, perfecting his ability to conduct open-heart surgery.</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>At this point, the writer is considering adding the following true statement:</strong></p>
                <p><em>As a young man, Noah Anderson attended Yale University, where he played baseball and studied biology, and then enrolled at Stanford's Medical School.</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Should the writer make this addition here?</strong></p>
                <p>A. Yes, because it establishes the qualifications of Dr. Paul's mentor.</p>
                <p>B. Yes, because it indicates that Dr. Noah Anderson had a top-notch education.</p>
                <p>C. No, because it does not also indicate where Dr. Paul studied.</p>
                <p>D. No, because the information is not relevant to the passage's discussion of Dr. Paul's career.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> D - The sentence is not relevant to the passage's focus, which is on Dr. Paul's career.</p>

                <p><strong>The writer is considering deleting the underlined portion. Should the underlined portion be kept or deleted?</strong></p>
                <p>A. Kept, because it highlights how dangerous mountain biking is.</p>
                <p>B. Kept, because it details where Jerry and Eric go for the extreme downhill mountain biking.</p>
                <p>C. Deleted, because it is not important where Jerry and Eric go mountain biking.</p>
                <p>D. Deleted, because it distracts from the main point of the paragraph.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> B - The phrase "the tops of the mountains in central California" provides a relevant detail about where the "extreme downhill mountain biking" takes place and also helps explain why it is called "extreme downhill mountain biking."</p>

                <p><strong>For the sake of logic and coherence, Sentence 7 should be placed:</strong></p>
                <p>A. where it is now</p>
                <p>B. after sentence 2</p>
                <p>C. after sentence 4</p>
                <p>D. after sentence 5</p>
                
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> D - Sentence 7 describes the taste and texture of Swiss chocolate, so it should come right after sentence 5, which explains why Swiss chocolate tastes better. This creates a logical flow from explanation to sensory description.</p>

                <h4>Logical Connections to Consider:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chronological order:</strong> Events should follow a time sequence</li>
                    <li><strong>Cause and effect:</strong> Causes should come before effects</li>
                    <li><strong>General to specific:</strong> Broad statements should come before specific examples</li>
                    <li><strong>Topic coherence:</strong> Related ideas should be grouped together</li>
                    <li><strong>Transitional flow:</strong> Sentences should connect smoothly with appropriate transitions</li>
                    <li><strong>Introduction and conclusion:</strong> Opening and closing sentences should be in appropriate positions</li>

                <h4>More Practice Examples:</h4>
                
                <p><strong>[1] Airline travel has improved so much over the last twenty years. [2] Before the mid 1990s, there was absolutely no in-flight entertainment for passengers. [3] Seats had no screens in the back of each headrest with on-demand movies, music, and games. [4] There were not even those old, clunky TVs that folded down from the ceiling every few rows and played just one movie for the entire plane. [5] Even portable music devices, like the iPod or Walkman, had not been invented yet. [6] All passengers could do was read or sleep. [7] Now, I actually look forward to catching up on the movies that I missed on long flights. [8] It sure makes the time go by much more quickly while flying.</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>For the sake of logic and coherence, Sentence 6 should be placed:</strong></p>
                <p>A. where it is now</p>
                <p>B. after sentence 2</p>
                <p>C. before sentence 4</p>
                <p>D. after sentence 7</p>
                
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A - Sentence 6 ("All passengers could do was read or sleep") logically concludes the discussion of what wasn't available in the past, before transitioning to the present situation in sentence 7.</p>

            <div class="practice-box">
                <h4>Final Practice Example:</h4>
                
                <p><strong>[1] Cancer occurs when cells undergo a DNA mutation and begin to replicate uncontrollably. [2] Most mutations are "silent" mutations that have no tangible effects. [3] These cancerous cells begin to divide uncontrollably and form dangerous tumors. [4] What most people do not know is that mutations occur in our cells all the time. [5] Only mutations to specific parts of certain genes, like the p-53 gene, can lead to cells becoming cancerous. [6] As a result, most cancer research to date has focused on p-53 and other similar genes.</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>For the sake of logic and coherence, Sentence 2 should be placed:</strong></p>
                <p>A. where it is now</p>
                <p>B. before sentence 1</p>
                <p>C. after sentence 4</p>
                <p>D. before sentence 6</p>
                
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> C - Sentence 2 explains that most mutations are harmless, which logically follows sentence 4's statement that mutations occur all the time. This creates a better flow: mutations happen all the time → most are harmless → only specific ones cause cancer.</p>

                <h4>Common Mistakes to Avoid:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Not reading the full context:</strong> Always read the entire paragraph, not just around the sentence</li>
                    <li><strong>Ignoring chronology:</strong> Make sure events are in logical time order</li>
                    <li><strong>Breaking topic flow:</strong> Don't separate closely related ideas unnecessarily</li>
                    <li><strong>Creating awkward transitions:</strong> Ensure smooth connections between sentences</li>
                    <li><strong>Rushing the decision:</strong> Test each option thoroughly before choosing</li>

                <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
                <p>Logical placement questions test your understanding of how ideas should flow within a paragraph. Focus on chronological order, cause-and-effect relationships, and topical coherence. Always test each placement option by reading the paragraph with the sentence in different positions to ensure the most logical and smooth flow of ideas.</p>
