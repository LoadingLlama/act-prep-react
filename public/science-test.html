                    <div class="passage-text">
                        <p>Scientists studied the behavior of green anoles (Anolis carolinensis) in controlled laboratory environments to understand their territorial and social behaviors. The study examined how factors such as temperature, habitat structure, and population density affect anole behavior patterns.</p>

                        <p><strong>Experiment 1:</strong> Researchers placed individual male anoles in terrariums with different temperature settings (20°C, 25°C, 30°C, and 35°C) and recorded their activity levels over 24-hour periods. Activity was measured by the number of movements per hour.</p>

                        <p><strong>Results:</strong> Activity levels increased with temperature up to 30°C, then decreased at 35°C. Peak activity occurred at 30°C with an average of 42 movements per hour.</p>

                        <p><strong>Experiment 2:</strong> Male anoles were placed in terrariums with varying numbers of perches and hiding spots. Territorial displays (head bobbing and dewlap extension) were recorded for each setup.</p>

                        <p><strong>Results:</strong> Territorial displays increased with the number of perches available, reaching a maximum when 4-6 perches were present per terrarium.</p>

                        <p><strong>Experiment 3:</strong> Population density effects were studied by placing different numbers of anoles (1, 2, 4, or 8) in identical terrariums and measuring stress indicators such as color changes and cortisol levels.</p>

                        <p><strong>Results:</strong> Stress indicators increased significantly when more than 4 anoles were housed together in the same terrarium size.</p>

                        <p>Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy required. The activity of enzymes is highly dependent on environmental conditions, particularly pH and temperature. Students conducted experiments to determine the optimal pH for different enzymes.</p>
                        <p><strong>Experiment 1:</strong> Students tested the activity of catalase enzyme at different pH levels (4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12) by measuring the rate of oxygen gas production when hydrogen peroxide was broken down. The reaction was carried out at 25°C for 5 minutes.</p>

                        <p><strong>Experiment 2:</strong> Students tested pepsin enzyme activity by measuring protein digestion at various pH levels (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8). Protein breakdown was measured as the decrease in protein concentration over 30 minutes at 37°C.</p>

                        <p>Scientists studied inheritance patterns in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) to understand how traits are passed from parents to offspring. They focused on wing shape and eye color traits.</p>
                        <p><strong>Study 1:</strong> Researchers crossed normal-winged flies with vestigial-winged flies. All F₁ offspring had normal wings. When F₁ flies were crossed with each other, the F₂ generation showed a 3:1 ratio of normal to vestigial wings.</p>

                        <p>Ecologists studied primary succession on recently exposed volcanic rock to understand how communities change over time. They monitored species diversity and biomass over a 50-year period.</p>
                        <p><strong>Stage 1 (Years 0-5):</strong> Pioneer species including lichens and mosses colonize bare rock. Total species count: 12, Total biomass: 2 kg/hectare</p>
                        <p><strong>Stage 2 (Years 6-15):</strong> Grasses and small shrubs establish. Total species count: 28, Total biomass: 15 kg/hectare</p>
                        <p><strong>Stage 3 (Years 16-35):</strong> Small trees and larger shrubs dominate. Total species count: 45, Total biomass: 125 kg/hectare</p>
                        <p><strong>Stage 4 (Years 36-50):</strong> Mature forest development begins. Total species count: 67, Total biomass: 380 kg/hectare</p>
                        <p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> The researchers also measured soil depth, which increased from 0 cm initially to 15 cm after 50 years, with the most rapid increase occurring during years 10-25.</p>
                        <p><strong>Additional Data:</strong> pH levels changed from 6.2 (acidic, due to lichen acids) in early stages to 7.1 (neutral) in later stages as organic matter accumulated.</p>
