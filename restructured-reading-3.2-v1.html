1. Tip #1 — Keep it Moving
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Time management is critical for success on the Reading Test
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You have 9 minutes per passage for normal time and 15 minutes per passage for extended time</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">To finish all 4 passages consistently, it's important to know when to guess and move on to the next question</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">In general, never spend more than 1 minute on any single question (1.5 minutes for extended time)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Developing Time Management
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">At first, it may be hard to manage time and know when to move on
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You'll get a better sense of time management as you complete practice ACTs</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">With practice, you'll develop a voice in your head saying "It's time to bubble in your best guess and move on"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is especially true on the first 4-6 questions of each passage—follow the 30-second rule!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you can't find the correct part of the passage quickly, circle the question number and move on</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You may come across the evidence as you answer questions in the rest of the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You can always go back and change your answer if you find the evidence later</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Knowing when to move on will increase your score
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">We know it feels weird moving on without being confident in your answer choice</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">But moving on allows you to answer more questions and avoid guessing as time runs out</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Tip #2 — Circle Guesses; Box Non-Confident Answers
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Circle guesses:</strong> Whenever you guess on a question, circle the question number on your test
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you finish with time left, go back to the circled questions you guessed on</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Spend more time looking for the Waldo</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The question may also seem easier when you come back to it a second time</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Box non-confident answers:</strong> If you're not confident in your answer, box the question number on your test
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you have time left after going back to circled questions, you can look over these boxed questions again</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Only change your answer if you have a very good reason—you're usually correct on your first attempt</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">However, if you realize you misread the question, didn't notice a detail in the passage, or notice something that makes your answer choice incorrect, change your answer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Tip #3 — Never Worry About Patterns in the Answer Choices
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">"I bubbled in A and F for the last 4 questions. There is no way this one can be A again, right??" WRONG!
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When answering a question, only focus on that question</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Never let any pattern in the answer choices affect which answer choice you pick</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sometimes, the same spot on the scantron sheet is correct 4 or even 5 times in a row on the ACT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It's also possible that you answered one of the previous questions incorrectly, and there aren't supposed to be 4 or 5 in a row</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">There's no way for you to know on test day, so just focus on selecting what you think is correct for each question</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Tip #4 — Boring is Better
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Boring answer choices are usually better on the ACT
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you're ever between two answer choices, always pick the more boring answer choice</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The more specific an answer choice is, the more likely something in that answer choice is incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Remember: An answer choice must be 100% correct to be correct</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Why We Pick Specific Answer Choices (and Why We Shouldn't)
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The challenge is that we don't like to pick boring answer choices, especially on challenging questions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">An answer choice with more details is much easier to come up with a story as to why the answer could be correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This makes you feel better bubbling it in</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Your job is to pick the answer choice that is supported by the passage, not the one that feels best to you</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">So again, when you're between two answer choices, pick the boring one with fewer details</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
5. Tip #5 — Beware of Keyword Matching
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Anytime you see words in an answer choice that directly match words from the passage, proceed with caution
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Make sure the entire answer choice is correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Matching keywords may be in the correct answer choice, but they can also be in incorrect answer choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These incorrect choices are often half-truths, where part of the answer choice perfectly matches the passage but another part is incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Students often mistakenly pick these incorrect answer choices because the keywords match</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Never just match keywords—always make sure the answer choice you select is 100% correct</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
6. Tip #6 — Do Not Over-Annotate
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Some students annotate a lot. Others make no annotations at all. There is no right or wrong way to annotate.
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You need to find what works best for you</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">What's most important is to make sure that annotating is helping you better understand the passage and work through the questions more efficiently</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you're underlining 50% of the passage, those are not helpful annotations</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you're writing down notes after each paragraph but never use those notes, you're wasting time</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
What Good Annotations Should Do
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Proper annotations should help you:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Maintain focus as you read</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Increase your comprehension of what you read</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Know where in the passage to go when working through the questions</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">There is no best way to annotate for everyone—how much you annotate and what types of annotations you use varies from student to student</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">On practice ACTs, try different methods for annotation and find what works best for you</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
7. Tip #7 — Make the Most of Practice ACTs
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Practice ACTs are the best way to improve on the Reading Test...if you're using and reviewing them properly
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Here are some tips for how to make the most of your practice ACTs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Always Time Practice ACTs Strictly
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Never give yourself extra time to finish the section and see how you would have scored
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It will give you false confidence for how much you're improving</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Strict timing is essential to building the time management skills you need on test day</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Review Your Mistakes Thoroughly
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Whenever you answer a question incorrectly, go back to the passage and find the evidence for the correct answer
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Make sure you identify why your answer choice was incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It is critical to learn from every single mistake you make to continuously improve</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Be Obsessive About Improving
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Students who improve the most on the Reading Test are the ones who are most obsessive about learning from their mistakes
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">After each question, try to figure out why you missed the question</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Did you not read the question carefully enough?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Were you answering your own question and not exactly what the ACT was asking you?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Did you not recognize the type of question?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Once you figure out why you made the mistake, think about how you can avoid the mistake in the future</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If necessary, go review any topic(s) from the chapters we have already covered</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Key Takeaways
</h3>

<ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Keep it moving—never spend more than 1 minute on any single question (1.5 for extended time). Follow the 30-second rule on the first 4-6 questions, and if you can't find the right part of the passage quickly, circle the question number and move on. Knowing when to move on increases your score by allowing you to answer more questions and avoid guessing as time runs out.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Circle guesses and box non-confident answers—if you finish with time, go back to circled questions first, then boxed questions. Never worry about patterns in answer choices (the same letter can be correct 4-5 times in a row). Only change answers if you have a very good reason—you're usually correct on your first attempt.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Boring is better—when stuck between two answer choices, always pick the more boring one with fewer details. The more specific an answer choice is, the more likely something in it is incorrect. Beware of keyword matching—just because an answer choice has matching keywords doesn't mean it's correct; these are often half-truths where part matches but another part is incorrect.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Don't over-annotate—proper annotations should help you maintain focus, increase comprehension, and know where to go when working through questions. If you're underlining 50% of the passage or writing notes you never use, you're wasting time. Make the most of practice ACTs by always timing strictly, reviewing mistakes thoroughly, and being obsessive about learning from every error to continuously improve.
