<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Understanding <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">misplaced modifiers</strong> is one of the most essential skills for achieving a high score on the ACT English Test. A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong> is a word, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong>, or <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">clause</strong> that describes or provides additional information about another word in the sentence. When a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong> is separated from the word it describes, the sentence becomes confusing or takes on an unintended meaning. Mastering the rules for proper modifier placement will help you quickly identify these errors and select the correct answer choice on test day.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">1. What Are Misplaced Modifiers?</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">misplaced modifier</strong> is a word, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong>, or <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">clause</strong> that is improperly separated from the noun or <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun</strong> it is meant to modify. When a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong> is in the wrong position, it can accidentally describe the wrong word, leading to awkward, confusing, or even humorous sentences.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The key rule to remember is the "next-door neighbor rule": a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong> must be placed directly next to the word it modifies. If the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong> is separated from its target word, the sentence will have an incorrect or unintended meaning.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">There are several types of <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">misplaced modifiers</strong> that appear on the ACT:</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Introductory modifiers:</strong> These appear at the beginning of a sentence followed by a comma. The first noun after the comma must be what the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong> describes.</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Mid-sentence modifiers:</strong> These appear in the middle of a sentence, often set off by commas. They must directly follow the word they modify.</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>End-of-sentence modifiers:</strong> These appear at the end of a sentence and must directly follow the word they describe.</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Dangling modifiers:</strong> A special type where the word being modified is missing entirely from the sentence, leaving the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong> with nothing to describe.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Consider this incorrect example: "Consistently erupting, Jack loves taking pictures of the Old Faithful geyser at Yellowstone National Park." The introductory <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> "consistently erupting" is meant to describe the geyser, but it is mistakenly placed next to "Jack," making it sound like Jack is consistently erupting. The correct version would be: "Consistently erupting, the Old Faithful geyser at Yellowstone National Park is one of Jack's favorite things to photograph."</p>

<h4 style="margin: 0 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 0.75rem; border-left: 4px solid #b91c1c; color: #000000; font-weight: 700;">Example 1: Introductory Modifier</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Not popular since the early 1980s, the documentary about mullets explored the origins of the wildly popular hairstyle.</p>

<p style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">A. NO CHANGE</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">B. the documentary explored the origins of mullets, a wildly popular hairstyle not seen since the early 1980s.</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">C. mullets were the topic of a recently released documentary exploring the origins of the wildly popular hairstyle.</span><br>

</p>

<p style="margin: 1.5rem 0 0.75rem 0;"><strong>Solution:</strong></p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Identify the introductory <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong>. The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> "not popular since the early 1980s" is the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong> at the beginning of the sentence.</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Determine what the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong> describes. The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> describes something that was not popular since the early 1980s. That would be mullets (the hairstyle), not the documentary.</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Check which answer choice places the correct word immediately after the comma. In choice A, "the documentary" comes first, which is incorrect. In choice B, the structure is rearranged but still has issues with what follows the comma. In choice C, "mullets" comes immediately after the comma, which is correct.</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Verify the sentence makes logical sense. "Not popular since the early 1980s, mullets were the topic of a recently released documentary" correctly places the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong> next to what it describes.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"><strong>Answer: C</strong></p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">2. How to Fix Misplaced Modifiers</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Follow these proven techniques to identify and correct <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">misplaced modifiers</strong> on the ACT:</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Technique 1: Apply the Next-Door Neighbor Rule</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">For introductory modifiers separated by a comma, the first noun or <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun</strong> after the comma must be the word the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong> describes. This is the most common type of <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">misplaced modifier</strong> on the ACT.</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Read the introductory <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> or <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">clause</strong> before the comma</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Ask yourself: "Who or what is this <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> describing?"</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Check if that person, place, or thing appears immediately after the comma</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">If not, eliminate that answer choice and look for one that places the correct word first</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Example: "Running from the police, Eric hopped the fence and hid underneath a car." The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> "running from the police" describes Eric, and Eric is correctly placed immediately after the comma.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Technique 2: Reorder the Sentence Structure</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">When the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong> cannot easily be moved next to the word it describes, you may need to restructure the entire sentence. This often involves moving the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong> from the beginning to the middle or end of the sentence.</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Identify the word being modified</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Look for answer choices that place the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong> immediately before or after that word</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">For mid-sentence modifiers, place commas around the descriptive <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong></li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">For end-of-sentence modifiers, place the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong> directly after the word it describes</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Example: "The research team tracked the movements of the blue storks, which arrived at their nesting grounds early this year." The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong> "which arrived at their nesting grounds early this year" is correctly placed at the end of the sentence, immediately after "blue storks."</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Technique 3: Convert the Phrase to a Clause</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Another way to fix a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">misplaced modifier</strong> is to add a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong> and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong> to the modifying <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong>, converting it into a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">dependent clause</strong>. This makes it clear exactly who or what is performing the action.</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Add a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">subordinating conjunction</strong> such as "because," "since," "when," or "while"</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Include a clear <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong> (often a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun</strong> like "it," "he," "she," or "they")</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Add an appropriate <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong> to complete the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">clause</strong></li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Example: "Since it is consistently erupting, Jack loves taking pictures of the Old Faithful geyser at Yellowstone National Park." By adding "since" and "it is," we convert the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> "consistently erupting" into a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">dependent clause</strong> that clearly describes the geyser.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Technique 4: Watch for Scrambled Answer Choices</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">On the ACT, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">misplaced modifier</strong> questions have a distinctive appearance that helps you recognize them quickly. Learning to spot these questions is half the battle.</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">All four answer choices are similar in length</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">The answer choices contain the same words arranged in different orders</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">The first word or <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> varies across the answer choices</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">When you spot these clues, immediately identify the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong> and determine what it describes</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin: 0 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 0.75rem; border-left: 4px solid #b91c1c; color: #000000; font-weight: 700;">Example 2: Mid-Sentence Modifier</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The research team, which arrived at their nesting grounds early this year, tracked the movements of the blue storks.</p>

<p style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">A. NO CHANGE</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">B. The research team tracked the movements of the blue storks, which arrived at their nesting grounds early this year.</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">C. The research team, which tracked the movements of the blue storks, noted that the birds arrived at their nesting grounds early this year.</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">D. Tracking the movements of the blue storks, the research team discovered they arrived at their nesting grounds early this year.</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">E. The blue storks, tracked by the research team, arrived at their nesting grounds early this year.</span>
</p>

<p style="margin: 1.5rem 0 0.75rem 0;"><strong>Solution:</strong></p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Identify the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong>. The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">clause</strong> "which arrived at their nesting grounds early this year" is the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong> set off by commas.</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Determine what the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong> describes. What arrived at nesting grounds early? The blue storks, not the research team.</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Apply the next-door neighbor rule. In choice A, the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong> comes right after "research team," which is incorrect. In choice B, the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong> comes right after "blue storks," which is correct.</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Verify the sentence is clear and logical. Choice B correctly places the descriptive <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">clause</strong> at the end of the sentence, immediately after "blue storks."</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"><strong>Answer: B</strong></p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">3. Common Modifier Mistakes</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Certain types of <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">misplaced modifiers</strong> appear repeatedly on the ACT English Test. Understanding these common patterns will help you spot errors quickly and avoid traps in the answer choices.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Mistake 1: Assuming You Know What the Sentence Means</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The biggest challenge with <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">misplaced modifiers</strong> is that our brains automatically correct them when we read. We usually understand what the sentence is trying to say, even when it is grammatically incorrect. This makes <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">misplaced modifiers</strong> difficult to spot unless you deliberately check modifier placement.</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Always identify the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong> and consciously ask what it describes</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Do not rely on your intuitive understanding of the sentence</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Check that the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong> is next to the correct word, not just near it</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Mistake 2: Ignoring Modifiers Without Commas</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Not all modifiers are set off by commas. Some appear as <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">relative clauses</strong> starting with "that" or "which," or as participial <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong> ending in "-ing" or "-ed." These still follow the next-door neighbor rule.</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Look for <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong> starting with "that," "which," or "who"</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Watch for words ending in "-ing" (walking, running, thinking) or "-ed" (caught, broken, designed)</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Verify these modifying <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong> are next to the word they describe</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Example: "A tarantula bit one of my coworkers that had a huge, hairy body." The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> "that had a huge, hairy body" should describe the tarantula, not the coworker. The correct version places the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong> next to "tarantula": "A tarantula that had a huge, hairy body bit one of my coworkers."</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Mistake 3: Misplacing Prepositional Phrases</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Prepositional phrases</strong> (such as "in the stands," "on the table," "with automatic parking") can also act as modifiers. These are tested less frequently on the ACT but can be tricky because they are easily overlooked.</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Identify <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">prepositional phrases</strong> that describe a noun</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Check if the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> is placed next to the correct word</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Be especially careful when the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">prepositional phrase</strong> appears at the end of the sentence</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Example: "Paul and his father talked about the baseball game in the stands." The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">prepositional phrase</strong> "in the stands" should describe where Paul and his father were located, not where the baseball game was. The correct version is: "In the stands, Paul and his father talked about the baseball game."</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Mistake 4: Overlooking Modifiers in Parentheses</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Modifying <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong> set apart by parentheses are rare on the ACT, but they still follow the next-door neighbor rule. The word being modified must appear immediately before the opening parenthesis.</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Identify what the parenthetical <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> is defining or describing</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Check that this word appears directly before the opening parenthesis</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Reorder the sentence if necessary to place the word in the correct position</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Example: "The scientists tried to develop a new method to make their self-pollination study (where pollen from the same plant arrives at the stigma of the flower) completely free of pollen contamination." The parenthetical <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> defines "self-pollination," not "study," so the correct version is: "The scientists tried to develop a new method to study self-pollination (where pollen from the same plant arrives at the stigma of the flower) completely free of pollen contamination."</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Mistake 5: Choosing Answer Choices Based on Flow Rather Than Grammar</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Many students mistakenly treat <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">misplaced modifier</strong> questions as questions about phrasing or sentence flow. While some answer choices may sound better than others, the correct answer is determined by grammar rules, not by personal preference.</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Do not select an answer because it "sounds good" or "flows well"</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Always apply the next-door neighbor rule systematically</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Eliminate answer choices where the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong> is separated from the word it describes</li>

<p style="margin: 1.5rem 0 0.75rem 0;"><strong>Solution:</strong></p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Recognize this is a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">misplaced modifier</strong> question. Notice that all answer choices are similar in length, contain the same words in different orders, and vary in what comes after the comma.</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Identify the introductory <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong>. The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> "analyzing the ultraviolet camera footage" is the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong>.</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Determine what the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong> describes. Ask: "Who or what is analyzing the ultraviolet camera footage?" The scientists are analyzing the footage, not the fish or the UV coloration.</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Check which answer choice places "scientists" immediately after the comma. Choice A places "scientists" right after the comma, which is correct. Choices B, C, D, and E all place different words or <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong> after the comma, none of which are doing the analyzing.</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 5:</strong> Verify the sentence makes sense. "Analyzing the ultraviolet camera footage, scientists discovered that fish communicate using UV coloration and signaling" correctly connects the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">modifier</strong> to the scientists who performed the action.</li>
</ul>
