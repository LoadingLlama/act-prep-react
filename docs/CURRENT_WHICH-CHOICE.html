<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">‚ÄúWhich choice‚Äù questions ask you to make changes to a sentence or portions of a sentence. The changes</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">that should be made will be detailed in the questions itself. These questions are very easy to spot: the</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">question will always have the words ‚Äúwhich choice‚Äù (more common) or ‚Äúwhich one‚Äù (less</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">common) in the question.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">For ‚Äúwhich choice‚Äù questions, your job is to figure out exactly what the question is asking you to do</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">and select the answer choice that does that. Do not worry about grammar, conciseness, or style,</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">as these are never tested on these questions unless the question specifically asks about grammar,</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">conciseness, or style. For ‚Äúwhich choice‚Äù questions, shorter is NOT always better.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The first type of ‚Äúwhich choice‚Äù question asks you to make a specific change to the sentence. For</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">these questions, focus on the sentence you are being asKed to edit. You should still read the sentences</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">before and after the underlined portion, but you often will not need to rely too much on the context.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Which choice most specifically describes what</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">was used to build iceboxes?</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">the 1920s. Before their invention, Americans</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">people to keep food cold in their houses.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Notice that all of the answer choices are grammatically correct. Your job here is to pick the answer that</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">‚Äúmost specifically describes what was used to build iceboxes.‚Äù Therefore, the answer must be C since it</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">is the only answer choice that has any information about the materials used to build iceboxes.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Which choice most clearly emphasizes how the</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">always begged his Mom for some of the</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">A. NO CHANGE</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">grow-in-water dinosaurs that sprawl when</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">into water.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">D. soak</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Again, notice that all four answers choices are grammatically correct. To answer this question, we must</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">focus on which answer choice ‚Äúemphasizes how the dinosaurs increase in size.‚Äù Therefore, the answer</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">choice C is correct, as ‚Äúexpand‚Äù highlights how the dinosaurs increase in size.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0; color: #1e3a8a;">For ‚Äúwhich choice‚Äù questions, just answer the question that the ACT is asking. It‚Äôs that simple! We cannot stress this enough. As long as you approach these questions correctly, they should be easy. This is particularly important for the questions about specific details. For example, if the questions asks, ‚Äúwhich answer choice best highlights the colors of autumn,‚Äù pick the answer choice that has colors in it. For the majority of the ‚Äúwhich choice‚Äù questions, it‚Äôs really that easy! PrepPros ACT English Course The second type of ‚Äúwhich choice‚Äù question asks you to select the correct sentence based on the context in the passage. Most commonly, you need to select the correct introduction, conclusion, or <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">transition</strong>. For these questions, you will need to read for context. In general, it is good practice to read the 2 sentences before and the 2 sentences after, but you may need to read more than that for certain questions. When first reading for context, ignore the underlined portion. Focus on where the question is directing you to read. If the question asks, ‚Äúwhich choice best introduces the paragraph,‚Äù you need to read the entire paragraph before selecting your answer. The most common mistake students make is answering the question before reading the entire paragraph. If you do that, you do not really know what the paragraph is about yet and can very easily pick the incorrect answer. Recently, many businesses have been adding Given that all the choices are accurate, which choice provides the best conclusion to the color to the workplace to boost employee paragraph? morale and creativeness.
