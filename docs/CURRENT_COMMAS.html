<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Chapter 2: Commas - 4 Types of Commas</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Commas are the most common type of punctuation on the English Test. In order to successfully handle</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">comma questions, we need to become familiar with the 4 types of commas that appear on the ACT.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">So far, we have already discussed the first two types of commas.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">1. Comma + <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">FANBOYS</strong></p>

<div style="background-color: #d1fae5; border-left: 4px solid #10b981; padding: 1rem 1.5rem; margin: 1rem 0; border-radius: 4px;">
  <p style="font-weight: 700; color: #065f46; margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">‚úì Correct</p>
  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0; color: #065f46;">My alarm clock did not go off this morning, so I arrived late at school.</p>
</div>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Use a comma and a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">FANBOYS</strong> (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) to join two <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">independent clauses</strong>.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">2. <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Dependent clause</strong> followed by <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">independent clause</strong></p>

<div style="background-color: #d1fae5; border-left: 4px solid #10b981; padding: 1rem 1.5rem; margin: 1rem 0; border-radius: 4px;">
  <p style="font-weight: 700; color: #065f46; margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">‚úì Correct</p>
  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0; color: #065f46;">While electronic music has become very popular, many people still prefer classic rock.</p>
</div>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">If a sentence has a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">dependent clause</strong> followed by an <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">independent clause</strong>, you must link these with a</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">comma.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Next, we will learn the other 2 types of commas in English and on the ACT:</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">3. Unnecessary Information</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Commas are used to separate unnecessary information from the rest of the sentence. Information is</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">unnecessary if we can remove it without fundamentally changing the meaning of the sentence.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Unnecessary information can be as short as a single word or as long as a lengthy <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong>.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Example: Mrs. Ellison, who is known for giving pop quizzes, is my least favorite teacher.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Example: The snowboard in the closet, the one with no stickers on it, needs to be waxed.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Example: The basketball team, though, did not mount a comeback this week.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">4. Listing</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Commas are used when listing more than two items and with lists of multiple adjectives modifying the</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">same noun.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Example: The group at the picnic table ordered coconut shrimp, hot wings, and onion rings.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Example: The old, limping dog still managed to complete the 3-mile hike.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Unnecessary Information Commas</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The most common type of comma in English and on the ACT separates unnecessary information from</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">the rest of the sentence. Information is unnecessary if we can remove the information from the sentence</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">without fundamentally changing the meaning of the sentence. Unnecessary information can be</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">before a comma, after a comma, or between two commas.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Sitting behind the table, Mark waited to jump out and surprise his mother.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Dale grabbed his favorite surfboard, the blue and green one, and paddled out.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Buddy the Elf handed his father a bag of spaghetti, his face covered in syrup.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The real winner, however, had yet to be revealed.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">In the sentences above, the unnecessary information is underlined. Each of these sentences still works if</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">we ignore unnecessary information. That‚Äôs how we know it is unnecessary and the commas are correct!</p>

<div style="background-color: #eff6ff; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 4px;">
  <h4 style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 700; margin: 0 0 0.75rem 0; font-size: 1.1rem;">üí° TIP: The ‚ÄúCrossing-Out‚Äù Trick</h4>
  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0; color: #1e3a8a;">For unnecessary information commas, you must be able to completely remove the unnecessary information from the sentence. After removing the unnecessary information, what remains must still be a complete sentence that can stand by itself. To test if information is unnecessary, cross out the information and read the sentence without it. If you can cross out the information and the sentence still reads as a complete sentence, the information is unnecessary and needs to be set apart by acomma or commas. If you cannot cross out the information, it should not be set apart by any commas. Let‚Äôs test with the sentence below. All three versions are the same sentence, but the commas are in different locations. The wooden beam set at an angle, created an optical illusion. The wooden beam, set at an angle created an optical illusion. The wooden beam, set at an angle, created an optical illusion. For the first two sentences, a single comma must set apart the information either before or after it as unnecessary. Let‚Äôs check if these work. The weeden beam setatananele, created an optical illusion. The wooden beam set at an angle, ereated-an-opticaltusion. The wooden beam, setatanangle created anopticaltusion. The weedenbeam, set at an angle created an optical illusion. Well...none of those work for the first two sentences. Let‚Äôs try the third. A pair of commas can either separate the information between them or the information before and after. The weeden beam, set at an angle, ereated an opticaltusion. The wooden beam, setatanangle, created an optical illusion. (Yes, it works!) Using this trick can be very helpful on unnecessary information commas questions. PrepPros ACT English Course Unnecessary vs. Necessary Information At times, we will also need to determine if information is indeed unnecessary or not. These sentences are more challenging, but the trick is to delete the portion that may be unnecessary and see if the sentence loses any critical information. Consider the two sentences below: Correct: The dresses that need to be hemmed are hanging in the closet. Correct: Judith, who went to fashion school, designs dresses for a living. Why do we have no commas in the first sentence and commas for the second? In the first sentence, the information is necessary. If we just say, ‚Äúthe dresses are hanging in the closet,‚Äù then we do not know which specific dresses we are talking about. In the second sentence, we already know who designs the dresses, so the information about Judith going to fashion school is unnecessary. The Names Rule The ACT loves to ask you how to properly punctuate names. You are almost guaranteed to see at least one commas and names question on test day. You have probably seen names written both with and without commas...so what‚Äôs the difference? Both versions below are correct: see if you can figure out why. Correct: My friend Kelly recently moved to London. Correct: My best friend, Andrew, is a certified scuba diver. The names rule has to do with specificity. If the identifier before the name is not specific to one person (friend, American physicist, Olympic gold medalist, high school principal), the name is necessary, and there is no comma between the identifier and the name. If the identifier is specific to one person (best friend, youngest sister, Amazon CEO), the name is unnecessary information, and there are commas around the name. In the first sentence, Kelly is necessary because without her name we do not know which friend recently moved to London. In the second sentence, Andrew is unnecessary because a person can only have one best friend. We do not need the name Andrew to know who we are talking about. Names Rule Practice: Determine if the names below need commas or not. bDFYONPW Award-winning teacher Mrs. Saunders helped me become a much better writer. Broadway producer Jeffrey Seller is best known for the huge hit Hamilton. Eric‚Äôs mother Louisa cheered from the bleachers. Italian cyclist Marco Pantani won the Tour de France in 1998. Famous American entrepreneur Elon Musk is a proponent of bitcoin. The CEO of Tesla Elon Musk has revolutionized the car industry. Grammy winner Arianna Grande is releasing a new album next month. The oldest Hemswroth brother Luke Hemsworth starred in HBO‚Äôs Westworld. PrepPros ACT English Course ‚ÄúThat‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúWhich‚Äù <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Phrases</strong> <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Phrases</strong> that start with ‚Äúthat‚Äù never get commas. <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Phrases</strong> that start with ‚Äúwhich‚Äù always get commas. ‚ÄúThat‚Äù <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong> are always necessary information to the sentence while ‚Äúwhich‚Äù <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong> are always unnecessary information. Correct: The dogs that live down the street are always barking. Correct: My neighbor‚Äôs dogs, which are always barking, love to play fetch. Anytime you see ‚Äúwhich,‚Äù there must be a comma right in front of it. The exception to this rule is when ‚Äúwhich‚Äù is part of a prepositional <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> like ‚Äúon which,‚Äù ‚Äúin which‚Äù or ‚Äúof which.‚Äù For any of these or other similar cases, you do not use a comma. Some examples are below: Correct: The table on which the food was resting tipped over. Correct: The table, which the food was resting on, tipped over. ‚Äúing‚Äù and ‚Äúed‚Äù <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Phrases</strong> <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Phrases</strong> that start with ‚Äúing‚Äù and ‚Äúed‚Äù may or may not be separated with commas. To determine if these <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong>, which are called participle <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong>, get commas or not, determine if the information in the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> is necessary to the sentence or not. On the ACT, ‚Äúing‚Äù and ‚Äúed‚Äù <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong> most commonly appear with commas and are unnecessary information. Correct: Excited for the car ride, Jane‚Äôs bulldog started to jump up and down. Correct: Jane‚Äôs bulldog, excited for the car ride, started to jump up and down. Correct: Marcus applied for the internship, hoping that he would get the position. Correct: Judy laid down, exhausted from the long workout. ‚Äúing‚Äù and ‚Äúed‚Äù <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong> can also be necessary information when the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> is helping to specify who or what the noun is. If the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> is necessary, there are no commas. Correct: The politician waving to the crowd is predicted to win the election. Correct: The yoga pants advertised on the front page of the website were sold out. In the first example, ‚Äúwaving to the crowd‚Äù is helping to specify which politician is predicted to win the election. In the second example, ‚Äúadvertised on the front page of the website‚Äù is specifying which yoga pants are sold out. Without these <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong>, we would not know which specific politician or yoga pants are being referred to. <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Phrases</strong> with ‚ÄúWho‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhom‚Äù When talking about a person, you must always use ‚Äúwho‚Äù or ‚Äúwhom‚Äô to start the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong>. You can never use ‚Äúthat‚Äù to describe a person. ‚ÄúWho‚Äù or ‚Äúwhom‚Äù can act like a ‚Äúthat‚Äù or a ‚Äúwhich‚Äù <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong>, so these ones are a bit trickier with commas. We will cover ‚Äúwho vs. whom‚Äù later in the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronouns</strong> chapter. Incorrect: The children that were playing soccer did not notice the ice cream truck. Correct: The children who were playing soccer did not notice the ice cream truck. Correct: Dr. Roberts, who was my childhood doctor, waved to me at the supermarket. PrepPros ACT English Course Prepositional <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Phrases</strong> Prepositional <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong> are <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong> consisting ofa preposition and its object. Some of the most common prepositions on the ACT are listed below: in of to for with on at from by about as into like through after over between during before among around Prepositional <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong> at the front of the sentence are always followed by a comma. We can think of these <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong> as unnecessary information that we can cross out. Correct: On my way to work, | listened to my new favorite podcast. Correct: After cleaning the garage, Ralph started weeding the garden. Prepositional <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong> in the middle or end of a sentence almost never have commas around them. Most prepositional <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong> contain essential information that helps specify the noun that the prepositional <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> is modifying and therefore is necessary. Correct: The clothing on the bed is for vacation. The clothing on the floor is being donated. Without the prepositional <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong>, we would not know which clothing is for vacation and which is being donated. Here are some more examples: Correct: The display of affection by Lewis to his prom date made her blush. Correct: The bouquet of lilies in the vase is going to be displayed on the table. On the ACT, 99% of prepositional <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong> do not have commas like the examples above, so in general you should never put commas around a prepositional <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong>. Prepositional <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong> in the middle or end of a sentence only get comma(s) if they contain unnecessary information. Correct: My mother, with her love of Easter, organized a massive Easter egg hunt. Incorrect: The magician had a rabbit, in his hat. Here, the first prepositional <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> is unnecessary because we already know which mother we are talking about. The second prepositional <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> is necessary since it specifies which rabbit we are talking about, so there should be no comma. Prepositional <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong> that are unnecessary almost never come up on the ACT. Prepositional <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Phrases</strong> Practice: Underline all prepositional <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong>. Add commas if necessary. 1. Before the race began the team did a final check on the sparkplugs in the engine. 2. Donations for the campaign in Georgia broke records during the 2020 election. 3. The luxury dog bed with the ornate frame and supportive memory foam seemsa bit excessive to me. 4. During the movie Davonta‚Äôs mother went to the concession stand for some popcorn. At the corner the host stood with a microphone in her hand. PrepPros ACT English Course Punctuation for Transitional Words and <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Phrases</strong> Like ‚ÄúHowever‚Äù On the ACT, there are certain words and short <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong> that often give students trouble on grammar questions. These words are technically called conjunctive adverbs (you do NOT need to know that). We prefer to just think of these as transitional words and <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong> like ‚Äúhowever.‚Äù Below is a list of the most commonly tested ones: However Though Therefore Instead Likewise Nevertheless Regardless Moreover Subsequently Furthermore In addition As a result Of course Otherwise For example There are three ways that these transitional words and <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong> can appear in a correctly punctuated sentence. 1. At the front of the sentence followed by a comma. Correct: However, the truth would not be revealed until next week. Correct: As a result, the student was sent to the principal‚Äôs office. This is another example of unnecessary information. For both of these sentences, we can cross out the transitional word or <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> and are left with a complete sentence. 2. Separated by commas in the middle of a sentence. Correct: The truth, however, would not be revealed until next week. Correct: The student, as a result, was sent to the principal‚Äôs office. Again, this is unnecessary information. We can cross out the transitional word or <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> and read the rest of the sentence as one complete sentence. 3. Separated by a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">semicolon</strong> and a comma when between two <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">independent clauses</strong>. Correct: I expected to pay over $100 for my new hiking boots; however, I found a sale and got them for half of the original price. Correct: The player demanded his coach for more playing time; in addition, he threatened to quit if he did not get his way. If there is an <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">independent clause</strong> before and after the transitional word or <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong>, we need to use a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">semicolon</strong> and a comma for punctuation.

  <h4 style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 700; margin: 0 0 0.75rem 0; font-size: 1.1rem;">üí° TIP: How to Spot Unnecessary Information Commas Questions</h4>
  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0; color: #1e3a8a;">Unnecessary information commas questions always have two defining characteristics: 1. The words in all 4 answer choices are the exact same. 2. The only difference in the answer choices is where commas are located. On the ACT, unnecessary information commas questions look like this: Electric vehicles, thousands of them, 1. Which choice makes the sentence most grammatically acceptable? already on the road in America, are one of the fastest growing industries in the world. A. NO CHANGE B. thousands, of them C. thousands of them D. thousands of, them Anytime we see a question like this, we are dealing with an unnecessary information commas question and should use the ‚Äúcrossing-out‚Äù trick. Be sure to read the entire sentence and pay attention to any other commas that are not in the underlined portion! Any commas that we cannot change are often important clues that we must use to find the correct answer. It is possible the other comma rules are part of a question like this as well, so make sure to read the entire sentence and look out for the sentence structure rules from Chapter 1. In the example above, the answer is C because the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> ‚Äúthousands of them already on the road in America‚Äù is unnecessary information and is separated by two commas. Backup Trick - Pauses and Commas Read the sentence out loud (or ‚Äúout loud‚Äù in your head on test day) to help identify where commas are necessary. If you need to take a short pause for a breath, then you likely need a comma. Read the example below out loud and put commas where you take a short pause: Originally from Maine Mr. Johnson who has taught 8 grade biology for five years is not accustomed to winters in San Diego. Pausing is not one of our 4 commas rules! Many students mistakenly put commas anywhere they pause in sentence. At times, this is a great trick. However, this can also lead to mistakes. You should only using pausing as a backup trick when you have already used our other commas rules and still cannot tell which answer choice is correct. For the example above, the correct version is below: Correct: Originally from Maine, Mr. Johnson, who has taught 8" grade biology for five years, is not accustomed to winters in San Diego. PrepPros ACT English Course Commas Practice: Add commas where necessary. The commas in the sentences below can be any of the first 3 types of commas we have learned so far. 1. Although James demanded pizza for dinner his mother decided to make grilled chicken and broccoli instead. Mr. Alvin a very popular teacher among the students cancelled the final exam. I could not believe that Deadpool was such a popular movie. While my friend Mary thought that dolphins were the fastest animals in water she was surprised to learn it was actually a sailfish. Owls notorious for their amazing night vision have fantastic hearing at night so they can actually hear their prey from hundreds of feet away even if they cannot see it. On second thought the real reason that I did not like Scott was his lack of honesty. Some cultures though enjoy bizarre foods like bugs or snakes. After graduating Darren played for the San Diego Padres where he had a long career as a relief pitcher. Because he was the best in Dallas award-winning head chef Phillip Small owned multiple very successful restaurants. 10. My favorite author is J.K. Rowling who is famous for writing the Harry Potter series. 11. The fisherman carrying their catch walked into the Seattle fish market a place famous for how the vendors throw fish to entertain customers. 12. At first glance the cuttlefish which can change colors to blend into its surroundings looked just like the brain coral behind it and I did not see it in the tank. 13. Last summer the local flooding caused by a breach in the Reynolds Dam caused over ten thousand dollars in damage to the children‚Äôs park. 14. The basil plant for example needs full sunlight but cilantro grows best in partial sunlight. PrepPros ACT English Course Listing Commas The easiest types of commas on the English Test are listing commas. Listing commas can appear in a multiple item list and between list of multiply adjectives describing the same noun.</p>
</div>

<h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">Commas and Lists</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Listing commas are used to separate the items in a list of 3 or more items.</p>

<div style="background-color: #d1fae5; border-left: 4px solid #10b981; padding: 1rem 1.5rem; margin: 1rem 0; border-radius: 4px;">
  <p style="font-weight: 700; color: #065f46; margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">‚úì Correct</p>
  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0; color: #065f46;">I went to the grocery store to pick up chicken, cheese, and bread.</p>
</div>

<div style="background-color: #d1fae5; border-left: 4px solid #10b981; padding: 1rem 1.5rem; margin: 1rem 0; border-radius: 4px;">
  <p style="font-weight: 700; color: #065f46; margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">‚úì Correct</p>
  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0; color: #065f46;">I went to the grocery store to pick up chicken, cheese and bread.</p>
</div>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The final comma in a list of items is called the Oxford comma. Use of the Oxford comma is stylistic, so</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">technically both lists with and without the Oxford comma are correct. As a result, the Oxford comma</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">alone will never make an answer choice correct or incorrect on the ACT. Most commonly, the ACT</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">includes the Oxford comma like the top example above.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Lists must have 3 or more items to include commas. Be sure that you do not use commas ina list of</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">On more difficult questions, we will need to know when to use commas in lists of adjectives and when</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">commas are not necessary. Take a look at the two correct examples below to learn the difference.</p>

</div>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The rule is a simple one: if you can switch the order of the adjectives without changing the meaning</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">of the sentence, put a comma between the adjectives. If switching the order of the adjectives</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">changes the meaning of the sentence or just makes no sense, there is no comma between the</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">adjectives. In short, if you can switch the adjectives, puta comma. No switch, no comma.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">In the first sentence, the two adjectives ‚Äúdelicious‚Äù and ‚Äústrong‚Äù are separated by</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">acomma. Both of</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">these adjectives describe the coffee on their own. We could switch the adjectives around to ‚Äústrong,</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">delicious coffee‚Äù without changing the meaning. Since we can switch the adjectives, we need a comma.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">In the second sentence, the two adjectives ‚Äúbright‚Äù and ‚Äúfloral‚Äù are not separated by a comma because</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">they build on one another and together modify the noun. If we switch the adjectives to ‚Äúfloral bright</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">furniture,‚Äù the meaning of the sentence is changed. Saying ‚Äúbright floral furniture‚Äù makes senses but</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">saying ‚Äúfloral bright furniture‚Äù does not. Since we cannot switch the adjectives, we do not add a comma.</p>

  <h4 style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 700; margin: 0 0 0.75rem 0; font-size: 1.1rem;">üí° TIP: ‚ÄúThe Switching Trick‚Äù</h4>
  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0; color: #1e3a8a;">When you see multiple adjectives modifying a noun, switch the order of the adjectives to test whether or not you need a comma between the adjectives. Let‚Äôs use these two sentences as examples: The sweet cold ice cream was refreshing after a day at the beach. Elliot had to take off his stainless steel necklace before the swim meet. To test whether these adjectives need a comma between them, switch the order and see if the sentences still make sense. The cold sweet ice cream was refreshing after a day at the beach. Elliot had to take off his steel stainless chain before the swim meet. In the first sentence, switching ‚Äúcold‚Äù and ‚Äúsweet‚Äù does not change the meaning, so we need a comma. In the second sentence, ‚Äústeel stainless chain‚Äù does not work, so we do not need acomma. The correct versions of both sentences are below: Correct: The sweet, cold ice cream was refreshing after a day at the beach. Correct: Elliot had to take off his stainless steel chain before the swim meet. -2?1- PrepPros ACT English Course Adjectives Lists With and Without Commas Practice: Add commas where necessary.

Unnecessary information can appear in the middle of clauses or other unnecessary information, so there can be many more possible sentence structures than the 9 listed on the previous page. However, if you understand the 9 most common sentence structures, you will be very well prepared to deal with even the most difficult sentences on the ACT.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0; color: #1e3a8a;">This brings us to our final sentence structure and commas rule: when a sentence has only one comma in the middle, there must be an <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">independent clause</strong> before or after the comma but not both and not neither. The only exception to this rule is a comma + <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">FANBOYS</strong> linking two independent sentences. If before and after are both independent, we have a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">comma splice</strong>. If neither is independent, we have a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">sentence fragment</strong>. If the first half of the sentence before the comma is independent, the information after the comma must be unnecessary information (rule 2 on the previous page). If the second half of the sentence after the comma is independent, the first half must be unnecessary information (rule 3) or a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">dependent clause</strong> (rule 4). This rule helps you answer some of the most difficult sentence structure/commas questions</p>
