<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Pronouns</strong> are words that stand in for a person, place, or thing. On the ACT, you will need to know how to</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">select the proper <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun</strong> based on case (“he’” vs. “him” or “who” vs. “whom”), make sure that a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun</strong></p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">agrees with the word it is replacing, and spot ambiguous <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronouns</strong>.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">To start, let’s work on <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun</strong> case. <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Pronouns</strong> have two cases: <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong> and object. The <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun</strong>’s role</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">in the sentence (<strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong> or object) dictates which type of <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun</strong> is correct.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">For simple <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun</strong> case questions, it will be easy to tell which <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun</strong> is correct. Just trust your ear!</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">(They/them) went to the street festival on Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">One type of more advanced <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronouns</strong> question occurs when the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun</strong> is in a list. Since we often say</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronouns</strong> in a list incorrectly, we may no longer be able to simply “hear” which <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun</strong> is correct. Fora</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">correct.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The policeman asked to speak to my friends and (me/]).</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">His girlfriend and (he/him) went to the hockey game.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The entire gang and (they/them) are responsible for this.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">At times, <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronouns</strong> are also included in a prepositional <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong>. <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Pronouns</strong> in prepositional <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong></p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">just using your ear.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The bet between Joe and (I/me) was for just five dollars.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">Who vs. Whom</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">You need to know the difference between “who” and “whom,” as it is tested on almost every ACT.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Technically, “who” is the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong> of the sentence, and “whom” is the object. But knowing that is not very</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">helpful. Here’s the trick you need to memorize:</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">If you can replace the word with “he,” “she,” or “they,” use “who.”</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">If you can replace the word with “him,” “her,” or “them,” use “whom.”</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">You may need to rearrange the sentence a bit, but this trick will work for any who vs. whom question.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Try with the examples below:</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">(Who/whom) stole the apple off the teacher’s desk?</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">To (who/whom) should I address this letter?</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">(Who/whom) do you want to the win the Bachelor?</p>

  <h4 style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 700; margin: 0 0 0.75rem 0; font-size: 1.1rem;">💡 TIP: Who vs. Whom in Phrases</h4>
  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0; color: #1e3a8a;">On more difficult questions, who/whom can also be used to introduce a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> describing a person. Using our normal “he/him” trick does not work if we look at the entire sentence. However, if we just look at the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> on its own, the trick still works. The child (who/whom) | invited to the party was very noisy. The child (who/whom) was running down the street was very noisy. If we plug in “he” or “him” to the entire sentence, neither sounds correct. To tell if it is “who” or “whom,” only look at the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong>, which is in the brackets below. The child | (who/whom) I invited to the party| was very noisy. The child | (who/whom) was running down the street| was very noisy. If we just look at the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong>, can we say, “he | invited to the party?” No, but we could say, “I invited him to the party,” so the first one must be “whom.” If we look at the second example, we can say, “he was running down the street,” so “who” is correct. The second trick involves looking at the next word after “who” or “whom.” If the word right after is a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong>, use “who.” If the word right after is a noun, use “whom.” In the first example, “I” is a noun, so we use “whom.” In the second example, “was” is a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong>, so we use “who.” 1. On my way to the farmer’s market, I ran into my childhood best friend, (who/whom) | had not seen in years. 2. I could not believe how much the florists (who/whom) opened up a shop down the street charge for their roses. 3. After the investigation, the owner fired the employee (who/whom) the private investigator identified as the one responsible for stealing over $5,000 of company funds.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0; color: #1e3a8a;">Reflexive <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronouns</strong>, which use the “-self” ending (myself, yourself, himself...), can only be used when the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun</strong> is referring back to a person or thing elsewhere in the sentence or in previous sentences. Incorrect: I grabbed three donuts and put them in a box for me. Correct: I grabbed three donuts and put them in a box for myself. Incorrect: | asked my coworker to put three donuts in a box for myself. Correct: | asked my coworker to put three donuts in a box for me. PrepPros ACT English Course Possessive <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Pronouns</strong> At times, <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronouns</strong> will also be used to show possession. It is important that these <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronouns</strong> still match with the word(s) that are being replaced (we will cover this more on the next page). Possessive Nouns Singular Possessive Adjectives Plural Singular Plural Mine Ours My Our Yours Yours Your Your His/Hers/Its Theirs His/Her/Its Their Incorrect: The entire team went on stage to pick up their trophy. Correct: The entire team went on stage to pick up its trophy. The <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun</strong> here is referring back to “team,” which is singular. In order to match correctly, we must use the singular <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun</strong> “its.” Try with the examples below: Emmanuel and James came back home after forgetting (his/their) phones. Thousands of tourists travel to Egypt each year to see (its/their) ancient pyramids. <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Pronoun</strong> Case Practice: 1.

The restaurant manager asked that an order of spaghetti and meatballs be set aside for (him/himself) after he put some of his favorite cheese on a plate for (him/himself). 4. Inorder to lift the table, my mother asked Eric, Rich, and (me/I) for help. 5. (Who/whom) is the best chess player in the world right now? 6.

Whenever you see a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun</strong> on the ACT, you must find exactly who or what it is referring to. The <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">antecedent</strong> can be in the same sentence as the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun</strong> or in a preceding sentence. The <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">antecedent</strong> can also be anywhere in the sentence (unnecessary information, prepositional <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong>, etc). <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Pronouns</strong> must match the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">antecedent</strong> in terms of plurality and gender. A singular <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">antecedent</strong> must have a singular <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun</strong>; a plural <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">antecedent</strong> must have a plural <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun</strong>.

PrepPros ACT English Course Ambiguous <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Pronouns</strong> For a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun</strong> to be correct, we must know exactly who or what it is referring to. If we do not know exactly who or what a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun</strong> is referring to, the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun</strong> is ambiguous and is always incorrect. Incorrect: Stephen smiled at his father as he threw the ball. We do not know if “he” is referring to Stephen or his father, so “he” is ambiguous and incorrect. Correct: Stephen smiled at his father as his father threw the ball. Even though it may seem redundant, replacing “he” with “his father” fixes the ambiguous <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun</strong> error. Incorrect: Even though the order had not yet shown up, the librarian insisted that she had ordered some. We have no idea what “some” is referring to in this sentence. Correct: Even though the order had not yet shown up, the librarian insisted that she had ordered four copies of the new book.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0; color: #1e3a8a;">Anytime you see a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun</strong> in the answer choices, check to see if the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun</strong> is ambiguous.

NO CHANGE C. one of them. D. some. asked for one. B. aslider. In the first example, the answer is C because we need to specify who is the most famous. “He,” “they,” or “it” could be referring to multiple people or things, so answer choices A, B, and D are all ambiguous. The only answer choice that is specific is C. In the second example, the answer is B since it specifies what James is asking for. If we just say James asked for “one” or “one of them” or “some,” we do not know if James wants a slider or a French fry.
