<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Logical placement questions ask you to place a sentence in the paragraph. These questions are all about</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">context. To find the correct answer, plug the sentence into each potential spot in the answer</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">choices and re-read the paragraph. When checking the placement, make sure that you read the</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">sentence(s) before and after the sentence you are placing. Many students make mistakes by not</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">continuing to read the sentence(s) after where the sentence is being placed. The correct placement</p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0; color: #1e3a8a;">As you are reading the passages, some paragraphs will have bracketed numbers at the beginning of each sentence. On the ACT, it will look just like this: [1] Morgan Freemanâ€™s smooth voice is one of the many things that have made him an A-list celebrity. [2] Everyone has probably tried to do a Morgan Freeman impression, but nobody can match the real thing. [3] Still, that has never stopped me from trying to Bracketed numbers only appear for a logical placement question, so read these paragraphs more carefully. Be aware that the paragraph may currently be out of order, so it may seem confusing when you first read it. Bracketed letters appear when a logical placement question will be at the end of the passage. When reading the passage, you do not need to pay attention to the letters. Just know there will be a question at the end of the passage asking you where to place a sentence.</p>
