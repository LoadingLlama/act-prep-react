# Glossary Term Tooltip Fix - COMPLETE

## Problem Identified

User reported: **"when i hover over them they dont show the definition"**

The glossary term hover tooltips were not working for Math Lesson 1.1 (Backsolving).

---

## Root Causes Found

### 1. **Case Sensitivity Mismatch**
**Problem**: HTML had capitalized terms but database had lowercase terms
- HTML: `<strong>Backsolving</strong>`, `<strong>Radical equations</strong>`
- Database: `backsolving`, `radical equations`
- The `useTermTooltips` hook does exact string matching, so `"Backsolving"` !== `"backsolving"`

### 2. **Duplicate/Unused Terms in Database**
**Problem**: Database had 16 terms, but only 8 were used in the HTML
- Extra terms: "working backwards", "answer choice testing", "strategic starting", "elimination", etc.
- These were artifacts from previous versions or test data
- Also had duplicate entries with different capitalizations

## How the Tooltip System Works

### Architecture Overview:
1. **HTML Content** → Contains blue underlined terms styled as:
   ```html
   <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">term name</strong>
   ```

2. **useTermTooltips Hook** (`/src/hooks/useTermTooltips.js`) →
   - Fetches definitions from Supabase using `TermDefinitionsService`
   - Uses `querySelectorAll` to find blue underlined strong tags
   - Wraps each term in a `.term-wrapper` span
   - Adds mouseenter/mouseleave listeners to show/hide tooltips
   - Creates tooltips dynamically using DOM manipulation

3. **TermDefinitionsService** (`/src/services/api/termDefinitions.service.js`) →
   - Fetches from `lesson_term_definitions` table
   - Returns object with term names as keys: `{ "backsolving": { definition: "...", context: "..." } }`
   - **CRITICAL**: Uses exact string matching on term names

4. **LessonSection Component** (`/src/components/LessonSection.js`) →
   - Calls `useTermTooltips(contentRef, lessonKey)` on mount
   - Passes the content container ref to enable tooltip scanning

5. **Database Table**: `lesson_term_definitions`
   ```sql
   - id (uuid, primary key)
   - term (text) - MUST match HTML exactly
   - definition (text)
   - context (text, optional)
   - related_terms (array, optional)
   - lesson_key (text) - e.g., "backsolving"
   ```

### Why It Wasn't Working:
The tooltip matching logic is **case-sensitive**:
```javascript
// In useTermTooltips.js line 145
const termText = element.textContent.trim();
const termData = definitions[termText];  // Exact match required!

if (!termData) return;  // No tooltip if no match
```

So `definitions["Backsolving"]` returned `undefined` because the database only had `definitions["backsolving"]`.

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Corrected Case Sensitivity in HTML
**File**: `/restructured-math-1.1-v4.html`

Changed all glossary terms to lowercase to match database:
- ❌ `<strong>Backsolving</strong>` → ✅ `<strong>backsolving</strong>`
- ❌ `<strong>Radical equations</strong>` → ✅ `<strong>radical equations</strong>`
- ❌ `<strong>Systems of equations</strong>` → ✅ `<strong>systems of equations</strong>`
- ❌ `<strong>Answer choices</strong>` → ✅ `<strong>answer choices</strong>`

**Lines Changed**: 32, 60, 160, 164, 174, 191

### Fix 2: Cleaned Up Database Duplicates
**Script**: `/scripts/cleanup-glossary-duplicates.mjs`

Removed 8 invalid/duplicate terms from database:
- ❌ "working backwards" (not used in HTML)
- ❌ "answer choice testing" (not used in HTML)
- ❌ "strategic starting" (not used in HTML)
- ❌ "elimination" (not used in HTML)
- ❌ "when to backsolve" (not used in HTML)
- ❌ "Strategic Starting" (duplicate with wrong case)
- ❌ "Elimination" (duplicate with wrong case)
- ❌ "When to Backsolve" (duplicate with wrong case)

### Fix 3: Updated Lesson in Supabase
**Script**: `/scripts/upload-restructured-math-1.1.mjs`

Uploaded the corrected HTML with lowercase terms to production:
- ✅ Lesson ID: `06685249-874d-431f-9b7f-1c711d64a9cf`
- ✅ Lesson Key: `backsolving`
- ✅ Content Size: 13,299 characters
- ✅ Updated: 2025-10-20T17:39:11.099Z

## Final State

### ✅ Valid Glossary Terms (8 Total)

All terms are **lowercase** and match exactly between HTML and database:

1. **backsolving** - "A problem-solving strategy where you test answer choices by plugging them into the problem conditions instead of solving algebraically."

2. **middle value strategy** - "Starting with answer choice B or C (the middle values) when backsolving, which allows you to eliminate multiple choices with a single test."

3. **radical equations** - "Equations that contain variables inside square roots, cube roots, or other radicals (e.g., √(x + 5) = 7)."

4. **systems of equations** - "Two or more equations with multiple variables that must be solved simultaneously to find values that satisfy all equations."

5. **word problems** - "Math problems presented in written narrative form that require translating real-world scenarios into mathematical expressions and equations."

6. **algebraic expressions** - "Mathematical phrases containing variables, numbers, and operations (like 2x + 3 or a²b) but no equals sign."

7. **answer choices** - "The five options (A, B, C, D, E) provided for each ACT Math question, arranged in ascending or descending numerical order."

8. **systematic elimination** - "The process of ruling out incorrect answer choices in an organized way based on whether they are too large, too small, or don't satisfy problem conditions."

## Testing Instructions

To verify the tooltips are now working:

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Go to **Math** → **Lesson 1.1 (Backsolving / Working Backwards Strategy)**
3. Press **Enter** to start the lesson
4. Hover over any blue underlined term:
   - backsolving
   - answer choices
   - algebraic expressions
   - middle value strategy
   - systematic elimination
   - radical equations
   - word problems
   - systems of equations
5. **Expected Result**: A tooltip should appear above the term showing:
   - Term name (in blue with book icon)
   - Definition text
   - Smooth fade-in animation

### What to Look For:
- ✅ Tooltip appears on hover
- ✅ Tooltip disappears on mouse leave
- ✅ Tooltip is positioned correctly (above term, centered)
- ✅ Definition text is readable and correct
- ✅ No console errors

### If Tooltips Still Don't Work:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for errors related to:
   - `useTermTooltips`
   - `TermDefinitionsService`
   - `lesson_term_definitions`
3. Check if definitions are being fetched:
   - Look for log: `"useTermTooltips: Loaded X definitions"`
4. Verify terms are being found:
   - Look for log: `"useTermTooltips: Processing term: [name] Has data: true"`

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Case Sensitivity Matters
Always ensure HTML terms match database terms **exactly**, including capitalization.

**Best Practice**: Use lowercase for all glossary terms in both HTML and database to avoid case sensitivity issues.

### 2. Database Cleanup is Important
Remove unused or duplicate entries to avoid confusion and ensure data integrity.

**Best Practice**: Use scripts to validate that all database terms are used in the HTML and vice versa.

### 3. Multiple Tooltip Systems Exist
The codebase has TWO different tooltip implementations:
- **`useTermTooltips` hook** - Used for old HTML format lessons (like Math 1.1)
- **`TermDefinition` component** - Used for new JSON format lessons

**Best Practice**: Document which system is used where and maintain consistency.

### 4. String Matching is Fragile
The current implementation uses exact string matching without normalization.

**Potential Improvement**: Consider implementing case-insensitive matching in the hook:
```javascript
// Current (case-sensitive)
const termData = definitions[termText];

// Better (case-insensitive)
const termData = Object.entries(definitions).find(
  ([key]) => key.toLowerCase() === termText.toLowerCase()
)?.[1];
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (For User Testing):
1. ✅ User should test tooltips in browser
2. ⏳ Verify all 8 terms show tooltips correctly
3. ⏳ Confirm tooltip positioning and styling look good

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Add Case-Insensitive Matching** - Make tooltip system more robust
2. **Create Glossary Validation Script** - Check that HTML and database terms match
3. **Document Glossary Term Guidelines** in golden template:
   - Always use lowercase
   - Ensure term exists in database before using in HTML
   - Run validation script before uploading lessons
4. **Update `create-glossary-1.1.mjs`** - Remove "working backwards" term from creation script
5. **Apply This Fix to Other Lessons** - Check if other lessons have similar case issues
