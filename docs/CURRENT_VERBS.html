<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Chapter 4: <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Verbs</strong></p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Verbs</strong> questions test you on two major topics - <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong>-<strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong> agreement and <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong> tense. The <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong>-</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong> agreement questions are trickier, as at times it can be difficult to find the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong> and ‚Äúhear‚Äù which</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong> is correct. You will learn a few methods in this chapter to correctly answer these questions. For</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong> tense questions, the approach is much more straightforward: read for context and go with the</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">answer that sounds correct.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Subject</strong>-<strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Verb</strong> Agreement</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Whenever you see a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verbs</strong> question on the ACT, your first job is to find the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong>. The <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong>, which</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">is the person, place, or thing doing the action, is usually at the beginning of the sentence.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong> of the sentence must agree with the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong>. If the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong> is singular, the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong> must be</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">singular, and if the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong> is plural, the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong> must be plural. In simple sentences when the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong> and</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verbs</strong> are right next to each other, it will be easy to select the right <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong>:</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Cats (loves/love) to sit in empty boxes.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">My dog (barks/bark) at the mailman every day.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Easy right? Unfortunately, <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verbs</strong> questions will not be this easy on test day. The ACT increases the</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">difficulty by putting distance between the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong> and the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong>. The farther away the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong> is from the</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong>, the more likely we are to say the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong> incorrectly. Remember, what sounds right is not always</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">right. You cannot trust your ear on <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong>-<strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong> agreement questions.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">There are 3 ways the ACT will try to trick you on <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong>-<strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong> agreement:</p>

  <h4 style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 700; margin: 0 0 0.75rem 0; font-size: 1.1rem;">üí° TIP: Read the Subject and Verbs Side-by-side</h4>
  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0; color: #1e3a8a;">Once you find the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong> and <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong>, read them next to each other and ignore the information in between. This will help you more easily identify which one is correct. A large percentage of the voters, many of whom are under the age of 30, (prefer/prefers) the new housing proposal. Cross out any unnecessary information and prepositional <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong>.

  <h4 style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 700; margin: 0 0 0.75rem 0; font-size: 1.1rem;">üí° TIP: Plug in ‚Äúhe/she/it‚Äù for singular subject and ‚Äúthey‚Äù for plural subjects</h4>
  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0; color: #1e3a8a;">Sometimes it is difficult to ‚Äúhear‚Äù which <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong> correctly matches with the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong>. For singular words, plug in ‚Äúhe,‚Äù ‚Äúshe,‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äù for the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong>. For plural words, plug in ‚Äúthey‚Äù for the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong>. With this trick, we will be able to easily hear which <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong> properly agrees with the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong>. The exact time for the meeting with the softball coach and location for the showcase (has/have) not been finalized. If we read the sentence as is, it is difficult to tell which <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong> fits. After crossing out the prepositional <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong>, the sentence looks like this: The exact time forthe meeting seftball with the eeach and location fertheshewease (has/have) not been finalized. The <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subjects</strong> are ‚Äútime‚Äù and ‚Äúlocation,‚Äù so the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong> is plural. Replace the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subjects</strong> with ‚Äúthey.‚Äù They (has/have) not been finalized. Now it‚Äôs easy...we can tell that ‚Äúhave‚Äù is correct. Try this tip with the examples below: 1. 2. Each of the runners who complete the marathon (wins/win) a medal. The complex designs and intricate needlework (makes/make) Julia‚Äôs carpets the most popular in the entire art market. - 45 - PrepPros ACT English Course <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Subject</strong>-<strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Verb</strong> Agreement Practice: 1.

Ned, the winner of the gold medal in the 200-meter breaststroke, and Claire, the bronze medal winner in the 1000-meter freestyle, (was/were) featured on the cover of the swimming magazine. 4. Gold coins and silver bars, all once thought to be lost forever, (was/were) found in the sunken pirate ship. 5. Each of the girl scouts (sells/sell) delicious Thin Mint cookies. 6.

Freediving, a very unique and uncommon sport, (require/requires) divers to hold their breath for long periods of time. - 46 - PrepPros ACT English Course <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Verb</strong> Tense For questions on <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong> tense, trust your ear. As a native English speaker, you will know what sounds right or wrong in the sentence as long as you read for context. To find which tense is correct, read the previous sentence(s) and look for other <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verbs</strong>. Make sure to match the tense in the rest of the paragraph. On the ACT, do not pick a complicated tense (has run, had ran, had been running, would have run, etc.) when a simple tense works. Last year, Margot (designs/designed/will design) a new line of summer dresses. Before he votes tomorrow, Dale (researches/research/will research) each candidate‚Äôs positions on the major issues. The referee stopped the fight after the boxers (refuses/refused /will refuse) to follow the rules. In English, we use the perfect tense when there are multiple timelines in a sentence. The perfect tense is when we say ‚Äúhas‚Äù or ‚Äúhave‚Äù or ‚Äúhad‚Äù with the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong>. If you read for context and read the entire sentence, we should be able to ‚Äúhear‚Äù when we need to use the perfect tense. Many surfers enjoy paddling out, but few (rode/have ridden) waves over ten feet tall. While the group of entrepreneurs claimed to all be successful, only a few (will start/have started) their own businesses. The bison (ate/had been eating) when the lions began their attack. By the beginning of next year, the doctors (finish/finished/will have finished) their preliminary research on lung cancer. The conditional tense describes what would or could happen in the future. The kind of <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong> conjugation that we need depends on how likely the outcome is to actually happen (probable, improbable, impossible). Again, the Key here is to trust your ear and go with what sounds right to you. If|make the free throw, we (will win/would win/would have won) the game. IfImade the free throw, we (will win/would win/would have won) the game. If|had made the free throw, we (will win/would win/would have won) the game. The ACT also tests you on irregular <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verbs</strong>. For these <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verbs</strong>, just trust your ear and go with what sounds correct to you. Before the show (began/begun), the lights were dimmed. The deliveryman had (rang/rung) the doorbell before dropping off the package. By the time the meal was over, the boy had (ate/eaten) an entire bag of popcorn and had (drank/drunk) a liter of cola. PrepPros ACT English Course</p>

We use these <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verbs</strong> incorrectly all of the time, so using your ear and trying to hear which one sounds correct is difficult. All you need to do is remember the simple rules below: With ‚Äúhas,‚Äù ‚Äúhave,‚Äù or ‚Äúhad‚Äù ===> Use the ‚Äúu‚Äù version (perfect tense) Correct: Before you arrived, I had swum some laps. With no ‚Äúhas,‚Äù ‚Äúhave,‚Äù or ‚Äúhad‚Äù c=" Use the‚Äúa‚Äù version (past tense) Correct: I swam some laps this morning.

  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0; color: #1e3a8a;">Spotting <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verbs</strong> questions in general is pretty easy: the answer choices will have different forms of the same <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong>. Knowing we are dealing with a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verbs</strong> question is a good start, but to answer the question correctly we need to know if we are being tested on <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong>-<strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong> agreement or <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong> tense. <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Subject</strong>-<strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong> agreement questions always have one defining characteristic: 1. <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Verbs</strong> in the answer choices have singular and plural versions. Look for ‚Äúis‚Äù vs. ‚Äúare,‚Äù ‚Äúhas‚Äù vs. ‚Äúhave,‚Äù ‚Äúwas‚Äù vs. ‚Äúwere,‚Äù and any other <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verbs</strong> with a singular, like ‚Äúruns,‚Äù vs. a plural, like ‚Äúrun.‚Äù Anytime you see <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verbs</strong> that have a singular and plural version in the answer choices, the question is testing you on <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong>-<strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong> agreement. The addition of solar panels to the roof of a house in Nevada make the house 1. Which choice makes the sentence most grammatically acceptable: ? A. NO CHANGE on average 20% more energy efficient. B. makes C. have made D. were making In this example, B is correct because the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong> ‚Äúaddition‚Äù is singular. The only <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong> that matches with ‚Äúaddition‚Äù is ‚Äúmakes.‚Äù Even though there are different tenses in the answer choices, we only need to use <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong>-<strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong> agreement to find the correct answer. <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Verb</strong> tense questions always have two defining characteristics: 1. <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Verbs</strong> in the answer choices are in different tenses. For example, if ‚Äúrequires,‚Äù ‚Äúrequired,‚Äù and ‚Äúwill require‚Äù are in the answer choices, the question is testing you on tense. 2. <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Verbs</strong> in the answer choices do NOT have singular and plural versions. If there are not options for singular and plural versions, <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong>-<strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong> agreement is not being tested. The girl scouts are hosting a bake sale 2. Which choice makes the sentence tomorrow to raise money. To get ready, most grammatically acceptable:? Adya would need to bake two trays of A. NO CHANGE C. needed D. needs ; blondies and a box of donut holes. B. was needing In this example, D is correct because the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong> must be present tense. In the previous sentence, the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong> ‚Äúare‚Äù is present tense, so we know this sentence should also be in present tense.
