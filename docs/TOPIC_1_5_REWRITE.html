<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Understanding <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">pronouns</strong> is one of the most essential skills for success on the ACT English Test. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Pronouns</strong> are words that replace nouns to avoid repetition and create clearer, more concise sentences. The ACT tests three critical aspects of pronoun usage: selecting the correct <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun case</strong> (subject versus object forms), ensuring <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun-antecedent agreement</strong> in number and gender, and identifying ambiguous pronouns that lack clear references. Mastering these rules will help you quickly spot errors and confidently select correct answers on test day.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">1. What are the key pronoun rules?</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The ACT tests three main pronoun concepts that appear repeatedly on every test. Understanding these fundamental rules is crucial for identifying and correcting pronoun errors efficiently.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Pronoun case</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Pronoun case</strong> refers to the form a pronoun takes based on its role in a sentence. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Subject pronouns</strong> perform the action of the sentence, while <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">object pronouns</strong> receive the action or follow prepositions. Choosing the wrong case is one of the most common errors on the ACT.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Here are the subject and object pronouns you need to know:</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Subject pronouns</strong>: I, you, he, she, it, we, they, who</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Object pronouns</strong>: me, you, him, her, it, us, them, whom</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">For straightforward questions, your ear will guide you to the correct answer. However, the ACT makes questions harder by placing pronouns in lists or prepositional phrases where our natural speech patterns often mislead us.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Pronoun-antecedent agreement</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">An <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">antecedent</strong> is the noun that a pronoun replaces. Every pronoun must agree with its <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">antecedent</strong> in both number (singular or plural) and gender (masculine, feminine, or neutral). This agreement rule applies even when the antecedent appears in a previous sentence or is separated by modifying phrases.</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Key rule 1: Singular antecedents require singular pronouns</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Key rule 2: Plural antecedents require plural pronouns</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Key rule 3: Collective nouns (team, committee, family) are typically singular</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Pronoun clarity</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">An <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ambiguous pronoun</strong> is a pronoun that lacks a clear, specific reference. When a pronoun could refer to multiple nouns, or when its reference is unclear, it creates ambiguity and is always incorrect on the ACT. The solution is to replace the ambiguous pronoun with the specific noun it represents.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Common ambiguous pronouns to watch for include: it, they, them, this, that, these, those, he, she, him, her, some, and one.</p>

<h4 style="margin: 0 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 0.75rem; border-left: 4px solid #b91c1c; color: #000000; font-weight: 700;">Example 1: Basic pronoun case</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">My sister and I always compete against each other when we play board games. Yesterday, our parents bought a new strategy game for my sister and I to try. When the package arrived, my mother handed the box to my sister and me, and we immediately opened it to read the rules.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Which of the following alternatives to the underlined portion would NOT be acceptable?</p>

<p style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">A. for my sister and me</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">B. for myself and my sister</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">C. for us</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">D. for my sister and myself</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">E. NO CHANGE</span>
</p>

<p style="margin: 1.5rem 0 0.75rem 0;"><strong>Solution:</strong></p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">The pronoun follows the preposition "for," which means we need an <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">object pronoun</strong></li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">To test pronoun case in a list, remove the other items: "for I" versus "for me"</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">"For I" sounds incorrect because "I" is a subject pronoun, not an object pronoun</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Choice A ("for my sister and me") correctly uses the object pronoun "me"</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Choice B ("for myself and my sister") incorrectly uses the reflexive pronoun when the subject is "our parents," not "I"</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Choice C ("for us") correctly uses the object pronoun "us"</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Choice D ("for my sister and myself") also incorrectly uses the reflexive pronoun</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">The original uses "I" after a preposition, which requires an object pronoun</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Answer: E</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">2. Advanced pronoun techniques</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Once you understand the basic pronoun rules, the ACT increases difficulty by testing these concepts in more complex contexts. Follow these advanced techniques to handle even the trickiest pronoun questions.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">The who versus whom test</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The distinction between <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">who</strong> and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">whom</strong> appears on nearly every ACT. While technically "who" functions as a subject and "whom" as an object, this explanation is not particularly helpful for quick problem-solving. Instead, use this reliable substitution test:</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">If you can replace the word with "he," "she," or "they," use "who"</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">If you can replace the word with "him," "her," or "them," use "whom"</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">You may need to mentally rearrange the sentence for this test to work</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Example: "To (who/whom) should I address this letter?" Rearrange to: "I should address this letter to (he/him)." Since "him" is correct, use "whom."</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Who versus whom in descriptive phrases</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Harder questions use "who" or "whom" to introduce a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> that describes a person. The he/him substitution trick still works, but you must isolate the descriptive phrase instead of looking at the entire sentence.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Example: "The athlete (who/whom) I interviewed yesterday was very friendly." The phrase is "(who/whom) I interviewed yesterday." Test it: "I interviewed he" or "I interviewed him"? Since "him" works, use "whom."</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Quick shortcut: Look at the word immediately after "who/whom." If it is a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong>, use "who." If it is a noun or pronoun, use "whom."</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Reflexive pronouns</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Reflexive pronouns</strong> (myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves) can only be used when the pronoun refers back to a noun or pronoun that appears earlier in the same sentence. They cannot stand alone or refer to someone mentioned in a different sentence.</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Correct: "I made myself a sandwich." (refers back to "I")</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Incorrect: "Please give the report to John and myself." (no reference to "I" in this sentence)</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Correct: "Please give the report to John and me."</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Possessive pronouns and collective nouns</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Possessive pronouns</strong> (my, your, his, her, its, our, their) must agree in number with their antecedents. Collective nouns like "team," "committee," "family," "government," and "company" are grammatically singular, even though they represent groups of people. This means they require singular pronouns.</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Incorrect: "The team celebrated their victory."</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Correct: "The team celebrated its victory."</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Incorrect: "The government announced their new policy."</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Correct: "The government announced its new policy."</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Compound antecedents</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">When antecedents are joined by "and," they require a plural pronoun. When joined by "or" or "nor," the pronoun must agree with the nearest antecedent.</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Correct: "Sarah and Michael brought their lunches." (joined by "and" = plural)</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Correct: "Either Sarah or Michael will bring his or her lunch." (joined by "or" = nearest antecedent)</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Correct: "Neither the students nor the teacher remembered his lesson plan." (agrees with "teacher")</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin: 0 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 0.75rem; border-left: 4px solid #b91c1c; color: #000000; font-weight: 700;">Example 2: Pronoun-antecedent agreement</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The local history museum recently expanded its collection of artifacts from the colonial period. Each visitor to the new exhibit receives a guidebook at the entrance so they can learn about the historical significance of the displayed items. The museum director, who organized the exhibit, spent three years gathering materials for it. Museum staff members say that the exhibit has exceeded their expectations for attendance, with thousands of people visiting during the first month alone.</p>

<p style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">A. NO CHANGE</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">B. so that he or she can learn</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">C. so that one can learn</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">D. so they can learn</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">E. so the visitor can learn</span>
</p>

<p style="margin: 1.5rem 0 0.75rem 0;"><strong>Solution:</strong></p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Identify the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">antecedent</strong>: "Each visitor" is singular</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">The word "each" is a singular indefinite pronoun that always requires a singular verb and singular pronoun</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Choice A uses "they," which is plural and does not agree with the singular "each visitor"</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Choice B correctly uses "he or she," which is singular and matches "each visitor"</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Choice C uses "one," which creates an inconsistent point of view (switches from "visitor" to "one")</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Choice D drops "that" but still uses the incorrect plural "they"</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Choice E avoids pronouns altogether by repeating "the visitor," which is grammatically correct but less concise than choice B</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">While both B and E are technically correct, B is the best choice because it maintains conciseness while fixing the agreement error</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Answer: B</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">3. Common pronoun mistakes</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The ACT designs pronoun questions to exploit common errors in everyday speech. Recognizing these frequent mistakes will help you avoid them on test day and improve your accuracy on pronoun questions.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Pronouns in lists</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">When a pronoun appears in a list with other nouns or pronouns, students often choose the wrong case because the construction "sounds right" in casual conversation. The error typically involves using subject pronouns where object pronouns are needed, particularly with "I" versus "me."</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Common error: "The teacher gave extra credit to Maria and I."</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Test by removing the list: "The teacher gave extra credit to I" (clearly wrong)</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Correct: "The teacher gave extra credit to Maria and me."</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Ambiguous pronoun references</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">An <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ambiguous pronoun</strong> occurs when a pronoun could logically refer to more than one noun. This error is always incorrect on the ACT, even if context makes the intended meaning clear. The solution is to replace the pronoun with the specific noun or to rearrange the sentence.</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Common error: "When the chef spoke to the waiter, he seemed frustrated." (Who was frustrated?)</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Correct: "When the chef spoke to the waiter, the chef seemed frustrated."</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Common error: "The restaurant added more tables, but this caused problems." (What is "this"?)</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Correct: "The restaurant added more tables, but this expansion caused problems."</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Vague pronouns like "it," "this," and "that"</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Vague pronouns refer to entire ideas, clauses, or situations rather than specific nouns. These pronouns are technically ambiguous and should be replaced with specific nouns or noun phrases that clarify the reference.</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Watch for "it," "this," "that," "which," and "these" used vaguely</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Common error: "The company increased prices, which upset customers." (What upset them—the increase or the act of increasing?)</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Better: "The company increased prices, a decision that upset customers."</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Pronoun agreement with indefinite pronouns</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Indefinite pronouns like "everyone," "everybody," "anyone," "someone," "each," "either," "neither," and "none" are grammatically singular and require singular pronouns. This contradicts common usage in everyday speech, where people often use "they" with these words.</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Common error: "Everyone should bring their own lunch."</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Correct: "Everyone should bring his or her own lunch."</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Common error: "Each of the players have their own locker."</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Correct: "Each of the players has his or her own locker."</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Its versus it's confusion</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">While this is technically a possessive error rather than a pronoun case error, "its" versus "it's" appears frequently on the ACT. Remember that <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">possessive pronouns</strong> never use apostrophes.</p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">"Its" (no apostrophe) is the possessive form: "The dog wagged its tail."</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">"It's" (with apostrophe) is a contraction meaning "it is" or "it has"</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Quick test: If you can replace the word with "it is" or "it has," use "it's"</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin: 0 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 0.75rem; border-left: 4px solid #b91c1c; color: #000000; font-weight: 700;">Example 3: Ambiguous pronouns</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">When the technology company's CEO met with the chief financial officer to discuss quarterly earnings, he expressed concern about rising operational costs. The company had invested heavily in new software development, but these investments had not yet generated significant revenue. Despite the financial challenges, the board of directors remained confident that it would improve in the coming quarters. However, some shareholders questioned whether they should continue supporting such an aggressive expansion strategy.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Which of the following alternatives to the underlined portion would be LEAST acceptable?</p>

<p style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">A. the board of directors remained confident that financial performance</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">B. the board of directors remained confident that the situation</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">C. the board of directors remained confident that revenue</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">D. the board of directors remained confident that this</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">E. NO CHANGE</span>
</p>

<p style="margin: 1.5rem 0 0.75rem 0;"><strong>Solution:</strong></p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">The original sentence uses "it," which is an <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ambiguous pronoun</strong></li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">What does "it" refer to? The company? The financial challenges? The investments? The revenue? The situation is unclear</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">On "LEAST acceptable" questions, we need to find the answer choice that is grammatically incorrect or unclear</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Choice A replaces "it" with "financial performance," which is specific and clear</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Choice B replaces "it" with "the situation," which clearly refers to the financial challenges discussed</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Choice C replaces "it" with "revenue," which specifically references the lack of revenue mentioned earlier</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Choice D replaces "it" with "this," which is still vague and ambiguous (What is "this"?)</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Choice D commits the same error as the original by using a vague, ambiguous pronoun</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Since both the original (Choice E) and Choice D are ambiguous, we must choose which is LEAST acceptable</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Choice D is LEAST acceptable because "this" is even more vague than "it" in this context</li>
</ul>
