## Database Structure

All lessons follow this structure:
- `lesson_metadata` table - Lesson info (title, category, difficulty, duration)
- `lesson_sections` table - Sections within lesson (main content)
- `section_content` table - HTML content blocks

### Content Format

Each lesson uses the proven format from lessons 1.1 and 1.2:
- Introduction paragraph with ACT relevance
- Key concept sections with headers
- Interactive examples with proper HTML formatting
- Examples use `<h4>` headers with red border-left styling
- Answer choices in Times New Roman with `<br>` tags
- Solutions formatted as bulleted lists
- Key Takeaways section with green checkmarks

### Interactive Examples

Examples are automatically made interactive by the `splitIntoTextSections` utility when they:
1. Contain `<h4>` header with "Example" text
2. Have answer choices in `<span>` tags
3. Include a `<strong>Solution:</strong>` section
4. Have `Answer: [letter]` at the end

The `InteractiveExample.js` component handles:
- Clickable answer choices (A-K supported)
- Visual feedback on selection
- Solution reveal after clicking
- Proper HTML rendering (including `<em>`, `<sup>`, etc.)

## Scripts Created

1. **consolidate-1-2-content.mjs** - Fixed lesson 1.2 structure
2. **generate-lesson-2-2.mjs** - Generated lesson 2.2 with full content
3. **generate-all-31-lessons-full.mjs** - Updated all remaining lessons
4. **check-existing-lessons.mjs** - Database inspection tool

## Next Steps

To enhance lessons with more comprehensive content:

1. **Add more examples** - Each lesson should have 3-5 worked examples
2. **Expand teaching sections** - Add more detailed explanations
3. **Add practice problems** - 3-5 problems before quiz
4. **Create quizzes** - 10-question Mastery Check for each lesson
5. **Add tip boxes** - ACT strategy tips throughout

## Format Compliance

All lessons comply with the style guide from lessons 1.1 and 1.2:

✅ Proper HTML/CSS styling
✅ Consistent header hierarchy
✅ Examples with interactive format
✅ Key Takeaways section
✅ ACT-relevant content
✅ Times New Roman for answer choices
✅ Proper mathematical notation (`<em>`, `<sup>`, `<sub>`)
