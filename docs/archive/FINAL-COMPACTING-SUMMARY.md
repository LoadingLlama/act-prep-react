# Final Compacting Summary - Lesson 2.1

## ✨ Complete Overhaul - All Issues Fixed

### What Was Actually Wrong
- **Diagrams were shrunk** but text/fonts were NOT reduced
- **Answer choices** were too large
- **Quiz questions** had too much spacing
- **Everything felt cramped** because only diagrams changed, not content

### What I Fixed This Time

## 📐 Diagrams - KEPT Small (Perfect Size)
- ✅ Intersecting lines: **300x180** (down from 400x240)
- ✅ Parallel lines: **380x255** (down from 500x340)
- ✅ These sizes are perfect - not changing them
