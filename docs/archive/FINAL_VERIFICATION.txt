    - References specific text/numbers
    - Explains exact reasoning
    - Identifies grammatical concepts

[✓] SECTION 2: Why each wrong answer is wrong
    - Addresses every incorrect choice
    - Explains specific error
    - References exact issue

[✓] HTML FORMAT: Properly structured with styling

SAMPLE QUALITY (Question #1)
-----------------------------
BEFORE: "provides the most grammatically sound phrasing"
AFTER:  "uses 'Of the thousands' to create a dependent prepositional 
         phrase that eliminates the comma splice error in the original 
         sentence. The original reads 'There are thousands of new animal 
         species identified each year, the vast majority are small' which 
         incorrectly joins two independent clauses with only a comma."

✓ All wrong answers addressed
