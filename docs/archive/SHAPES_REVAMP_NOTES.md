# Shapes & Triangles Lesson - Revamp Notes

## Current State Analysis

**Lesson:** Geometry: Shapes & Triangles
**Lesson Key:** `geometry-shapes`
**ID:** `13406013-6a46-48a6-992b-20489198a17b`

### Issues Found

1. **Typography:**
   - Font size: 0.9rem → needs to be 16px
   - Line heights: 2 → needs to be 1.5-1.7
   - Margins need adjustment

2. **Key Terms:**
   - Only 1 blue underlined term (radius)
   - Needs 10-15 terms with definitions

3. **Examples (5 total):**
   - Example 1: Rectangle perimeter/area calculation
   - Example 2: Square perimeter/area calculation
   - Example 3: Triangle area calculation
   - Example 4: Circle circumference/area calculation
   - Example 5: Trapezoid area calculation

   **All need conversion to interactive format:**
   - Red left border (4px solid #b91c1c)
   - 19px problem text with answer choices (A-E)
   - Solution in bullets
   - "Answer: X" at end

4. **Key Takeaways:**
   - Has green box format
   - Needs standard format with checkmarks

### Terms to Add Blue Underlines

1. **perimeter** - The distance around the outside of a shape
2. **area** - The amount of space inside a shape
3. **rectangle** - Four-sided shape with opposite sides equal
4. **square** - Special rectangle where all four sides are equal
5. **triangle** - Three-sided polygon
6. **circle** - Round shape with all points equidistant from center
7. **radius** - Distance from center of circle to edge
8. **diameter** - Distance across circle through center (2 × radius)
9. **circumference** - Distance around a circle (circle's perimeter)
10. **trapezoid** - Four-sided shape with exactly two parallel sides
11. **base** - Bottom side of a shape, used in area calculations
12. **height** - Perpendicular distance from base to opposite vertex
13. **perpendicular** - At a 90-degree angle

### Examples to Convert

Each example needs to become a quiz-style problem with:
- Clear problem statement (19px)
- 5 answer choices (A-E)
- Step-by-step solution
- Correct answer indicated

I'll create strategic quiz questions that test understanding, not just plug-and-chug.

### Quiz Questions (5-7 total)

1. **Rectangle perimeter** - Given length and width
2. **Square area** - Given perimeter, find area
3. **Triangle area** - Identifying perpendicular height
4. **Circle area** - Given diameter (must divide by 2 for radius)
5. **Trapezoid area** - Standard calculation
6. **Mixed shapes** - Compare areas of different shapes
7. **Application problem** - Real-world scenario

## Action Plan

Due to the length of this lesson (14,598 characters), I'll need to:

1. Create complete new content with all fixes applied
2. Add 13 term definitions to Supabase
3. Create 7-question quiz
4. Update lesson in Supabase
5. Test thoroughly

**Estimated time:** ~1 hour for complete revamp

This will serve as the template for other geometry lessons.
