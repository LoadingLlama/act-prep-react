   - [ ] Quiz title: "Practice What You've Learned"

3. **Answer Each Quiz Question**
   - [ ] Question 1: Has intersecting lines diagram with 40° and ?
   - [ ] Question 2: Has intersecting lines diagram with 75° and ?
   - [ ] Question 3: Has parallel lines diagram with 50° and x°
   - [ ] Question 4: Has parallel lines diagram with 65° and y°
   - [ ] Question 5: Has intersecting lines diagram with 3x° and (x+80)°
   - [ ] All diagrams use serif font (Times New Roman)

## 🔧 Maintenance Notes

### Adding More Practice Questions

To add more ACT-authentic questions in the future:

```javascript
import { generateACTParallelLinesProblem } from './generators/parallel-lines-generator.mjs';

// For parallel lines questions
const problem = generateACTParallelLinesProblem({
  acuteAngle: 55,
  questionType: 'supplementary', // or 'corresponding', 'alternate_interior', etc.
  flipTransversal: false
});

// Use problem.svg for diagram
// Use problem.question for question text
// Use problem.answer for correct answer
// Use problem.explanation for solution explanation
```

### Diagram Types Available

1. **Parallel Lines + Transversal:** Use `generateParallelLinesDiagram(angle, variable)`
2. **Intersecting Lines (Vertical):** Use `generateIntersectingLinesDiagram(angle, false)`
3. **Intersecting Lines (Adjacent):** Use `generateIntersectingLinesDiagram(angle, true)`
4. **Algebraic:** Use `generateAlgebraicDiagram()`

All functions are in `/Users/cadenchiang/Desktop/act-prep-react/fix-all-lesson-2-1.mjs`

## ✨ Summary

**Before:**
- Example 3 had non-ACT style diagram (colored, wrong font, L₁/L₂ labels)
- 3 duplicate quizzes causing confusion
- 5 quiz questions with NO diagrams

**After:**
- Example 3 has perfect ACT-authentic diagram
- 1 clean quiz (duplicates removed)
- 5 quiz questions each with ACT-authentic diagrams matching the exact style of real ACT problems

**Impact:**
Students now see diagrams that match EXACTLY what they'll encounter on the actual ACT exam!
