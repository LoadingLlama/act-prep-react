## Sample Formatted HTML

### Substitution Lesson (Beginning)

```html
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
  Do you prefer working with numbers or variables? Most students find working
  with numbers much easier! On the ACT, some questions have many unknown
  variables and few or no numbers at all. Students often find these questions
  more difficult. With substitution, we can substitute simple numbers for
  variables and solve the question using numbers instead of relying on complex
  algebra with variables.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
  1. What Is Substitution?
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
  Substitution is a strategy where you pick simple numbers to replace variables
  in a problem, making it easier to work through the math. Instead of solving
  with abstract algebra, you test with concrete numbers.
</p>
```

### Geometry Angles Lesson (Beginning)

```html
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
  In this chapter, we will cover all the rules you need to know for angles
  questions on the ACT. For angles questions, put your pencil to work by
  finding and labeling unknown angles. The more angles you label, the easier
  it will be to find the
  <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">angle</strong>
  you need to know to answer the question.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
  1. Intersecting Lines
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">
    <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Vertical angles</strong>
    are equal
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">
    <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Adjacent angles</strong>
    are supplementary (x and y add to 180°)
  </li>
</ul>
```

## Term Highlighting Implementation

### Terms Highlighted in Substitution
- number substitution (1 instance)
- percent problems (1 instance in context)

### Terms Highlighted in Geometry Angles
- angle (14 instances)
- vertex
- Acute Angles
- Right Angles
- Obtuse Angles
- Straight Angles
- Complementary Angles
- Supplementary Angles
- Vertical Angles
- Adjacent Angles

All term highlighting is case-insensitive and only applied where appropriate (excluding headers and Key Takeaways).
