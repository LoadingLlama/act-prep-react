CONCLUSION
================================================================================

OVERALL ASSESSMENT: NEEDS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT

Current State:
- Content exists and covers correct topics
- Basic explanations are accurate
- Structure is logical
- Some examples are present

Critical Deficiencies:
- ZERO quizzes (0/6 lessons)
- NO diagrams in geometry lessons (fundamental flaw)
- Minimal visual content overall
- Content too short
- Insufficient examples
- No practice problems

Impact on Students:
- Cannot assess their understanding (no quizzes)
- Geometry learning severely hampered (no visuals)
- Limited practice opportunities
- May struggle on actual ACT

Estimated Development Needed:
- Quizzes: 40-60 hours (creating questions + diagrams)
- Diagrams: 60-80 hours (creating 30-40 quality diagrams/graphs)
- Content expansion: 30-40 hours (doubling content length)
- Examples: 20-30 hours (adding 20+ worked examples)
- Practice problems: 20-30 hours
TOTAL: 170-240 hours of development work

Priority: HIGH - These are the most heavily weighted ACT topics
Recommendation: Start with Phase 1 (quizzes + geometry diagrams) immediately
