## 🔍 Before/After Samples

### Sample 1: Chapter 1 - Backsolving

#### BEFORE (41 h3 tags - mostly garbage):
```html
<h2>Lesson: Backsolving</h2>
<h3>Lesson: Backsolving</h3>  <!-- Duplicate -->
<h3>Backsolving can be done using five steps:</h3>
<h3>1.</h3>  <!-- Number as heading -->
<p>Start with B or C...</p>
<h3>2.</h3>  <!-- Number as heading -->
<p>Solve the question...</p>
<h3>3.</h3>
<h3>4.</h3>
<h3>5.</h3>
<div class="example-box">
  <h3>A. 2</h3>  <!-- Answer choice as heading -->
  <h3>B. 6</h3>  <!-- Answer choice as heading -->
  <h3>V6+10—2V6—2=0</h3>  <!-- Equation as heading -->
  <h3>V16 —2V4 =0</h3>  <!-- Equation as heading -->
  <h3>4—2(2)</h3>  <!-- Equation as heading -->
  <h3>= 0</h3>  <!-- Operator as heading -->
  <h3>0=0</h3>  <!-- Equation as heading -->
</div>
```

#### AFTER (1 h3 tag - clean and organized):
```html
<h2>Backsolving</h2>

<p>In the first two lessons, you will learn two important test-taking techniques...</p>

<p>Backsolving is plugging the answer choices back into the question...</p>

<h3>Backsolving can be done using five steps</h3>

<p>Start with B or C. Plug the value in the answer choice...</p>
<p>Solve the question using this value...</p>
<p>If this answer choice works correctly, you're done!</p>
<p>If this answer choice does not work, cross it off...</p>
<p>Pick one of the remaining answer choices...</p>

<div class="example-box" style="margin: 1.5rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #4CAF50;">
  <h4 style="margin: 0 0 1rem 0; color: #2c3e50;">Example 1: If √(x + 10) − 2√(x − 2) = 0, what is the value of x?</h4>

  <p style="margin: 0.25rem 0;">C. 14</p>
  <p style="margin: 0.25rem 0;">D. 18</p>
  <p><strong>Solution: The quickest and easiest way to solve this question is backsolving...</strong></p>
  <p>V6+10—2V6—2=0</p>
  <p>V16 —2V4 =0</p>
  <p>4—2(2) = 0</p>
  <p>0=0 ✓</p>
  <p>The answer is B.</p>
</div>

### Sample 2: Chapter 17 - Trigonometry (Worst Case)

#### BEFORE (427 h3 tags! Completely unreadable):
- Hundreds of h3 tags for answer choices, equations, angle measures, ratios, etc.
- Students would see "SOH CAH TOA", "sin", "cos", "30°", "45°", "60°" all as h3 headings
- Every single answer choice and equation was an h3

#### AFTER (0 h3 tags - clean and professional):
- Clean introduction paragraphs
- Properly formatted content
- Examples in styled boxes
- No garbage headings

---

### Sample 3: Chapter 33 - Shifting and Transforming Functions

#### BEFORE (124 h3 tags):
```html
<h3>1.</h3>
<h3>2.</h3>
<h3>3.</h3>
<h3>4.</h3>
<h3>64</h3>
<h3>3</h3>
<h3>2</h3>
<h3>4</h3>
<h3>5</h3>
<h3>= 5%</h3>
<h3>A.</h3>
<h3>13</h3>
<h3>B.</h3>
<h3>17</h3>
```

#### AFTER (1 h3 tag):
```html
<h2>Shifting and Transforming Functions</h2>

<p>On the ACT, you need to know how lines, parabolas, cubics, and other functions shift...</p>

<h3>Rules for Shifting and Transforming Functions</h3>

<p>Numbers inside the parentheses shift a function horizontally...</p>
<p>Numbers outside the parentheses shift a function vertically...</p>
...
```
