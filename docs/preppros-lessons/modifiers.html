<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">A <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">misplaced modifier</strong> is a word, <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong>, or clause that is improperly separated from the noun</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">that it modifies. A <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">misplaced modifier</strong> leads to a sentence that has an incorrect or unintended meaning.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Misplaced modifiers</strong> are hard to spot because we usually know what the sentence is really supposed to</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">be saying.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">So what's wrong here? The modifier ‚Äúconsistently erupting‚Äù is supposed to be modifying the Old</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Faithful geyser, but instead it is modifying Jack! Let‚Äôs hope Jack is not consistently erupting. When a</p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0; color: #065f46;">Since it is consistently erupting, Jack loves taking pictures of the Old Faithful geyser at</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">In the first correct version, the modifier ‚Äúconsistently erupting‚Äù is right next to and correctly modifying</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">the Old Faithful geyser. In the second correct version, we added a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun</strong> ‚Äúit‚Äù to change the modifier</p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0; color: #1e3a8a;">For a modifier to be properly placed, it must be right ‚Äúnext-door‚Äù to the noun it is describing. Modifiers can be at the beginning, middle, or end of a sentence. If the modifier is at the beginning of the sentence, the first noun after must be the word being modified. cn Running from the police, Eric hopped the fence and hid underneatha car. If the modifier is in the middle or end of the sentence, it must be modifying the noun directly before it. Dr. Anderson, a world-renown surgeon, fixed my broken leg. ar, - 62 - PrepPros ACT English Course Front of the Sentence Modifiers with a Comma On the ACT, most <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">misplaced modifiers</strong> questions have a modifier at the front of the sentence separated by a comma. For this type of question, consider who or what the modifier is describing and then make sure that person, place, or thing is the first noun in the rest of the sentence. Incorrect: Not popular since the early 1980s, the documentary about mullets explored the origins of the wildly popular hairstyle. Correct: Not popular since the early 1980s, mullets were the topic of a recently released documentary. The modifier is ‚Äúnot popular since the early 1980s,‚Äù so the next noun must be whoever or whatever the modifier is describing. In the incorrect version, the next noun ‚Äúdocumentaries‚Äù is not what we are supposed to be describing. The correct version puts the described word ‚Äúmullets‚Äù right next-door to the modifier at the beginning of the sentence. Practice: 1. Addressing the group of reporters gathered A. NO CHANGE B. the police chief said he did not know if the outside of the police station, there was no suspect was in custody or not. 1 indication that the police chief knew if the suspect C. no indication of whether or not the suspect was in custody was given by the police was in custody or not. chief. 1 D. the police chief's report gave no indication of whether the suspect was in custody or not. | 2.

Incorrect: The research team, which arrived at their nesting grounds early this year, tracked the movements of the blue storks. Correct: The research team tracked the movements of the blue storks, which arrived at their nesting grounds early this year. Correct: The research team, which tracked the movement of the blue storks, noted that the birds arrived at their nesting grounds early. In the incorrect example, the modifier ‚Äúwhich arrived at their nesting grounds early this year‚Äù was incorrectly modifying the research team. However, this modifier should be modifying the blue storks, so the first correct example moves the modifier to the end of the sentence right ‚Äúnext-door‚Äù to the blue storks. We could also fix the incorrect sentence by changing the modifier in the middle as is displayed in the second correct example. The new modifier ‚Äúwhich tracked the movement of the blue storks‚Äù now properly modifies the research team. Practice: There was little doubt that the new technique for 1. A. NO CHANGE B. which had been caught earlier this deep frying the cod, which uses less oil and a new morning 1 type of batter, results in a more crispy and less C. one that is popular among locals D. using hotter oil and smaller pieces of fish 1 oily breading. Modifiers without Commas In some questions, the modifier will not be separated by any commas. These are the harder to spot, but the ‚Äúnext-door neighbor‚Äô rule still applies. Keep an eye out for <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong> starting with ‚Äúthat‚Äù or words ending in ‚Äú-ing‚Äù and ‚Äú-ed.‚Äù Incorrect: A tarantula bit one of my coworkers that had a huge, hairy body. Correct: A tarantula that had a huge, hairy body bit one of my coworkers. The incorrect sentence has the modifier ‚Äúthat had a huge, hairy body‚Äù describing the coworker and not the tarantula. By moving the modifier right next to the tarantula in the correct sentence, we are describing the tarantula as having a huge, hairy body. Practice: 1. Three businessmen talked on the balcony A. NO CHANGE B. celebrating the deal talked on the balcony 1 smoking cigars. smoking cigars to celebrate the deal, : C. smoking cigars talked to celebrate the deal on the balcony. D. smoking cigars to celebrate the deal talked on the balcony. - 64 - PrepPros ACT English Course Prepositional <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Phrases</strong> as Modifiers Prepositional <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong> can also act as modifiers and must be placed in the correct position to have the intended meaning. These occur less commonly on the ACT and are often difficult to spot. Incorrect: Paul and his father talked about the baseball game in the stands. Correct: In the stands, Paul and his father talked about the baseball game. In the first sentence, the baseball game is in the stands. We know that‚Äôs not the case, so we need to move the prepositional <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> ‚Äúin the stands‚Äù to the beginning of the sentence. Now, the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> is describing Paul and his father as being in the stands. Practice: 1. The Subaru dealership sold the new car to the The best placement for the underlined portion would be: buyer with automatic parallel parking. A. where it is now. 1 B. after the word Subaru. C . after the word sold. D . after the word car. Modifiers in Parentheses Modifiers that are set apart in parentheses must be placed directly ‚Äúnext-door‚Äù to whoever or whatever they are modifying. <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Phrases</strong> in parentheses will always be in the middle or end of the sentence, so the word being described must be right before the parentheses. This type of <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">misplaced modifier</strong> is very rarely test on the ACT. Incorrect: The scientists tried to develop a new method to make their self-pollination study (where pollen from the same plant arrives at the stigma of the flower) completely free of pollen contamination from other plants. Correct: The scientists tried to develop a new method to study self-pollination (where pollen from the same plant arrives at the stigma of the flower) completely free of pollen contamination from other plants. The modifier in the parentheses is defining what self-pollination is, so self-pollination must be directly before the parentheses, as it is in the correct sentence. In the incorrect sentence, the word study is directly before the parentheses, so the modifier in parentheses is incorrectly describing the selfpollination study. Practice: Plant the roses in a sunny spot in the backyard 1. A. NO CHANGE and be sure to water them every day just after B. recommended the expert gardener sunrise, the expert gardener recommended (who C. was the expert gardener‚Äôs recommendation had been growing and selling his own roses for D. the gardener, who was an expert, recommended the past two decades). -65 - PrepPros ACT English Course</p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0; color: #1e3a8a;">The hardest part about <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">misplaced modifiers</strong> questions is spotting them! Most students think these questions are about phrasing or flow and never realize what they are actually being tested on. <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Misplaced modifiers</strong> questions always have at least one and, very often, both of the following defining characteristics: 1. All 4 answer choices are similar in length, and the answer choices have the same words scrambled in different orders. Anytime you see 4 long answer choices that are all saying the same general thing in different orders, you are very likely looking at a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">misplaced modifiers</strong> question. 2. The first word varies in the answer choices. If the first word or group of words is different in 3 or 4 of the answer choices, the question is most likely testing you on <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">misplaced modifiers</strong>. On the ACT, <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">misplaced modifiers</strong> questions will look like this: Analyzing the ultraviolet camera footage, scientists discovered that fish communicate using UV coloration and 1.

C. it was discovered by scientists that fish communicate using UV coloration and signaling. D. UV coloration and signaling were discovered as a way fish communicate.
