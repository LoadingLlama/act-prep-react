On the ACT, just remember that:</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Semicolon</strong> = period</p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0; color: #1e3a8a;">A <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">colon</strong> can join two <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">independent clauses</strong> if the second clause after the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">colon</strong> acts as a definition, an example, an explanation, or a clarification of the first clause. This is an advanced grammar rule that rarely appears on the ACT. Correct: Buddy got what he worked for: he really deserved that promotion. Correct: My father gave me one rule to live by: honesty is always the best policy. Since we are connecting two <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">independent clauses</strong>, the examples above also would be correct with a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">semicolon</strong>, a period, or a comma + <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">FANBOYS</strong>. However, sometimes the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">colon</strong> is the only correct option given in the answer choices. <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Semicolons</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Colons</strong>, and Commas Practice: Select which punctuation is correct. Some questions may have multiple correct answers. 1. James knew exactly how to make spaghetti (, / ; /: ) boil water, add salt, and then add the pasta. 2.

PrepPros ACT English Course Dashes Dashes can function like unnecessary information commas, parentheses, or <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">colons</strong>. Most commonly on the ACT, 2 dashes function like unnecessary information commas or parentheses to separate unnecessary information in the middle of a sentence. Correct: Residents of Washington D.C. - the capital of the United States - are still trying to get representation in Congress. Correct: Glazed donuts - even if they are unhealthy - are my favorite. Keep an eye out for pairs of dashes setting apart unnecessary information. A pair of dashes sets apart unnecessary information in the same way that a pair of commas does. It is important to remember that you cannot mix punctuation! It must be a pair of commas, a pair of dashes, or a pair of parentheses. Incorrect: Deep-dish pizza - a famous meal in Chicago, does not exist in Italy. Correct: Deep-dish pizza, a famous meal in Chicago, does not exist in Italy. Correct: Deep-dish pizza - a famous meal in Chicago - does not exist in Italy. Correct: Deep-dish pizza (a famous meal in Chicago) does not exist in Italy. On more difficult questions, a single <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">dash</strong> can act as a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">colon</strong> introducinga list of multiple items, a list of one item, an example, an explanation, a definition, or a clarification. When acting as a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">colon</strong>, a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">dash</strong> must follow the same 3 <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">colon</strong> rules we just covered on page 30.

Possession Rules <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Apostrophes</strong> are most commonly used to show possession. For singular nouns, add an <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">apostrophe</strong> and the letter “s” to the end of the word to show possession. Correct: Terrence’s bike is much faster than my brother’s roller blades. For singular words that end in the letter “s,” such as “bus,” we can add an <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">apostrophe</strong> and the letter “s” or just add an <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">apostrophe</strong>. Both are technically correct. The ACT has not tested this specific rule yet, but it is good to know just in case. Correct: The bus’s driver asKed us to sit down. Correct: The bus’ driver asked us to sit down. For plural nouns that end in “s,” add the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">apostrophe</strong> after the “s” to show possession. Correct: The boys’ jerseys were all covered in mud after the game. Some plural nouns do not end in the letter “s.” For these, add an <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">apostrophe</strong> and the letter “s” to the end of the word to show possession. Correct: Our women’s basketball team won the championship last year.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0; color: #1e3a8a;">The ACT asks you to pick between singular possessive, plural possessive, and non-possessive, plural words. The challenge is that the words sound very similar, as you can see here: Correct: | accidentally stepped on the dog’s bone. (singular possessive) Correct: The dogs’ collars are in the basket by the door. (plural possessive) Correct: | watched as the dogs played in the yard. (non-possessive plural) Before adding an <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">apostrophe</strong>, make sure the next word is actually being possessed by the noun. In the first example, the dog is possessing the bone. In the second example, the dogs are possessing the collars. In the third example, the dogs are not possessing the played, so there is no possession. <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Apostrophes</strong> Practice: 1. The (witch’s/witches’/witches) magic broom allowed her to fly. 2. Mary had three children, and all of the (kid’s/ kids’/kids) heights were marked on the garage door. 3. The earthquake knocked all the (door’s/doors’/doors) off their hinges. 4. The lawyer demanded that his (client’s/clients’/clients) testimony be removed from the record. 5 It should be illegal to steal (eagle’s/eagles’/eagles) eggs from their nests. PrepPros ACT English Course Possessive <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Pronouns</strong> Possessive <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronouns</strong> (his, hers, its, theirs, ours, yours) end in an “s” and do not use an <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">apostrophe</strong> to show possession. The difficulty is that words like “yours” and “ours” may look like they may need an <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">apostrophe</strong>. The correct and incorrect versions of possessive <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronouns</strong> are shown below: Correct Its Incorrect It’s Its’ Hers Her’s Hers’ Yours Your's Yours’ Ours Our’s Ours’ Theirs Their’s Theirs’ Contractions For a contraction, add an <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">apostrophe</strong>. For example, “it’s” is a contraction for “itis” and “they're” is a contraction for “they are.”</p>

  <h4 style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 700; margin: 0 0 0.75rem 0; font-size: 1.1rem;">💡 TIP: Possessive Pronouns vs. Contractions</h4>
  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0; color: #1e3a8a;">If you need to pick between a conjunction and a possessive <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">pronoun</strong>, plug in the complete <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> and see if it works. The cat loves playing with (its/it’s) newtoy. The cat loves playing with itis new toy. (plugin “it is”) (well that is wrong) So the answer is: Correct: The cat loves playing with its new toy. Let’s practice with the most commonly featured contractions on the ACT: “its” (possessive) vs. “it’s” (it is) I cannot believe that (its/it’s) not butter! The dog keeps chasing (its/it’s) tail. “your” (possessive) vs. “you're” (you are) Please keep (your/you’re) feelings to yourself. (Your/you're) not going to believe what happened on Game of Thrones! “their” (possessive) vs. “they're” (they are) The gold medal winners all held up (their/they’re) medals for the picture. (Their/They’re) going to the opera despite the bad reviews. “whose” (possessive) vs. “who's” (who is) I do not know (whose/who’s) socks these are. Honestly, (whose/who’s) going to pay fifteen dollars for a burrito? PrepPros ACT English Course <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Quotation Marks</strong> <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Quotation marks</strong> are most commonly used for direct quotes. Direct quotes that are spoken are offset by a comma. Anytime the quote is actually being spoken in some way (said, yelled, whispered, exclaimed, etc.), there is a comma before or after the quotation. Correct: Abigail said, “I will not pay until the painting is completed.” Correct: “The thunderstorm last night woke me up,” Paul whispered. Direct quotes that are not spoken have no commas. If the quote is not being spoken and is just a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrase</strong> or part of the sentence, there is no punctuation. Incorrect: My grandfather described the shells as, “beautiful souvenirs from a past life.” Correct: My grandfather described the shells as “beautiful souvenirs from a past life.” Here, the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">quotation marks</strong> show “beautiful souvenirs from a past life” are the grandfather’s words and not the writer’s words. Since the words are not actually being spoken by the grandfather, there is no comma before the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">quotation marks</strong>. <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Quotation marks</strong> can be used to show a word is being used as a technical term, used in an unusual or slang way, or used as another expression that varies from standard usage. Correct: Having defined the term “contact variance,” Dr. Chen continued his lecture. Correct: Sven refers to himself as a “professional” influencer. Correct: This “revolutionary” program has left thousands of children without a basic education.
