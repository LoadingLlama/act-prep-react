<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Adding and deleting information questions are among the most important question types on the ACT English Test, testing your ability to evaluate whether information is <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">relevant</strong> to the passage's focus. Instead of testing grammar rules, these questions require you to read for context and determine whether a sentence or phrase strengthens the passage or distracts from its main point. This skill is essential because it tests both reading comprehension and your ability to identify what makes writing effective and purposeful.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">1. What are adding and deleting information questions?</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Adding and deleting information questions ask you to evaluate whether specific information should be included in or removed from a passage. These questions test your understanding of <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">relevance</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">context</strong>, and the passage's main focus. Unlike grammar questions, which have objective right answers based on rules, these questions require you to analyze the passage's purpose and determine what information contributes to that purpose.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The ACT includes two main types of adding and deleting questions, and understanding the format of each type helps you answer them efficiently.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Adding information questions</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Type 1:</strong> The question presents a sentence or phrase and asks "Should the writer make this addition here?" The answer choices have two parts:
    <ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li>Yes or No (should the information be added)</li>
      <li>A justification explaining why the information should or should not be added</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Type 2:</strong> The question underlines a portion of text and asks "At this point, the writer is considering revising the underlined portion to the following:" followed by an alternative version. You must decide if the revision improves the passage.</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Deleting information questions</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Type 1:</strong> The question asks "Should the underlined portion be kept or deleted?" with answer choices structured the same way as adding questions (kept/deleted plus justification).</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Type 2:</strong> The question asks "If the writer were to delete the preceding sentence, the paragraph would primarily lose:" followed by answer choices describing what information would be lost.</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">When these questions appear</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Adding and deleting questions typically appear 3-6 times per ACT English Test</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">They can appear anywhere in a passage but most commonly in the middle or end of paragraphs</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">The questions always require you to consider the broader <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">context</strong> beyond just the sentence in question</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">These questions test reading comprehension as much as writing skills</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin: 0 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 0.75rem; border-left: 4px solid #b91c1c; color: #000000; font-weight: 700;">Example 1: Basic adding information question</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Prior to accepting her promotion to head of marine biology, Dr. Martinez had spent the last ten years studying coral reef ecosystems in the Caribbean. During this research period, Dr. Martinez documented over 400 species of fish, discovering several previously unknown patterns in their behavior.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">At this point, the writer is considering adding the following true statement:</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"><em>As a young student, Dr. Martinez attended Stanford University, where she studied environmental science and played on the varsity soccer team, before enrolling at UC San Diego's Marine Biology program.</em></p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Should the writer make this addition here?</p>

<p style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">A. Yes, because it establishes Dr. Martinez's academic credentials.</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">B. Yes, because it indicates that Dr. Martinez had a well-rounded education.</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">C. No, because it does not specify what position Dr. Martinez held at Stanford.</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">D. No, because the information is not relevant to the passage's focus on Dr. Martinez's marine biology career.</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">E. No, because it contradicts information presented earlier in the passage.</span>
</p>

<p style="margin: 1.5rem 0 0.75rem 0;"><strong>Solution:</strong></p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Read the paragraph with and without the proposed addition to understand what it contributes</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Identify the passage's main focus - this paragraph discusses Dr. Martinez's marine biology research and career advancement</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Evaluate the proposed addition - it discusses her undergraduate education and athletic activities, which are unrelated to her marine biology work</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Eliminate "Yes" answers (A and B) because the information is <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">irrelevant</strong> to the passage's focus</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 5:</strong> Evaluate the "No" justifications - D correctly identifies that the information about Stanford and soccer is not <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">relevant</strong> to Dr. Martinez's marine biology career</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"><strong>Answer: D</strong></p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The proposed sentence contains true information and establishes credentials, but it distracts from the paragraph's focus on Dr. Martinez's professional marine biology work. Information about undergraduate sports is <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">irrelevant</strong> here.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">2. How to answer adding and deleting information questions</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Follow these four steps to answer adding and deleting information questions efficiently and accurately:</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Step 1: Read for context</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">The most common mistake on these questions is failing to read enough <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">context</strong></li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">At minimum, read the sentence before and after the question</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">For most questions, read the entire paragraph containing the question
    <ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li>Some questions require reading the previous paragraph or the entire passage</li>
      <li>Look for clues in the question itself about how much to read</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Identify the paragraph's main point and purpose before evaluating the question</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Step 2: Read twice - with and without the information</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">For adding questions: Read the paragraph once without the proposed addition, then once with it included</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">For deleting questions: Read the paragraph as written (with the information), then mentally remove it and read again</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">This double reading makes it immediately clear whether the information strengthens or weakens the passage</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Pay attention to whether the information:
    <ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li>Supports the paragraph's main idea</li>
      <li>Provides necessary clarification or detail</li>
      <li>Introduces <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">irrelevant</strong> information that distracts from the focus</li>
      <li>Creates <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">redundancy</strong> by repeating information already stated</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Step 3: Evaluate the justifications carefully</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">The justification must accurately describe what the information does or does not contribute</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Common wrong answer traps:
    <ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li><strong>Too broad:</strong> Justifications that go beyond what the specific sentence actually says</li>
      <li><strong>True but irrelevant:</strong> Justifications that correctly describe the information but don't explain why it should be included or excluded</li>
      <li><strong>Factually incorrect:</strong> Justifications that mischaracterize what the information actually states</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Look for justifications that directly relate to the passage's main focus and the information in question</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">The correct justification should make logical sense based solely on the information being added or deleted</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Step 4: Consider relevance above all else</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Relevance</strong> is the most important criterion for adding or deleting information</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Information should be included if it:
    <ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li>Directly supports the main point of the paragraph or passage</li>
      <li>Provides necessary clarification for unclear terms or concepts</li>
      <li>Offers specific examples that illustrate a general statement</li>
      <li>Creates logical transitions or connections between ideas</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Information should be deleted if it:
    <ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li>Discusses topics unrelated to the paragraph's focus</li>
      <li>Repeats information already stated (creates <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">redundancy</strong>)</li>
      <li>Introduces tangential details that distract from the main point</li>
      <li>States information that is obvious from <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">context</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin: 0 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 0.75rem; border-left: 4px solid #b91c1c; color: #000000; font-weight: 700;">Example 2: Deleting information question</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Marcus and Elena have joined a growing number of urban farmers in Portland who practice <strong><u>rooftop agriculture, which involves growing crops on the tops of buildings in cities</u></strong>. Rather than relying on traditional farmland, they transform unused rooftop spaces into productive gardens. "It's a way to bring fresh food directly to city residents," explains Marcus. "We can harvest vegetables in the morning and have them at the farmers market by afternoon."</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The writer is considering deleting the underlined portion. Should the underlined portion be kept or deleted?</p>

<p style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">A. Kept, because it provides a necessary definition of a potentially unfamiliar term.</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">B. Kept, because it explains the environmental benefits of rooftop agriculture.</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">C. Deleted, because it repeats information that is obvious from the context.</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">D. Deleted, because it contradicts the information in the following sentence.</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">E. Deleted, because it shifts focus away from Marcus and Elena's specific farming practices.</span>
</p>

<p style="margin: 1.5rem 0 0.75rem 0;"><strong>Solution:</strong></p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Read the entire paragraph for <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">context</strong> - it discusses Marcus and Elena's rooftop farming practice</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Read the sentence with the underlined portion: "rooftop agriculture, which involves growing crops on the tops of buildings in cities"</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Read without it: "rooftop agriculture" - the term's meaning is clear from the phrase "rooftop" itself and the surrounding <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">context</strong></li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Evaluate whether the definition adds value - the explanation "growing crops on the tops of buildings in cities" merely restates what "rooftop agriculture" obviously means</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 5:</strong> The definition is <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">redundant</strong> because the term is self-explanatory and the next sentence provides additional clarification</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"><strong>Answer: C</strong></p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The underlined definition should be deleted because it explains something already obvious from the term "rooftop agriculture" and the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">context</strong>. The following sentences make the meaning even clearer without the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">redundant</strong> definition.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">3. Common adding and deleting mistakes</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Understanding common mistakes helps you avoid them and approach these questions strategically. Most errors occur because students don't read enough <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">context</strong> or choose justifications that don't accurately match the information being evaluated.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Mistake 1: Not reading enough context</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">The most common error is rushing through the question without reading the full paragraph</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">You cannot determine <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">relevance</strong> without understanding the paragraph's main focus</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Always read at minimum:
    <ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li>The sentence before the question</li>
      <li>The sentence containing the question</li>
      <li>The sentence after the question</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">For best results, read the entire paragraph before answering</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Mistake 2: Choosing overly broad justifications</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Wrong answer choices often provide justifications that go beyond what the sentence actually says</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Example: A sentence mentions "Stanford University" and a wrong answer says "because it establishes the character's academic excellence" when the sentence doesn't actually discuss excellence</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">The justification must accurately reflect only what the specific sentence states, not what you might infer</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Focus on the literal content of the information being added or deleted</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Mistake 3: Confusing "true" with "relevant"</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Questions often note that proposed additions are "true statements" to tempt you</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Just because information is factually accurate doesn't mean it belongs in the passage</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Information must be both true AND <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">relevant</strong> to the passage's focus to be added</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Always evaluate whether the true information actually supports the paragraph's main point</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Mistake 4: Ignoring the passage's specific focus</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Every passage and paragraph has a specific focus or purpose</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Information that seems generally related may still be <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">irrelevant</strong> to the specific focus</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Example: In a passage about someone's medical career, information about their undergraduate sports activities is typically <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">irrelevant</strong></li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Always ask: "Does this information directly support what this paragraph is trying to communicate?"</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Mistake 5: Not using the double-reading strategy</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Reading the paragraph only once makes it harder to evaluate the information's impact</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Always read twice: once with the information and once without it</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">This comparison makes it immediately obvious whether the information strengthens or weakens the passage</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">The passage should flow logically and stay focused with or without the questioned information</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin: 0 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 0.75rem; border-left: 4px solid #b91c1c; color: #000000; font-weight: 700;">Example 3: "What would the passage lose" question</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Several popular eco-tourism destinations have been negatively impacted by excessive visitor traffic. <strong><u>It is not uncommon for tourists to wander off designated trails, leave trash behind, and disturb local wildlife habitats.</u></strong> To address these problems, certain destinations like the Galapagos Islands have implemented strict visitor limits and require all tourists to travel with certified guides who ensure proper behavior.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">If the writer were to delete the underlined sentence, the paragraph would primarily lose:</p>

<p style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">A. An explanation of why eco-tourism became popular in these regions.</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">B. Specific examples of how tourists have negatively impacted eco-tourism destinations.</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">C. Information about the Galapagos Islands' unique ecosystem.</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">D. Details about what certified guides do to protect the environment.</span><br>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">E. Statistics showing the increase in eco-tourism over the past decade.</span>
</p>

<p style="margin: 1.5rem 0 0.75rem 0;"><strong>Solution:</strong></p>

<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Read the entire paragraph to understand its structure and main point</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Identify what the underlined sentence does - it provides specific examples of tourist behavior (wandering off trails, leaving trash, disturbing wildlife)</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Note the paragraph's logic: First sentence states destinations are "negatively impacted," underlined sentence shows HOW, third sentence describes solutions to "these problems"</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Read the paragraph without the underlined sentence - the connection between "negatively impacted" and "these problems" becomes unclear without concrete examples</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong>Step 5:</strong> Evaluate each answer choice:
    <ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li>A is incorrect - the sentence doesn't explain why eco-tourism became popular</li>
      <li>B is correct - the sentence provides specific examples (trails, trash, wildlife) of the negative impacts mentioned in sentence 1</li>
      <li>C is incorrect - the sentence doesn't discuss the Galapagos ecosystem</li>
      <li>D is incorrect - the sentence doesn't describe what guides do</li>
      <li>E is incorrect - no statistics are mentioned</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"><strong>Answer: B</strong></p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The underlined sentence provides concrete examples that illustrate the abstract phrase "negatively impacted" from the first sentence. Without these examples, readers wouldn't understand what specific problems the third sentence's solutions are addressing. The sentence serves as a crucial bridge between identifying the problem and presenting the solution.</p>
