Chapter 1: Backsolving —

In the first two chapters, you will learn two important test-taking techniques: backsolving and substitution. As
you work through the rest of the book, use these techniques whenever you can to solve questions.

Backsolving is plugging the answer choices back into the question. On the ACT, you are given 4 answer
choices for multiple choice questions, and one of those 4 choices must be correct. Rather than solving the
question algebraically and determining whether your answer matches one of the answer choices, you can
guess-and-check with the answer choices to find which one is correct. Backsolving is often the fastest and
easiest way to solve ACT questions, especially if you get stuck and cannot solve a question algebraically, so
use it to your advantage.
Backsolving can be done using five steps:

1.

Start with B or C. Plug the value in the answer choice back into the question. The answer choices
are always in order of smallest to largest or largest to smallest so starting in the middle saves you time.

2.

Solve the question using this value. Find any other unknowns if necessary.

3.

If this answer choice works correctly, you’re done! Bubble it in and move on.

4.

If this answer choice does not work, cross it off. If you know the correct answer needs to be smaller
or larger than the value you just tried, cross off any other incorrect answers.

5.

Pick one of the remaining answer choices and plug it back into the question. Repeat this until

you find the correct answer. Remember, one of the 5 answer choices must work!

Example 1: If Vx + 10 — 2Vx — 2 = 0, what is the value of x?
A. 2

B. 6

C.

14

D.

18

Solution: The quickest and easiest way to solve this question is backsolving. Finding the correct answer is
just a process of guess-and-check. Below, you can see how the correct answer B, when x = 6, makes the
equation be true.
V6+10—2V6—-—2=0

V16 —2V4 =0
4—2(2)
= 0
4—-4=0
0=0

The answer is B. If we plug in any of the other answer choices, we will get an equation that is not equal on

both sides and is incorrect.

Example 2: Which of the following is a solution to the equation of x? + 5x? + 6x =0?
A)

-3

B)-1

Solution: Most students look at this question and think, “Oh no, I need to factor this to solve.” However, the
easiest way to solve this question is backsolving! We plug the answer choices into the equation to see which
one makes it equal 0. Below, you can see how the correct answer, when x = —3, makes the equation be true.

(—3)? + 5(—3)? + 6(-3) = 0
—27+45-18=0
0=0

The answer is A. If we plug in any other answer choices, the equation will not equal 0.

Backsolving With Points
For questions with points in the question or answer choices, it is often effective to backsolve with points. For
this method, we will use the point(s) to test which equation works correctly. Remember, if a point is on a
graph, it must make the equation of the graph true.

Example 3: A linear function f passes through the points (1,5), (3,9), and (7,17). Which of the
following equations defines f?

A) f(x) =2x+5

B) f@)=x+5

C)

fx) =4x4+1

D) f(x)
= 2x+3

Solution: Here, the simplest way to solve is to test the answer choices using the points in the question. Let’s

start with the point (1,5). When we plug in x = 1, we need to get f(1) = 5.
For answer choice A:

f(1) =2(1)+5

—->

f(1) =7_

(Ais incorrect.)

For answer choice B: f(1) =1+5

>

f(1)=6-

(Bis incorrect.)

For answer choice C: f(1) =4(1) +1

-

f()=5

(C works.)

For answer choice D: f(1) = 2(1)+3

-

fQ)=5

(Dworks.)

Answer choices A and B do not work, so we can eliminate those answer choices. Answer choices C and D

both work, so we need to use a second point to test answer choices C and D. Let’s use the point (3, 9).

For answer choice C: f(3) = 4(3)

+1.

—-

f()=13 =

(Cis incorrect.)

For answer choice D: f(3) = 2(3)+3.

-

f()=9 ~~ (Discorrect.)

The answer is D. As you can see, we can solve this question by backsolving with points. This method is
much easier than solving this question algebraically.
