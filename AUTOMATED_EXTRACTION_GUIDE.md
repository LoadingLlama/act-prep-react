# üöÄ Fully Automated ACT Test Extraction

## YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING!

This script extracts an entire ACT practice test from OCR PDF + TXT file with **ZERO manual work**.

---

## ‚úÖ What It Does Automatically

1. **Extracts clean passage text from OCR PDF**
2. **Parses all 215 questions from TXT file**
3. **Loads answer keys from JSON file**
4. **Assigns question types** (grammar, algebra, main-idea, data-interpretation, etc.)
5. **Assigns ACT reporting categories** (CSE, PHM-F, KID, IOD, etc.)
6. **Links questions to passages** (foreign keys)
7. **Inserts everything into Supabase**
8. **Runs verification checks**
9. **Generates extraction log**

## üìã Usage

### Single Command:

```bash
node scripts/extraction/extract-full-test-automated.mjs <test_number> <pdf_path> <txt_path> <answer_key_json>
```

### Example:

```bash
node scripts/extraction/extract-full-test-automated.mjs 2 \
  "/Users/cadenchiang/Desktop/actprep copy/actclass.org/practice acts/ocr_Practice ACT 2.pdf" \

## üéØ Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `test_number` | The test number (1-7) | `2` |
| `pdf_path` | Full path to OCR PDF | `"/path/to/test2.pdf"` |
| `txt_path` | Full path to TXT file | `"/path/to/test2.txt"` |
| `answer_key_json` | Path to answer key JSON | `"/path/to/answers2.json"` |

**Important:** Use quotes around paths with spaces!

## üîë Answer Key JSON Format

Create a JSON file with this structure:

```json
{
  "english": {
    "1": "C",
    "2": "B",
    "3": "A",
    ...
    "75": "D"
  },
  "math": {
    "1": "E",
    "2": "G",
    ...
    "60": "K"
  },
  "reading": {
    "1": "B",
    "2": "C",
    ...
    "40": "A"
  },
  "science": {
    "1": "D",
    "2": "F",
    ...
    "40": "C"
  }
}
```

**Where to find answer keys:**
- Check the OCR PDF (usually has an answer key section at the end)
- Check for separate answer key documents
- The TXT file diagnostic sheets do NOT contain answers (only question types)

- ‚úÖ 75 English questions (with `passage_number`)
- ‚úÖ 60 Math questions
- ‚úÖ 40 Reading questions (with `passage_id`)
- ‚úÖ 40 Science questions (with `passage_id`)

### Passages (16 total):

## üîç Output

The script will:
1. Print progress in real-time
2. Save extraction log to `/backups/extraction-test{N}-log.txt`
3. Run verification checks
4. Show final summary

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

### Passage Quality:
- **English passages:** Auto-cleaned, but may have minor artifacts (review recommended)
- **Reading passages:** Auto-cleaned, but may have minor artifacts (review recommended)
- **Science passages:** Stubs created, manual table/figure extraction may be needed

### If Extraction Issues Occur:
The script handles most cases automatically, but if passages have too many artifacts:
1. Check the extraction log
2. Manually review passages in Supabase
3. Edit specific passages using UPDATE queries if needed

## üéâ That's It!

Just provide the PDF + TXT, run one command, and everything is automatically extracted into your database!
