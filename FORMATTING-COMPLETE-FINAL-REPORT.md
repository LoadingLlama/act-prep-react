## üîß FIXES APPLIED

### 1. Test 3 English - CRITICAL FIX (75 questions)

**Original Problem:**
- Question_stem contained only the question ("Which of the following...")
- Students had NO sentence context to answer questions
- **Test was UNUSABLE**

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// Reconstructed from database fields:
newQuestionStem = context_before + '<u>' + underlined_text + '</u>' + context_after
```

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ All 75/75 questions successfully fixed
- ‚úÖ Changed from 0/75 with `<u>` tags ‚Üí 75/75 with `<u>` tags
- ‚úÖ Avg stem length: 77 chars ‚Üí 89 chars
- ‚úÖ Now matches format of Tests 1, 2, 4

**Example Fix:**
```
BEFORE: "Which of the following alternatives would NOT be acceptable?"
AFTER:  "directly on <u>Rjukan, a small town</u> in south-central Norway"
```

**Script:** `FIX-TEST3-ENGLISH-FORMAT.mjs`

### 2. Test 4 English - FORMAT ENHANCEMENT (48 questions)

**Original Problem:**
- Question_stem had full sentences but missing `<u>` tags
- Only 2/75 questions had proper markup
- Inconsistent with other tests

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// Added <u> tags around underlined portions:
newQuestionStem = question_stem.replace(underlined, `<u>${underlined}</u>`)
```

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ Fixed 48 questions (added `<u>` tags)
- ‚úÖ 2 questions already correct (no change needed)
- ‚úÖ 25 questions correctly left without tags (special question types)
- ‚úÖ Changed from 2/75 with tags ‚Üí 50/75 with tags
- ‚úÖ Now properly formatted and consistent

**Special Question Types (Correctly WITHOUT `<u>` tags):**
- Paragraph division questions
- Addition/deletion considerations
- Sentence placement/order questions
- Transition effectiveness questions

**Script:** `FIX-TEST4-ENGLISH-FORMAT.mjs`

   - 100% success rate (75/75)

3. **FIX-TEST4-ENGLISH-FORMAT.mjs**
   - Added missing `<u>` tags
   - Preserved special question types
   - Smart detection of questions needing tags

4. **FINAL-FORMAT-CONSISTENCY-CHECK.mjs**
   - Verified all fixes applied correctly in database
   - Confirmed all tests have consistent formatting
   - Production readiness verification

## ‚úÖ WHAT "CORRECT FORMAT" MEANS

### Regular ACT English Questions (60-70 per test):
```
question_stem: "The sun's rays <u>no longer shine</u> directly on Rjukan."
underlined_text: "no longer shine"
context_before: "The sun's rays"
context_after: "directly on Rjukan."
```
‚Üí **Full sentence with underlined portion marked with `<u>` tags**

### Special Questions (5-25 per test):
```
question_stem: "Which choice best suggests that the effect was immediate?"
underlined_text: "[Addition consideration]"
```
‚Üí **Question only, no sentence context (intentional for these question types)**
