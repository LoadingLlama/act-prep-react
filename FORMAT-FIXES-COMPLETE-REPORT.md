## 🎉 ISSUES FIXED

### 1. ✅ Test 3 English - CRITICAL FIX (75 questions)

**Problem:** All 75 questions had WRONG format
- **Before:** question_stem contained only the question ("Which of the following...")
- **After:** question_stem now contains full sentence with `<u>underlined portion</u>`

**Fix Applied:**
- Reconstructed question_stem from: `context_before + <u>underlined_text</u> + context_after`
- All 75/75 questions successfully converted
- **Test 3 now matches Tests 1, 2, 4 format** ✅

**Example:**
```
BEFORE: "Which of the following alternatives would NOT be acceptable?"
AFTER:  "directly on <u>Rjukan, a small town</u> in south-central Norway"
```

### 2. ✅ Test 4 English - FORMAT ENHANCEMENT (48 questions)

**Problem:** Most questions missing `<u>` tags around underlined portions

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `<u>` tags around underlined portions in 48 questions
- 25 questions intentionally left without tags (special question types)
- 2 questions already had tags

**Special Questions (Correctly WITHOUT <u> tags):**
- Paragraph division questions (Q15, Q30, Q45, Q54, Q74, Q75)
- Addition/deletion considerations (Q24, Q40, Q58, Q64)
- Sentence placement/order questions (Q38, Q45)
- Transition questions that ask about choice effectiveness

**These questions DON'T show underlined text in the stem - this is CORRECT!**

## ✅ FORMATTING CONSISTENCY VERIFIED

### What Makes Format "Correct":

**Regular Questions (60-75 per test):**
```
question_stem: "The sun's reflection off the <u>snow, working</u> some magic with the colors."
underlined_text: "snow, working"
```
→ Full sentence with underlined portion marked with `<u>` tags

**Special Questions (0-15 per test):**
```
question_stem: "Which choice best suggests that the effect..."
underlined_text: "[Addition consideration]" or similar
```
→ Question only, no sentence context (intentional for these question types)
