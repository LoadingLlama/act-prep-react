**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Current Status:** In Progress - Preparing for manual extraction

---

## üìã EXTRACTION APPROACH

Due to database schema requirements and to ensure 100% accuracy, we need the following for each question:

### Required Fields Per Question:
- ‚úÖ question_number, test_number, passage_number
- ‚úÖ question_stem (with `<u>underlined</u>` format)
- ‚úÖ underlined_text, context_before, context_after
- ‚úÖ choice_a, choice_b, choice_c, choice_d
- ‚è≥ **correct_answer** (you will upload)
- ‚è≥ **question_type** (requires categorization)
- ‚è≥ **question_category** (POW/KLA/CSE for English)
- ‚è≥ **lesson_id** (requires assignment)
- üìù difficulty_level (optional)
- üìù notes (optional)

---

## üéØ RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Initial Extraction (Questions + Passages Only)
Extract all 215 questions with:
- Proper formatting
- All choice text
- Placeholder values for: correct_answer ('A'), question_type ('general'), question_category ('CSE')
- NULL for lesson_id (will assign later)

**Benefit:** Gets all questions in database quickly, then we enhance with metadata

### Phase 2: Answer Key Upload
- You provide all 215 answer keys
- Update all correct_answer fields in one operation
- Verify 100% accuracy

### Phase 3: Categorization & Lesson Assignment
- Assign question_type and question_category to each question
- Assign lesson_id based on question type
- Similar to Tests 1-4

### Phase 4: Final Verification
- Run comprehensive accuracy check
- Verify all 215 questions complete
- Generate extraction report

## üí° DECISION NEEDED

**Would you like me to:**

1. **Extract all 215 questions now with placeholders** (faster, then you upload answer keys)
   - I'll extract all questions with proper formatting
   - Use placeholders for answer keys/types
   - You upload answer keys when ready
   - We assign question types/lessons afterward
   - **Estimated time: 2-3 hours**

2. **Wait for answer keys first, then extract** (slower, but more complete from start)
   - You upload answer keys first
   - I extract with correct answers from the start
   - Still need to assign types/lessons later
   - **Estimated time: Answer keys + 2-3 hours**

3. **Do complete extraction with all metadata** (slowest, most thorough)
   - Extract each question with full categorization
   - Requires analyzing each question individually
   - **Estimated time: 6-8 hours**
