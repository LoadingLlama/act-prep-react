Chapter 3: Geometry Part 1 — Angles
In this chapter, we will cover all the rules you need to know for angles questions on the ACT. For angles
questions, put your pencil to work by finding and labeling unknown angles. The more angles you label,
the easier it will be to find the angle you need to know to answer the question.

Intersecting Lines
If two lines intersect, what do we know about the relationships between the angles?

1.

2.

Vertical angles are equal.

Adjacent angles are supplementary (x and y add to 180°).

Parallel Lines

1 /2
3/4

5/6

/8
Given two parallel lines, we know the following are true:
1.

Vertical angles are equal (ex: 21 = 24).

2.

Alternate interior angles are equal (ex: 23 = 26).

3.

Opposite interior angles are supplementary (ex: 23 + 25 = 180° and 24 + 26 = 180°).

4.

Corresponding angles are equal (ex: 22 = 26).

All those rules and fancy terms are nice, but all you really need to know 1s that whenever two parallel lines are
intersected by another line, there are two sets of identical angles.
41=244=245=28
42=243=246=27

Any of the angles from the first list will be supplementary with any of the angles from the second list. For

example, 21 + 26 = 180° and 24 + 27 = 180°. As long as you memorize which angles are identical, you
will be able to handle parallel lines questions.
Example 1:

A

B

C

ai

D

In the figure above, AB is parallel with CD. What is the value of x?
A.

34

B. 40

C. 48

D. 56

Solution: We know that all angles in a triangle add up to 180°, so we can find the unknown third angle in the
triangle above.
Third angle = 180° — 34° — 90° = 56°

The third angle we just found and x° are alternate interior angles, so they must be equal. The answer is D.

TIP — Extend Parallel Lines
Sometimes questions with parallel lines will not always look like the parallel lines in the figure. Ifthe lines
just hit and stop (ex: the corner of a parallelogram), take your pencil and extend the lines yourself to make
the question look like the figure above. Then, it will be much easier to tell which angles are identical.

Interior Angles in Polygons
You need to know the sum of the interior angles of a...

Triangle

Quadrilateral

Pentagon

Hexagon

180°

360°

540°

720°

For any polygon,

Sum of Interior Angles = 180°(n — 2) where n is the number of sides.
It does not matter what the shape looks like. All that matters for the sum of the interior angles is the number of
sides. You can see how this works with the examples below:

ZA (IZX ©
180°

360°

540°

360°

Example 2: In AABC below, the measure of ZABD is 68°, the measure of ZACD
and AD is a bisector of CAB. What is the measure of ZADC ?
C
A.

C.

104

D. 108

is 40°, D is on BC,

D
A

68°

B

Solution: We know that all angles in a triangle add to 180°, so we can use AABC to find ZCAB.
ZCAB + ZABD + ZACD = 180°

Since we are given ZABD = 68° and ZACD = 40°, we can solve for 2CAB.
ZCAB + 68° + 40° = 180°

ZCAB = 180° — 68° — 40°
ZCAB = 72°

math

The question tells us that AD is a bisector of ZCAB. A bisector cuts an angle in half, so we know that
ZCAD = ZBAD

Since the entire angle 2CAB = 72°, we now know that ZCAD and ZBAD are half of 2CAB and
ZCAD = ZBAD = 36°

Now that we know these angles, we can use AADC to find ZADC. Again, we know all the angles in the
triangle must add to 180° so
ZADC + ZACD + ZCAD = 180°

We are given that ZACD = 40° and just found that 2CAD= 36°. Now we can solve for ZADC.
ZADC + 40° + 36° = 180°

ZADC = 180° — 40° — 36°
ZADC = 104°
The answer is D.

Example 3: For the given figure, what is the value of x?
A.

72

B.

88

C.

90

D.

105

Solution: The figure above has 5 sides, so the total interior angles are equal to 180°(5 — 2) = 540°.
x° + 1.3x° + L4x° + 1.2x° + 1.1x° = 540°
6x° = 540°
x = 90
The answer is D.

TIP — All figures are drawn to scale
All figures on the ACT are drawn to scale! You can trust the angles and side lengths in the figure.

If you are given a figure and do not know how to solve the question, look at the answer choices to see if
you can make an educated guess on which answer looks correct. Quite often, you can rule out certain
answer choices that clearly do not match the figure.
The only exception is if you see, “Note: Figure not drawn to scale.” This rarely occurs on the ACT,
but in case you do see it, do not trust the figure.

115°

65"
Note: Figure not drawn to scale.

In the figures above, we see that the angle labelled as 65° in the figure on the left is clearly incorrect. On
the other hand, the figure on the right has no note, so we know the 115° is correct and can trust how the
figure is drawn to scale.
