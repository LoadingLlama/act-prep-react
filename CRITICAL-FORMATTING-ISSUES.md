## üö® ISSUE #1: Test 3 English WRONG FORMAT (CRITICAL)

### Problem:
**All 75 Test 3 English questions have incorrect question_stem format**

### Comparison:

**Tests 1, 2, 4 (CORRECT):**
```
question_stem: "The results are songs that rarely make literal sense but nevertheless flow in a way <u>easier to dance to</u>."
underlined_text: "easier to dance to"
```
‚Üí **Full sentence with underlined portion embedded**

**Test 3 (WRONG):**
```
question_stem: "Which choice provides proper punctuation for this sentence?"
underlined_text: "reality. Three"
context_before: "Andersen made the mirrors a"
context_after: "550-square-foot mirrors were airlifted"
```
‚Üí **Only stores the question, not the full sentence!**

### Impact:
- **Students cannot answer questions** - they don't have the sentence context
- **Test 3 is UNUSABLE in its current state**
- **Major inconsistency** across all tests

### Data Analysis:
- **Affected:** All 75 Test 3 English questions
- **question_stem average length:** 77.1 chars (vs 112-142 chars for other tests)
- **Contains question words** ("Which choice...", "Should the writer...")
- **Missing sentence context** that students need

### Recommended Fix:
**Test 3 English must be completely re-extracted** to match the format of Tests 1, 2, and 4.

The proper format should be:
```
question_stem: "[full sentence with <u>underlined portion</u>]"
underlined_text: "the underlined portion"
context_before: [additional context if needed]
context_after: [additional context if needed]
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è  ISSUE #2: Test 4 Missing lesson_id (NON-CRITICAL)

### Problem:
Test 4 has `NULL` lesson_id for all questions

### Affected Sections:
- **English:** 75 questions (null lesson_id)
- **Reading:** 40 questions (null lesson_id)
- **Science:** 40 questions (null lesson_id)
- **Total:** 155 questions

### Impact:
- **Low priority** - lesson_id is an optional field
- Used for grouping questions by lessons/topics
- Can be populated later through separate assignment process

### Status:
- ‚úÖ **Not blocking** - does not affect question usability
- ‚è≥ **Can be fixed later** - separate lesson assignment process

---

## ‚úÖ Other Findings (No Issues):

### Empty Strings in Context Fields:
Some questions have empty `context_before` or `context_after` - this is **EXPECTED** for:
- Passage-level questions (Q15, Q30, Q45, Q60, Q75)
- Questions at the start/end of sentences
- **Status:** NOT an issue

### All Other Columns:
‚úÖ All required fields populated correctly
‚úÖ All answer formats correct (A/B/C/D or A-K)
‚úÖ All passage linkages valid
‚úÖ No null values in critical fields

## üéØ Required Actions:

### IMMEDIATE (CRITICAL):
1. **Re-extract Test 3 English** to match Tests 1, 2, 4 format
   - Need source TXT file for Test 3
   - Extract full sentences into question_stem
   - Ensure <u> tags properly embedded

### LATER (OPTIONAL):
2. **Populate Test 4 lesson_id** (when lesson assignment is done)

## üìÅ Source Files Needed:

For Test 3 re-extraction:
- [ ] Test 3 source TXT file location?
- [ ] Test 3 OCR PDF for verification?

**Report Status:** ‚ùå **CRITICAL ISSUE - Test 3 English unusable**
**Production Ready:** ‚ùå **NO** (until Test 3 fixed)
