Chapter 9: Words In Context Questions
Words in context questions ask you to select what a word or phrase “most nearly means” in the context

of the passage. Usually, you are asked to determine the meaning of a word or phrase that is being used in an
unusual or uncommon way in the passage, so you must go back and read the context to find the meaning.
Most often, the correct answer is not the actual definition of the word but instead an alternate meaning
based on the context.

Words in context questions always have the phrase “most nearly means” and look like this:
1.

As used in line 9, “critical” most nearly means
A.

grave

B.

negative

C.

urgent

D.

important

To find the correct answer, read for context. We recommend that you read the sentence before, the

sentence the word or phrase is in, and the following sentence. If you are still not clear on what the word or
phrase means, read for more context — as much as you need to understand the context.

How to Approach Words in Context Questions
There are two approaches that are effective for these questions.

Method #1: Pick Your Own Word
1.

Read for context. Read at least 1 sentence before and after the word or phrase in the question and
more if necessary.

2.

Pick your own word(s) to replace the word or phrase in the question. Write your word(s) down.

3.

Ifyou are having trouble picking a specific word, try to pick a tone. Decide if the tone of the
word or phrase is positive, negative, or neutral based on the surrounding text.

4.

Look at the answer choices and pick the one that best matches your word(s) or tone.

Method #2: Read the Answer Choices Back in the Passage
1.

Read each answer choice back in the passage. Make sure to still read for context when you plug in
each answer choice.

2.

Pick the answer choice that best replaces the word in the passage.

Both approaches are equally effective, so which one you use is a matter of preference.

Tips for Words in Context Questions
Before we move onto the practice passage, let’s go over a few more tips for words in context questions.

Tip #1 — Do not assume the hard vocabulary word is correct.
Words in context questions are one place the ACT commonly tests vocabulary knowledge. If you see any
word(s) that you do not know, do not assume the hard word is correct. Many students mistakenly think,
“Oh, this is the ACT...it must be the hard word since they are testing my vocabulary.” Wrong! Sometimes,
the ACT is testing your vocabulary and the hard word is correct. Other times, the hard word is just a decoy
and a simpler word that you know fits correctly.

Tip #2 — Do not pick the answer choice that defines the word.
The correct answer is rarely the definition of the word. Most commonly, the word or phrase in the passage
is used in an uncommon or unusual way that differs from the definition. However, this is not always the
case. Sometimes, the correct answer is the definition of the word. This occurs most commonly for hard
vocabulary words.

Tip #3 — Do the best you can with the words you know.
On words in context questions, do the best you can with the words you know. If there is a word you know
and it works, pick that word. If you know a word and it does not work, cross it off. If you are stuck between
two words that you do not know, bubble in your best guess and move on.
Do not waste time trying to figure out the definitions of words that you do not know. You either know
what a word means, or you don’t. No amount of time thinking about what the word means will help you.
Move on and use your time answering other questions.

This passage is adapted from “Opening of the Panama

that of our immediate neighbors. Even if the

Canal,” an article published by The Times-Picayune, a New

Orleans newspaper, in August 1914.

The Panama Canal was officially opened
yesterday when a large vessel of the War
Department, the Ancon, went through from
ocean to ocean. The event was celebrated
locally — it was a public holiday along the
isthmus — and from New Orleans and other
cities interested in the canal and expecting to
use it and profit by it, congratulatory telegrams
poured in. The big affair will not come for
10 several months. It has been expected and
arranged for that every maritime nation should
send some of its crack men-of-war to take part
in a great naval parade through the canal next
year, and naval displays were proposed for New
15 York, New Orleans and San Francisco.
Invitations had been extended to all countries,
and even Switzerland had been asked to have
some vessel as its representative at Panama.
What the celebration will be in the face of
20 present European conditions, it is impossible to
say. It may be confined to our own fleet and

international display as had been planned and as

25 that attending the opening of the Suez Canal.
Europe will be tired out, with no fever of
festival and no desire for naval demonstrations.
In the meanwhile, although the canal is now
open, and vessels can operate through it, the
30 government will continue to improve, to deepen
it for larger vessels, and to make it wider,
especially at the Culebra cut, which has been
the most difficult portion of the canal from the
very beginning.
35
Because of the European trouble and the
generally demoralized condition of the world’s
merchant marine, the canal will not be used for
commerce at the start to the extent that we had
hoped for, and it will not be fair to take the first
40 few months’ form as giving any idea what it
will do. It is probable that a very large amount
of the steamship tonnage going through the
canal will be American coastwise vessels
running between our Pacific and the Atlantic
45 and Gulf coasts. It fills the bill to know that
