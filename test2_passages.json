    "passage_text": "Mouth music is the name given in English to the many ways <u id=\"q1\">by</u> imitating the sounds of musical instruments with the human voice. Forms of mouth music are performed around the world, but the genre <u id=\"q2\">being</u> particularly popular in England, Ireland, and Scotland. In this Celtic region, <i> lilting and jigging </i> are two of the lively names used to refer to this musical form.\r\n\r\nCeltic mouth music exists to accompany dancing, so the rhythms and sounds are <u id=\"q3\">first-class and the words take a back seat</u>. Instead of using traditional lyrics, singers often produce nonsense <u id=\"q4\">syllables called vocables</u> to represent specific instrumental sounds, such as those of bagpipes or violins. The results are songs that rarely make literal sense but nevertheless flow in a way <u id=\"q5\">easier </u> to dance to.\r\n\r\nOne Scottish form of mouth music, <i>puirt-a-beul,</i> is performed entirely in the Gaelic language and accompanies traditional dance steps. <u id=\"q6\">The often tongue-twisting </u> lyrics require much practice to perfect. The greater challenge for many puirt-a-beul singers, <u id=\"q7\">though</u>, is learning when to breathe. A poorly timed breath might break a song's flow, interrupting the steady beat <u id=\"q8\"> it relies </u> on to help time their steps.\r\n\r\n<u id=\"q9\"> </u> Instruments were prohibitively expensive and thus scarce in isolated Scottish <u id=\"q10\">in villages</u> order to fill the void, mouth music emerged and provided residents with the music they wanted for dancing. Additionally, puirt-a-beul gave anyone <u id=\"q11\">whomever</u> didn't read music a way to learn and pass on traditional songs.\r\n\r\nThe continuing popularity of Celtic mouth music is testament to the vitality of <u id=\"q12\">them</u>. In the 1990s, groups like Mouth Music from Scotland and The Cranberries from Ireland rose to fame, <u id=\"q13\">exposing with audiences Celtic mouth music worldwide</u>. The bands' celebrity <u id=\"q14\"> continually survives </u> as they <u id=\"q15\"> combine traditional mouth music with modern rhythms.</u>",

Beginning around 500 BCE, they built towns and villages, <u id=\"q17\">cloth was manufactured there </u> and jewelry, and traded throughout North Africa and the Mediterranean. They also grew a variety of crops, including wheat, dates, palms, grapes, figs and melons. <u id=\"q18\">  </u>\r\n\r\nThe survival of their civilization depended on hundreds of miles of underground tunnels. These tunnels carried water to desert settlements from an aquifer, an underground water source, <u id=\"q19\"> in the distant mountains,</u>.\r\n\r\nThe water ran through sloping, <u id=\"q20\"> hand-dug </u> tunnels called foggaras, which could be as deep as one hundred thirty feet below ground, These tunnels were connected to the surface by ventilation shafts ever thirty feet or so.\r\n\r\nWhen the tunnels reached a town or field, the water flowed into <u id=\"q21\">more easy accessible</u> surface canals or reservoirs. <u id=\"q22\">Having left no clues, archaeologists</u> don't know how the Garamantes learned to build foggaras. Other such tunnels existed in Iran, Algeria, Tunisia, and elsewhere. \r\n\r\nBecause the canals were underground, the water they carried stayed clean and didn’t evaporate. And because the water came from an aquifer rather <u id=\"q23\">then from its</u> rainfall, the supply was unaffected by drought. The Garamantes <u id=\"q24\">could of relied</u> on a constant supply of water for drinking, washing, and irrigation. <u id=\"q25\">Moreover,</u> the cold, damp air of the foggaras lowered the temperature inside the homes that were built over them, resulting in an ancient form of air-conditioning. \r\n\r\nThe Garamantes <u id=\"q26\">who</u> thrived until about 500 CE, when some archaeologists believe they began to deplete the aquifer. <u id=\"q27\">As</u> the foggaras supplied less and less water, the Garamantes’ population <u id=\"q28\">declined, their</u> civilization eventually collapsed.

Neutrinos carry no electrical charge, are practically weightless, and travel at nearly the speed of light.
