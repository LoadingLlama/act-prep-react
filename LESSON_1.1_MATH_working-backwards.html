<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Working backwards</strong> is one of the most powerful problem-solving strategies on the ACT Math test, allowing you to solve complex problems by <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">reverse-engineering</strong> the solution from the answer choices. Instead of setting up algebraic equations and solving forward, you <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">test each answer choice</strong> by substituting it into the problem to see which one works. This strategy is particularly effective for <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">word problems</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">multi-step equations</strong>, and situations where the algebraic setup is unclear or time-consuming.

1. When to Work Backwards
</h3>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Identifying Appropriate Problems
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
Working backwards is most effective when:
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>The problem asks "which value" or "what number":</strong> Questions that ask you to find a specific numerical value are perfect candidates for testing answer choices.
</p>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">
<strong>Example:</strong> "When 5 is added to twice a number, the result is 23. What is the number?"
<br><br>
Instead of solving 2x + 5 = 23 algebraically, you can test each answer choice by substituting it for "the number."
</p>
</div>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Answer choices are simple numbers:</strong> When answer choices are concrete values (not variables or expressions), you can easily test each one.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>The algebraic setup is complex or unclear:</strong> Some word problems involve multiple steps or relationships that are easier to check than to set up formally.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Testing is faster than solving:</strong> For some problems, plugging in numbers and checking is quicker than working through the algebra, especially under time pressure.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
When NOT to Work Backwards
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
This strategy is less effective when:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7;">
<li><strong>Answer choices are variables or expressions:</strong> You can't substitute expressions easily, so algebraic solving is necessary</li>
<li><strong>The problem is simple and direct:</strong> Basic one-step or two-step problems are faster to solve conventionally</li>
<li><strong>Testing would be very time-consuming:</strong> If checking each answer involves extensive calculation, direct solving may be more efficient</li>
<li><strong>The question asks "all of the following EXCEPT":</strong> You'd need to test all five choices rather than stopping when you find one that works</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Strategic Answer Choice Selection
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
When working backwards, you don't always need to test all five answer choices. Use this strategic approach:
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Start with choice C (the middle value):</strong> Answer choices are typically arranged in numerical order. If you test C and it's too large or too small, you can eliminate C and either A & B or D & E based on whether you need a bigger or smaller value.
</p>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">
<strong>Example:</strong> Answer choices are A. 3  B. 5  C. 7  D. 9  E. 11
<br><br>
Test C (7) first. If 7 is too small, eliminate A, B, and C—the answer must be D or E. Now you only need to test one more choice to find the answer.
</p>
</div>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Test easy-to-calculate values first:</strong> If one answer choice is particularly simple (like 0, 1, or 10), it might be worth testing first for quick elimination.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Stop when you find one that works:</strong> Once an answer choice satisfies all conditions in the problem, that's your answer—no need to test the remaining choices.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Step-by-Step Process
</h3>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Reading the Problem Carefully
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
Before testing answer choices, ensure you understand what the problem requires:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7;">
<li><strong>Identify what you're solving for:</strong> What does the question ask? A number, a measurement, a price?</li>
<li><strong>Note all conditions:</strong> List every constraint or relationship the correct answer must satisfy</li>
<li><strong>Understand the operations:</strong> What happens to the value in the problem? Is it doubled, increased, multiplied?</li>
<li><strong>Check units:</strong> Are answers in dollars, hours, feet? Ensure you're testing correctly</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Testing an Answer Choice
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
Follow this systematic process when testing each choice:
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Step 1: Assume the answer choice is correct.</strong> Substitute the value everywhere the unknown appears in the problem.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Step 2: Work through the problem step-by-step.</strong> Follow the sequence of operations described, calculating what would happen if this value were the answer.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Step 3: Check the final result.</strong> Does your calculation match what the problem says should happen? Does it satisfy all conditions?
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Step 4: Accept or eliminate.</strong> If all conditions are satisfied, you've found the answer. If not, eliminate this choice and test another.
</p>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">
<strong>Complete example:</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>Problem:</strong> Sarah has some money. If she spends $15 and then triples what remains, she'll have $60. How much money did Sarah start with?
<br><br>
A. $20<br>
B. $25<br>
C. $30<br>
D. $35<br>
E. $40
<br><br>
<strong>Testing choice C ($30):</strong>
<br>
Step 1: Assume Sarah starts with $30
<br>
Step 2: She spends $15: $30 - $15 = $15 remains
<br>
Step 3: She triples what remains: $15 × 3 = $45
<br>
Step 4: Check: Does she have $60? No, she has $45. ❌ Eliminate C.
<br><br>
$45 is less than the required $60, so we need Sarah to start with more money. Eliminate A, B, and C.
<br><br>
<strong>Testing choice D ($35):</strong>
<br>
Step 1: Assume Sarah starts with $35
<br>
Step 2: She spends $15: $35 - $15 = $20 remains
<br>
Step 3: She triples what remains: $20 × 3 = $60
<br>
Step 4: Check: Does she have $60? Yes! ✓
<br><br>
<strong>Answer: D</strong>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Organizing Your Work
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
When working backwards, stay organized to avoid errors:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7;">
<li><strong>Write down what you're testing:</strong> Note "Testing C: 7" so you don't lose track</li>
<li><strong>Show each calculation step:</strong> Write out the arithmetic for each operation in sequence</li>
<li><strong>Check all conditions:</strong> Some problems have multiple requirements—verify each one</li>
<li><strong>Mark eliminated choices:</strong> Cross out choices you've ruled out to avoid re-testing them</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
This systematic approach prevents calculation errors and helps you work efficiently.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Common Problem Types
</h3>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Age Problems
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
Age problems describe relationships between people's ages and are ideal for working backwards:
</p>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">
<strong>Problem:</strong> Marcus is 3 years older than twice his sister's age. If Marcus is 19, how old is his sister?
<br><br>
F. 7<br>
G. 8<br>
H. 9<br>
J. 10<br>
K. 11
<br><br>
<strong>Testing H (9):</strong>
<br>
- Sister's age: 9
<br>
- Twice sister's age: 9 × 2 = 18
<br>
- 3 years older than that: 18 + 3 = 21
<br>
- Check: Is Marcus 19? No, we got 21. ❌
<br><br>
21 > 19, so the sister must be younger than 9. Eliminate H, J, K.
<br><br>
<strong>Testing G (8):</strong>
<br>
- Sister's age: 8
<br>
- Twice sister's age: 8 × 2 = 16
<br>
- 3 years older than that: 16 + 3 = 19
<br>
- Check: Is Marcus 19? Yes! ✓
<br><br>
<strong>Answer: G</strong>
</p>
</div>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Consecutive Integer Problems
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
Problems about consecutive integers (like n, n+1, n+2) or consecutive even/odd integers work well with this strategy:
</p>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">
<strong>Problem:</strong> The sum of three consecutive even integers is 84. What is the smallest of these integers?
<br><br>
A. 26<br>
B. 27<br>
C. 28<br>
D. 29<br>
E. 30
<br><br>
<strong>Testing C (28):</strong>
<br>
- First integer: 28
<br>
- Consecutive even integers: 28, 30, 32
<br>
- Sum: 28 + 30 + 32 = 90
<br>
- Check: Is the sum 84? No, we got 90. ❌
<br><br>
90 > 84, so we need smaller integers. Eliminate C, D, E.
<br><br>
<strong>Testing A (26):</strong>
<br>
- First integer: 26
<br>
- Consecutive even integers: 26, 28, 30
<br>
- Sum: 26 + 28 + 30 = 84
<br>
- Check: Is the sum 84? Yes! ✓
<br><br>
<strong>Answer: A</strong>
</p>
</div>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Number Property Problems
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
Problems describing relationships between a number and its operations (doubling, squaring, adding) are perfect for testing:
</p>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">
<strong>Problem:</strong> When a number is decreased by 8 and the result is multiplied by 4, the final answer is 28. What is the original number?
<br><br>
F. 9<br>
G. 11<br>
H. 13<br>
J. 15<br>
K. 17
<br><br>
<strong>Testing H (13):</strong>
<br>
- Original number: 13
<br>
- Decreased by 8: 13 - 8 = 5
<br>
- Multiplied by 4: 5 × 4 = 20
<br>
- Check: Is the result 28? No, we got 20. ❌
<br><br>
20 < 28, so we need a larger original number. Eliminate F, G, H.
<br><br>
<strong>Testing J (15):</strong>
<br>
- Original number: 15
<br>
- Decreased by 8: 15 - 8 = 7
<br>
- Multiplied by 4: 7 × 4 = 28
<br>
- Check: Is the result 28? Yes! ✓
<br><br>
<strong>Answer: J</strong>

Percent and Money Problems
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
Problems involving discounts, tips, taxes, or percent changes often work well with this approach:
</p>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">
<strong>Problem:</strong> After a 20% discount, a jacket costs $64. What was the original price?
<br><br>
A. $76.80<br>
B. $80.00<br>
C. $84.00<br>
D. $88.00<br>
E. $92.00
<br><br>
<strong>Testing B ($80):</strong>
<br>
- Original price: $80
<br>
- 20% discount: $80 × 0.20 = $16
<br>
- Sale price: $80 - $16 = $64
<br>
- Check: Is the sale price $64? Yes! ✓
<br><br>
<strong>Answer: B</strong>
</p>
</div>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Advanced Strategies and Tips
</h3>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Combining Working Backwards with Estimation
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
You can often narrow down answer choices before testing by estimating:
</p>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">
<strong>Problem:</strong> A number is multiplied by 7, then 5 is added. The result is 103. What is the number?
<br><br>
<strong>Estimation:</strong> The result (103) is close to 105. If we subtract 5, we get 98. What times 7 equals 98? Since 7 × 14 = 98, the answer should be around 14.
<br><br>
Look for answer choices near 14 and test those first, rather than testing from the middle.
</p>
</div>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
When You Have Multiple Conditions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
Some problems require the answer to satisfy two or more separate conditions:
</p>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">
<strong>Problem:</strong> A number is divisible by both 4 and 6, and it's between 20 and 40. What could the number be?
<br><br>
<strong>Strategy:</strong> Test each answer choice against BOTH conditions:
<br>
1. Is it divisible by 4? (Check: does it divide evenly by 4?)
<br>
2. Is it divisible by 6? (Check: does it divide evenly by 6?)
<br>
3. Is it between 20 and 40?
<br><br>
The correct answer must satisfy all three conditions.
</p>
</div>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
Check the easiest condition first to eliminate choices quickly, then verify remaining conditions.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Avoiding Common Mistakes
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
When working backwards, watch out for these errors:
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Mistake 1: Following the wrong order of operations.</strong> Carefully track the sequence described in the problem. "5 less than twice a number" means 2n - 5, not 5 - 2n.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Mistake 2: Stopping too soon.</strong> Ensure you've completed all steps before checking the final result. If the problem describes three operations, perform all three.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Mistake 3: Misreading what you're solving for.</strong> Double-check that the question asks for the value you're testing. If it asks for "Sarah's age in 5 years," don't test her current age.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Mistake 4: Arithmetic errors.</strong> Work carefully through calculations. A small arithmetic mistake can lead you to eliminate the correct answer.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Time Management
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
Working backwards should save time, not cost it:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7;">
<li><strong>Set a time limit:</strong> If testing the first two choices takes longer than expected, consider switching to algebraic solving</li>
<li><strong>Use strategic choice selection:</strong> Starting with the middle value and eliminating half the choices makes this strategy more efficient</li>
<li><strong>Don't overthink:</strong> If a choice clearly doesn't work, move on quickly rather than double-checking</li>
<li><strong>Practice mental math:</strong> The faster you can calculate in your head, the more efficient this strategy becomes</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
When to Switch Strategies
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
Be flexible. If working backwards isn't efficient for a particular problem, switch to algebraic solving:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7;">
<li>If testing two choices takes more than 30 seconds total, the algebra might be faster</li>
<li>If the calculations when testing are complex or error-prone, set up an equation instead</li>
<li>If you realize you need to test all five choices (rare), algebraic solving will be faster</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
The goal is to solve problems correctly and efficiently—use whichever method best accomplishes that for each specific question.
</p>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">
<strong>Final Example (Multi-step problem):</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>Problem:</strong> A store increases a shirt's price by 25%, then offers a 20% discount on the new price. If the final price is $30, what was the original price?
<br><br>
A. $25<br>
B. $30<br>
C. $32<br>
D. $35<br>
E. $40
<br><br>
<strong>Testing C ($32):</strong>
<br>
- Original price: $32
<br>
- Increase by 25%: $32 × 1.25 = $40
<br>
- 20% discount on $40: $40 × 0.80 = $32
<br>
- Check: Is the final price $30? No, we got $32. ❌
<br><br>
$32 > $30, so we need a smaller original price. Eliminate C, D, E.
<br><br>
<strong>Testing A ($25):</strong>
<br>
- Original price: $25
<br>
- Increase by 25%: $25 × 1.25 = $31.25
<br>
- 20% discount on $31.25: $31.25 × 0.80 = $25
<br>
- Check: Is the final price $30? No, we got $25. ❌
<br><br>
<strong>Testing B ($30):</strong>
<br>
- Original price: $30
<br>
- Increase by 25%: $30 × 1.25 = $37.50
<br>
- 20% discount on $37.50: $37.50 × 0.80 = $30
<br>
- Check: Is the final price $30? Yes! ✓
<br><br>
