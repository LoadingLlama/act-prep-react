Chapter 12: Transitions
The ACT tests your reading comprehension skills by asking you to select the correct transition. All of the
answer choices in these questions will be grammatically correct, so you are being tested on your ability
to read for context and select the correct transition.
To answer these questions, you should use the following approach:
1.

Ignore the transition currently in the passage. Cover up the transition word and read the
sentence(s) before and after without the transition.
Determine the relationship between the sentences.
Look at the answer choices and select the transition that correctly relates the ideas. Some
questions have an option with no transition. If no transition is necessary, select the option with
no transition.

There are two types of transitions questions:
1.

All 4 answer choices are transitions. If all 4 answer choices are a transition, you are only being
tested on selecting the correct transition. These questions look like this:

From a distance, the ocean looked pretty calm

1.

Which transition word is the most logical

today even though a storm had arrived last

in context?

night. Under the circumstances, the scene

A. NO CHANGE

was much more chaotic with big waves and

B. For instance,

strong riptides.

C. Up close,
D. For example,

As we can see with the example above, all 4 answer choices are grammatically correct. If we only read
the second sentence, there is no way to know which answer choice is correct. Once we read the
sentences together, it becomes obvious that C is correct. Since the previous sentence started with

“from a distance,” we need to transition to the second sentence of “up close.”
2.

3 answer choices are transitions, and 1 has no transition. If we see a question like this, the
ACT is asking us to consider which transition is correct and whether a transition is even necessary.
Most often, the correct answer is the one that takes away the transition entirely.

Stepping out on the island’s port on

Which transition word, if any, is the most

Monday, the new couple debuted their

logical in context?

own classic take on beach attire. As
a

result, the actor opted for a classic white

B. In other words, the

tee and board shorts while his model

C. Consequently, the

counterpart wore a floral print coverup

D. The

and strappy sandals.

In this example, there is no transition necessary, so the correct answer is “D.” Whenever faced with
whether the transition is necessary or not, ask yourself if the transition properly links the sentences.
Again, to do this properly, you must read for context.
