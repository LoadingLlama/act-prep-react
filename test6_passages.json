    "passage_text": "US history books have traditionally chronicled the actions of male Revolutionary War <u id=\"q1\">heroes such as</u> George Washington, Paul Revere, and John Paul Jones. Increasingly, such books include accounts of the many brave women <u id=\"q2\">which</u> also contributed—as spies and soldiers—to the effort to gain independence from British rule. \r\n\r\nDeborah Sampson of Plympton, Massachusetts, was <u id=\"q3\"> one of these women.</u>. In 1782, <u id=\"q4\">despite the fact that</u> women weren't allowed to serve in the military, twenty-one-year-old Sampson joined the colonial army. She disguised herself as a man and enlisted under the name of Robert Shurtliff.\r\n\r\n<u id=\"q5\">For fourteen months Sampson served in the army, </u> she acted with exceptional bravery and fortitude. Her commanding officers quickly recognized these traits and sent her on several special missions. On <u id=\"q6\">one such</u> mission near West Point, New York, Sampson was part of a scouting party <u id=\"q7\">whose assignment </u> to track and capture a British convoy. While pursuing several British soldiers into a swamp, Sampson was shot in the leg. Fearing that her true identity would be discovered, she did not report to the hospital. Instead, Sampson removed the musket ball by herself.\r\n\r\nOn another scouting mission, <u id=\"q8\">Sampsons' party,</u> was ambushed by British soldiers. To <u id=\"q9\">escape the scouts</u> had to <u id=\"q10\"> wade across a river.</u> A fierce current swept Sampson into deep waters. <u id=\"q11\">It was the weight of</u> her heavy backpack and musket, Sampson struggled. <u id=\"q12\">For instance, a</u> colonial soldier standing on a sandbar threw her a rope. Summoning her strength, Sampson <u id=\"q13\">plucked from the air that which was to save her</u> and made it to shore.[A] \r\n\r\nSampson survived the winter and spring with her secret undiscovered. [B] In July 1783, however, she was found out. [C] While this meant that she could no longer\r\nserve in the army, her exemplary record as a soldier was officially recognized. [D] Later, she was awarded a military <u id=\"q14\">pension as</u> a sign of gratitude from the young nation she had helped found.",

Transmitted over telegraph wire or radio waves via pulses of electric current, Morse <u id=\"q46\">code, which was used</u> for over a century, the standard for rapid long-distance communication, especially for those at sea.[A] In 1995, however, the US Coast Guard suspended <u id=\"q47\">it's usage</u> of Morse code, including the international distress signal SOS. <u id=\"q48\">Despite</u> the speed and precision of technologies such as global positioning satellites, decoding signals in Morse code had become inefficient. \r\n\r\n\r\nTo some, the decision <u id=\"q49\">signaled the end of</u> Morse code. <u id=\"q50\"> </u> Morse code’s enduring utility, they argue, <u id=\"q51\">lays in the fact that it functions less like a technology then</u> a language—one that can reliably transmit a message under almost any conditions.[B] \r\n\r\nIn Morse code, each letter of the <u id=\"q52\">unique</u> Roman alphabet consists of a pattern of short and long signals called dots and dashes.[C] Though <u id=\"q53\">Morse code was used longer than any electrical coding system,</u> spelling out and translating messages in Morse code does not require specialized machines. Messages can be transmitted by clicking a flashlight on and off, <u id=\"q54\">by flashing a mirror in the sun,</u> or simply blinking. [D] The code can also be spoken aloud, with the words <i>dit</i> and <i>dah</i> substituted for dots and dashes, or rendered rhythmically, allowing people to communicate via handheld buzzers.\r\n\r\n<u id=\"q55\">Because of its versatility,</u> Morse code can prove valuable in ensuring public safety when more sophisticated equipment fails. Similarly, amateur radio operators can use the code during weather emergencies to solicit information from outside the affected area. The <u id=\"q56\"> news is relayed by them, by which they</u> can keep people safe and informed. <u id=\"q57\"> </u> New communication technologies will continue to emerge, <u id=\"q58\">meanwhile</u> Morse code, with its lack of sophistication, could remain just as effective an asset.",

Under the cover of the night sky, Banksy worked quickly and steadily, sometimes painting freehand, sometimes spray-painting elaborately detailed stencils. <u id=\"q67\">  </u>  \r\n\r\nConcerned residents argued that Banksy's work was simply graffiti that encouraged vandalism. <u id=\"q68\">that</u> encouraged vandalism.

Seemingly <u id=\"q72\">he is</u> everywhere and nowhere at once, Banksy had the full attention of the art world. Museum directors organized Banksy exhibitions, and <u id=\"q73\">auctioneers sold actual pieces of buildings</u> that bore Banksy's artistry. In Banksy's own words, \r\n\r\nDespite his popularity, Banksy has not given in to the hype. He does not reproduce and sell prints of his images for profit. He also continues to communicate with the public through his street art, which is possible in part because he has managed to keep his identity secret.
