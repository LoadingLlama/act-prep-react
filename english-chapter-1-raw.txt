Chapter 1: Sentence Structure
To conquer the ACT English Test, we first need to be able to identify the different parts of a sentence and
know the rules for how they can and cannot be combined.

Clauses and Phrases
A clause is a group of words that contains both a subject and a verb. There are two types of clauses:
independent clauses and dependent clauses.
An independent clause can stand as a sentence by itself. It always has a subject and a verb. The best
way to identify an independent clause is to read the sentence and see if you can stop talking at the end.
If you can stop, it is a complete sentence and an independent clause. Here are some examples of
independent clauses:
The dog chased its tail.
Monique made some homemade peach scones for breakfast.
He picked it up.
The excited child opened up his present.
A dependent clause cannot stand alone as a complete sentence. Most often, clauses become dependent
by adding a subordinating conjunction to the front of the clause. The most common subordinating
conjunctions are listed below
after

in order to

whatever

although

once

when

as

since

whenever

because

though

whether

before

that

where

even though

unless

while

if

until

Notice how in the examples below these words turn independent clauses into dependent clauses:
While the dog chased its tail...
Although Monique made some homemade peach scones for breakfast...
Since he picked it up...
When the excited child opened up his present...
A phrase lacks a subject or verb or both. A phrase does not express a complete thought and can never
stand alone as asentence. As aresult, phrases provide additional descriptory information in a sentence.
Chasing its tail...
Making some homemade peach scones for breakfast...
Picking it up...
Excited to open up his present...
All of these example are missing the subject. From the phrase alone, we do not know who is doing any of
these actions.

TIP - Independent Clauses vs. Dependent Clauses vs. Phrases
To tell the difference between an independent clause, a dependent clause, and a phrase, read the

sentence out loud (or “out loud” in your head). If you can stop talking at the end of the sentence,
it is an independent clause. If you feel like you need to Keep talking, the sentence is a dependent
clause or a phrase and cannot stand alone.
To tell the difference between a dependent clause and a phrase, cover the first word and read
the rest of the sentence. If you then have a complete sentence, it is a dependent clause. If you do
not have a complete sentence, it is a phrase.
Independent Clause:

My brother Adam eats cookies every day.

Dependent Clause:

When my brother Adam eats cookies every day...

Phrase:

Eating cookies everyday...

Exercise: For each of the clauses or phrases below, identify if it is an independent clause (I), dependent
clause (D), or phrase (P). Write I, D, or P next to each question.
1) Areference to Canadian politics in the 1980s
2) The new clothing brand that makes clothing entirely from recycled plastic bottles is popular
3) He created the new pair of shoes specifically for a special client with size 17 feet
4) Because the water bottle was manufactured with two layers of stainless steel
5) Iluminating the crime scene with a flashlight
6) Forgetting his calculator at home was a big mistake
7) Even though potted succulents grow far better in summer than winter
8) Running out of time to complete his sculpture for the spring art show
9) With no regard for his own health and safety
10) Rain is in the forecast for the next three days
11) Expertly kneaded bread will have air pockets
12) Hiking fifteen miles in a single day with only three liters of water and a small bag of trail mix
13) While Manu was accused of cheating by both the teachers and all of the students
14) Where Stephanie’s campaign for class president relied on donations from classmates

Sentence Fragments
A complete sentence must contain a subject and a verb. Sentence fragments are missing a subject or a
verb or both and do not express a complete thought. In other words, a sentence fragment cannot
stand by itself. To spot sentence fragments, read the entire sentence. The sentence will usually just
sound plain wrong, and you will realize it is missing a subject or a verb.
Incorrect: The student running to get to class on time. (missing a verb - what did the student do?)
Correct: The student running to get to class on time dropped her water bottle.
Incorrect: Excited to go to the beach and surf. (missing a subject - who is excited to go to the beach?)
Correct: My little brother Shaun is excited to go to the beach and surf.

5 Types of Compound Sentences
Often on the ACT, we often face more complex sentences that have multiple clauses (more than one
subject and verb). These are called compound sentences. On the ACT (and in English in general),
multiple clauses must always appear as one of the 5 types below.
1.

Two separate independent clauses with periods.
Mary loves dogs.

Andrew loves cats.

Independent

2. Comma + FANBOYS joining 2 independent clauses. a For
Mary loves dogs , and Andrew loves cats.
Independent

3. Semicolon between 2 independent clauses.

special words!

* A semicolon is the same a period on the ACT.
4.

Dependent clause followed by independent clause (comma).
While Mary loves dogs , Andrew loves cats.
Dependent

5.

Independent

Independent clause straight into dependent clause (no comma).
Mary loves dogs while Andrew loves cats.

You need to memorize these 5 rules! The ACT will challenge you by putting answer choices that

“look” or “sound” good on the exam but actually break one of our rules above. Next, we will cover the
most common comma mistake students make with sentence structure.

Comma Splice
A comma by itself CANNOT be used to join two independent clauses. Joining two independent
sentences with only a comma is called a comma splice and is always incorrect.
Incorrect: It is believed that bulls are enraged by the color red, they are actually colorblind.
Incorrect: I cannot believe you did not get the flowers, I left them at your front door.
Both of these sentences are comma splices. We can correct these comma splices using any of our 5
comma rules above. The first incorrect sentence is corrected below using all 5 rules.
Rule #1: Itis believed that bulls are enraged by the color red. They are actually colorblind.
Rule #2: It is believed that bulls are enraged by the color red, but they are actually colorblind.
Rule #3: Itis believed that bulls are enraged by the color red; they are actually colorblind.
Rule #4: While it is believed that bulls are enraged by the color red, they are actually colorblind.
Rule #5: Itis believed that bulls are enraged by the color red though they are actually colorblind.

TIP - How to Spot Sentence Structure Questions
Sentence structure questions usually have at least one of the following characteristics:
1.

Period, semicolons, commas, and FANBOYS are in the answer choices. If you see
answer choices with any of these, you are most likely looking at a sentence structure
question.

2.

Some answer choices have a subject or verb and others do not. For more advanced
sentence structure questions, some answer choices have subjects or verbs while others do
not. The verbs may also vary in their forms; for example, one answer choice may say

“drove” while another says “driving”. For these questions, be on the lookout for comma
splices.
On the ACT, sentence structure questions commonly look like this:
The roller coaster is opening next

1.

Which choice makes the sentence most

week, the wait time is expected to be

grammatically acceptable:

over 4 hours long.

A.

NO CHANGE

B.

week; with the

C.

week and the

D.

week. The

?

In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit

2.

Which choice makes the sentence

New Orleans; resulting in over 1,800

most grammatically acceptable?

deaths and $125 billion in damage.

A.

NO CHANGE

B.

New Orleans, the result was

C.

New Orleans, and the result was

D.

New Orleans. The result being

Anytime you spot a sentence structure question, use the following approach:

1.

Find where the sentence is being “split.”

2.

Look left and right of the “split” point and identify the clauses or phrases.

3.

Apply the sentence structure rules.

In the first example above, the answer is D because we have two independent clauses. A is a comma
splice. In B, the second half is not an independent clause. C is missing the comma with the
FANBOYS.

In the second example, the answer is C because we have two independent clauses linked by a comma
+ FANBOYS. A and D are incorrect because the second half
is not an independent clause. Bisa

comma splice.
