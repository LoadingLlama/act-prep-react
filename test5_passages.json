    "passage_text": "In 1948, graduate <u id=\"q1\">students, Norman Woodland and Bernard Silver,</u> took on a problem that had troubled retailers for years: how to keep track of store inventories. Inspired by the dots and dashes of Morse code, <u id=\"q2\">however,</u> Woodland and Silver created a system of lines that could encode data. Called a <i> symbology, </i> the pattern created by the spacing and widths of the lines encodes information by representing different characters.\r\n\r\nThe first bar code was composed of four white lines set at specific <u id=\"q3\">distances from each </u> other on a black background. The first line was always present. <u id=\"q4\">  </u> Depending on the presence or absence of the remaining three lines, up to seven different arrangements were <u id=\"q5\">susceptible</u> and, therefore, seven different encodings. \r\n\r\n\r\nToday, twenty-nine white lines <u id=\"q6\">making</u> more than half a billion encodings possible. \r\n\r\nTo create a bar code scanner, Woodland and Silver adapted technology from an optical movie sound system. Their prototype scanner used a 500-watt bulb, a photomultiplier tube (a device that detects light), and an oscilloscope (a device that translates electronic signals into readable information). Although successful, the <u id=\"q7\">concoction</u> was both large and costly. <u id=\"q8\">For example,</u> progress stalled until the 1970s, when laser technology (both more compact and less expensive) became available.\r\n\r\nIn today’s scanners, a laser sends light back and forth across a bar code. While the black lines absorb the light, the white lines reflect <u id=\"q9\">it</u> back at a fixed mirror inside the scanner. In this way, the scanner reads the symbology and decodes the information. <u id=\"q10\"> </u>\r\n\r\n<u id=\"q11\">being that there are</u> one- and two-dimensional bar codes using numeric and alphanumeric symbologies. Bar codes are used not only for a pack of gum or an airline ticket, but also for research. In one study, for instance, tiny bar codes <u id=\"q12\">were placed on bees tracking</u> their activities. Shaping the way we gather, track, and share information, <u id=\"q13\">we have almost certainly exceeded even Woodland and Silver’s expectations.</u>",

An <u id=\"q65\">eminent scientist and bureaucrat named Su Song lead</u> Zhezong's ambitious project. \r\n\r\n<u id=\"q66\">Using his expertise in calendrical science,</u> Su Song created a spectacular timepiece <u id=\"q67\">housed within</u> an ornate forty-foot-tall tower. At the tower’s top sat an armillary <u id=\"q68\">sphere, or</u> a nest of metal rings representing celestial reference points such as the horizon and the sun’s path—that rotated in sync with the earth, enabling precise astronomical observations. Inside the tower, a sphere depicting the sky revolved to display the stars that were overhead.\r\n\r\n<u id=\"q69\">Besides,</u> below the star sphere, the tower’s open sides exposed a detailed model of a five-story pagoda. Automated figurines would appear in the pagoda’s doorways and ring <u id=\"q70\">bells to announce</u> hours, sunsets,seasons, and other chronological events.\r\n\r\nThe clock’s inner workings <u id=\"q71\">were</u> equally remarkable. Hidden in the tower, a waterwheel eleven feet in diameter powered the entire clock. <u id=\"q72\">Therefore, water</u> would pour at a constant rate into one of the wheel’s thirty-six buckets. When the bucket was full, the water’s weight pulled it down, rotating the waterwheel. Then a stop mechanism halted the wheel and positioned the next bucket for filling. Chinese clockmakers had long used waterwheels, <u id=\"q73\"> but </u> Su Song’s stop mechanism, which regulated the inertia of the waterwheel, represented significant innovation. Unfortunately, after Su Song’s clock ran for thirty years, invaders stole it. Later the clock vanished altogether. It would be a few hundred years <u id=\"q74\">until with the refinement of mechanical clocks in Europe</u> other clocks <u id=\"q75\">approached the complexity</u> of Su Song's masterpiece.",
