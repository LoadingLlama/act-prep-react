<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">To conquer the ACT English Test, we first need to be able to identify the different parts of a sentence and</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">know the rules for how they can and cannot be combined.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">Clauses and Phrases</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">A clause is a group of words that contains both a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong> and a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong>. There are two types of clauses:</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">independent clauses</strong> and <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">dependent clauses</strong>.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">An <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">independent clause</strong> can stand as a sentence by itself. It always has a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong> and a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong>. The best</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">way to identify an <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">independent clause</strong> is to read the sentence and see if you can stop talking at the end.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">If you can stop, it is a complete sentence and an <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">independent clause</strong>. Here are some examples of</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">independent clauses</strong>:</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The dog chased its tail.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Monique made some homemade peach scones for breakfast.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">A <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">dependent clause</strong> cannot stand alone as a complete sentence. Most often, clauses become dependent</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">by adding a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subordinating conjunction</strong> to the front of the clause. The most common subordinating</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">conjunctions are listed below</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">after</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Notice how in the examples below these words turn <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">independent clauses</strong> into <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">dependent clauses</strong>:</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">While the dog chased its tail...</p>

These are called <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">compound sentences</strong>.

The ACT will challenge you by putting answer choices that ‚Äúlook‚Äù or ‚Äúsound‚Äù good on the exam but actually break one of our rules above. Next, we will cover the most common comma mistake students make with sentence structure. <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Comma Splice</strong> A comma by itself CANNOT be used to join two <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">independent clauses</strong>. Joining two independent sentences with only a comma is called a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">comma splice</strong> and is always incorrect. Incorrect: It is believed that bulls are enraged by the color red, they are actually colorblind. Incorrect: I cannot believe you did not get the flowers, I left them at your front door. Both of these sentences are <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">comma splices</strong>. We can correct these <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">comma splices</strong> using any of our 5 comma rules above. The first incorrect sentence is corrected below using all 5 rules. Rule #1: Itis believed that bulls are enraged by the color red. They are actually colorblind. Rule #2: It is believed that bulls are enraged by the color red, but they are actually colorblind. Rule #3: Itis believed that bulls are enraged by the color red; they are actually colorblind. Rule #4: While it is believed that bulls are enraged by the color red, they are actually colorblind. Rule #5: Itis believed that bulls are enraged by the color red though they are actually colorblind.

  <h4 style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 700; margin: 0 0 0.75rem 0; font-size: 1.1rem;">üí° TIP: How to Spot Sentence Structure Questions</h4>
  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0; color: #1e3a8a;">Sentence structure questions usually have at least one of the following characteristics: 1. Period, <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">semicolons</strong>, commas, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">FANBOYS</strong> are in the answer choices. If you see answer choices with any of these, you are most likely looking at a sentence structure question. 2. Some answer choices have a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong> or <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verb</strong> and others do not. For more advanced sentence structure questions, some answer choices have <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">subjects</strong> or <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verbs</strong> while others do not. The <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">verbs</strong> may also vary in their forms; for example, one answer choice may say ‚Äúdrove‚Äù while another says ‚Äúdriving‚Äù. For these questions, be on the lookout for <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">comma splices</strong>. On the ACT, sentence structure questions commonly look like this: The roller coaster is opening next 1. Which choice makes the sentence most week, the wait time is expected to be grammatically acceptable: over 4 hours long. A. NO CHANGE B. week; with the C. week and the D. week. The ? In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit 2. Which choice makes the sentence New Orleans; resulting in over 1,800 most grammatically acceptable? deaths and $125 billion in damage. A. NO CHANGE B. New Orleans, the result was C. New Orleans, and the result was D. New Orleans. The result being Anytime you spot a sentence structure question, use the following approach: 1. Find where the sentence is being ‚Äúsplit.‚Äù 2. Look left and right of the ‚Äúsplit‚Äù point and identify the clauses or <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">phrases</strong>. 3. Apply the sentence structure rules. In the first example above, the answer is D because we have two <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">independent clauses</strong>. A is a <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">comma splice</strong>. In B, the second half is not an <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">independent clause</strong>. C is missing the comma with the <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">FANBOYS</strong>. In the second example, the answer is C because we have two <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">independent clauses</strong> linked by a comma + <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">FANBOYS</strong>. A and D are incorrect because the second half is not an <strong style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">independent clause</strong>.
