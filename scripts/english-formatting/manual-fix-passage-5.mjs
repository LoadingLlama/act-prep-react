// Corrected Passage 5 with proper underlined portions in chronological order
const correctedPassage = `Rising sea levels <u>pose unprecedented</u><sub>1</sub> and urgent challenges for coastal communities worldwide. As ocean waters encroach steadily on shorelines, <u>towns and cities must</u><sub>2</sub> make difficult decisions about whether to defend against the advancing water, accommodate it through design changes, or retreat to higher ground entirely. Each option carries significant economic, social, and environmental implications that must be carefully considered.

Miami Beach<u>, Florida,</u><sub>3</sub> has chosen the expensive defense strategy, investing hundreds of millions of dollars in ambitious infrastructure improvements. The city installed massive pumps <u>to remove</u><sub>4</sub> floodwater from streets, <u>raised roads by several feet at great expense, and implemented</u><sub>5</sub> sophisticated drainage systems throughout the downtown area. While extremely expensive, these measures aim to <u>protect</u><sub>6</sub> valuable property values and maintain the city's economic viability as a tourist destination. <u>Critics, however,</u><sub>7</sub> question whether such substantial investments merely delay inevitable relocation rather than solving the underlying problem.

<u>By contrast</u><sub>8</sub>, the remote village of Newtok<u>, Alaska,</u><sub>9</sub> has <u>opted for</u><sub>10</sub> the difficult strategy of retreat. Thawing permafrost and relentless coastal erosion have made their current location increasingly uninhabitable. After years of difficult planning and discussion, the entire community <u>began relocating</u><sub>11</sub> to a new site nine miles inland. The process has proven emotionally difficult and financially challenging, requiring complex coordination among multiple government agencies and nonprofit organizations. Yet residents view it realistically as the only <u>viable</u><sub>12</sub> long-term solution for their survival.

<u>A third approach, accommodation, accepts that</u><sub>13</sub> water will increasingly intrude into urban spaces and designs accordingly with this reality in mind. Rotterdam in the Netherlands has <u>pioneered</u><sub>14</sub> this innovative strategy<u>, creating</u><sub>15</sub> impressive floating parks, water plazas <u>that serve as recreational</u><sub>16</sub> spaces during dry weather and retention basins during storms, and amphibious houses <u>that rise with flood</u><sub>17</sub> waters rather than fighting them. This approach works with nature rather than against it.

Experts emphasize that no single strategy suits all communities equally. Each must carefully weigh factors <u>including topography, available resources, and community values</u><sub>18</sub> when charting their path forward in an era of climate <u>uncertainty</u><sub>19</sub>.`;
