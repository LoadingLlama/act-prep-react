const correctedPassage = `Small-town Main Streets across America <u>have struggled</u><sub>1</sub> for decades as massive shopping malls and convenient online retailers <u>drew customers steadily away from traditional downtown districts</u><sub>2</sub>. Empty storefronts and fading facades became visible symbols of economic decline in countless communities. However, a growing movement <u>seeks to reverse</u><sub>3</sub> this troubling trend through creative revitalization strategies that combine economic development with community building.

<u>Rockville, a town of eight thousand residents in rural Iowa, exemplifies this promising transformation.</u><sub>4</sub> Five years ago, downtown Rockville <u>consisted</u><sub>6</sub> primarily of vacant buildings and a few struggling businesses barely hanging on. The town council partnered with <u>a nonprofit organization specializing in downtown revitalization</u><sub>7</sub> to develop solutions. Together, they developed a comprehensive plan<u> :</u><sub>8</sub> attracting new businesses with innovative incentives, improving aging infrastructure, and <u>creating</u><sub>9</sub> community gathering spaces that would draw people downtown. The town offered generous tax incentives to entrepreneurs willing to open shops downtown and commit to staying for several years. They upgraded crumbling sidewalks, installed attractive period lighting, <u>and planted trees</u><sub>10</sub> along previously barren streets. <u>Most significantly</u><sub>11</sub>, they converted an abandoned warehouse into a vibrant community center <u>hosting weekly farmers markets, monthly concerts, and seasonal festivals</u><sub>12</sub> that brought families together.

The results exceeded even optimistic expectations. Within three years, occupancy rates increased dramatically from thirty percent to eighty-five percent. New restaurants, boutiques, and art galleries opened their doors, creating both jobs and renewed energy. Property values rose substantially, generating additional tax revenue for continued improvements.<u></u><sub>13</sub> Residents reported increased pride in their community and greater civic engagement at public meetings.

While challenges certainly remain‚Äîincluding fierce competition from e-commerce and the need for ongoing investment and maintenance‚ÄîRockville's experience demonstrates convincingly that thoughtful planning and sustained community commitment can breathe new life into struggling downtown districts across America.<u></u><sub>15</sub>`;
