  const passage3 = `Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. This remarkable biochemical process occurs primarily in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where chlorophyll molecules absorb light energy. The overall equation for photosynthesis can be expressed simply: carbon dioxide plus water, in the presence of light energy, yields glucose and oxygen.

The process consists of two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (also known as the Calvin cycle). During the light-dependent reactions, which occur in the thylakoid membranes, light energy is captured and used to split water molecules. This releases oxygen as a byproduct and generates ATP and NADPH, energy-carrying molecules that fuel the next stage.

The Calvin cycle takes place in the stroma of the chloroplast. Here, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is fixed into organic molecules through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions provide the energy and electrons needed to convert carbon dioxide into glucose. This glucose serves as the primary energy source for the plant and, ultimately, for nearly all life on Earth.

Scientists have studied photosynthesis extensively due to its crucial role in sustaining life and its potential applications in renewable energy. Recent research has focused on artificial photosynthesis—attempting to mimic this natural process to create clean, sustainable fuels. Understanding the intricate mechanisms of photosynthesis not only illuminates how plants function but also offers insights into how we might address global energy challenges.`;

  const passage4 = `The Renaissance, which flourished in Europe from the 14th to the 17th century, marked a period of unprecedented cultural, artistic, and intellectual achievement. The term "renaissance" literally means "rebirth," referring to the revival of interest in classical Greek and Roman art, literature, and philosophy. This movement began in Italy, particularly in Florence, and gradually spread throughout Europe.

Artists during the Renaissance developed new techniques that revolutionized visual representation. The discovery and refinement of linear perspective allowed painters to create the illusion of three-dimensional space on flat surfaces. Masters like Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael combined technical skill with deep understanding of human anatomy, producing works of astonishing realism and emotional depth.

Beyond the visual arts, the Renaissance profoundly influenced literature, science, and philosophy. Writers such as Dante, Petrarch, and Shakespeare explored human nature and emotion with unprecedented psychological insight. Meanwhile, scientists and thinkers like Galileo and Copernicus challenged long-held beliefs about the universe, laying the groundwork for the Scientific Revolution.

The Renaissance emphasis on human potential and individual achievement—known as humanism—represented a significant shift from medieval thinking. Rather than focusing solely on religious devotion and the afterlife, Renaissance thinkers celebrated earthly existence and human capabilities. This philosophical transformation influenced not only art and literature but also education, politics, and social structures, shaping the modern Western worldview.`;

  const passage5 = `Social media has fundamentally transformed how we communicate, share information, and maintain relationships. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok have created unprecedented opportunities for connection, allowing people to stay in touch with friends and family across vast distances and to engage with communities of shared interest worldwide.

However, these benefits come with significant challenges. The constant stream of curated content can create unrealistic expectations and fuel social comparison. Studies have shown correlations between heavy social media use and increased rates of anxiety and depression, particularly among adolescents. The pressure to present a perfect online persona can be exhausting and can distort our perception of both ourselves and others.

Privacy concerns represent another major issue. Many users don't fully understand how their personal data is collected, stored, and used by social media companies. This information can be exploited for targeted advertising or, in more troubling cases, for political manipulation. The Cambridge Analytica scandal revealed how personal data from millions of Facebook users was harvested without consent and used to influence political campaigns.

Despite these concerns, social media isn't inherently good or bad—it's a tool, and like any tool, its impact depends on how we use it. By approaching these platforms mindfully, setting healthy boundaries, and critically evaluating the content we consume, we can harness their benefits while minimizing their potential harms. The key lies in maintaining awareness and intentionality in our digital lives.`;

  // PASSAGE 2: Social Science (Q11-20)
  const socialSciencePassage = `The concept of supply and demand forms the cornerstone of economic theory. Simply put, supply refers to the quantity of a good or service that producers are willing to offer at various prices, while demand represents the quantity that consumers are willing to purchase at those prices. The intersection of these two forces determines the market price and quantity sold.

When demand for a product increases—perhaps due to changing consumer preferences, rising incomes, or effective marketing—prices typically rise as well, assuming supply remains constant. Conversely, if supply increases substantially, perhaps through improved production methods or new competitors entering the market, prices generally fall. This dynamic relationship creates a self-regulating mechanism that, in theory, leads to efficient allocation of resources.

However, real-world markets rarely function with perfect efficiency. Various factors can disrupt the ideal supply-demand balance: government regulations, monopolistic practices, information asymmetries, and external costs not reflected in prices. For instance, the environmental damage caused by manufacturing a product represents a cost to society that isn't always factored into the market price.

Economists continue to study these market imperfections and debate the appropriate role of government intervention. Some argue that markets should be left largely unregulated to find their own equilibrium, while others contend that strategic regulation is necessary to correct market failures and protect consumers. Understanding supply and demand helps us analyze these debates and make informed decisions about economic policy.`;

  const humanitiesPassage = `Jazz emerged in the early 20th century as a uniquely American art form, born from the confluence of African and European musical traditions in New Orleans. The genre's development reflects the complex cultural history of the United States, particularly the experiences of African Americans who transformed their musical heritage—blues, ragtime, and spirituals—into something entirely new.

The golden age of jazz, spanning the 1920s through the 1940s, saw the rise of legendary musicians like Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and Billie Holiday. These artists didn't merely perform music; they innovated constantly, pushing the boundaries of harmony, rhythm, and improvisation. Jazz became more than entertainment—it was a form of expression, a means of asserting identity and creativity in the face of social constraints.

Improvisation stands at the heart of jazz. Unlike classical music, where performers typically follow a written score precisely, jazz musicians engage in spontaneous creation, building on melodic themes and chord progressions in real-time. This requires not only technical mastery but also deep musical intuition and the ability to listen and respond to fellow musicians. A jazz performance is a conversation, a collaborative act of creation.

Jazz has influenced virtually every subsequent genre of popular music, from rock and roll to hip-hop. Its emphasis on individual expression within a collaborative framework, its rhythmic sophistication, and its harmonic complexity continue to inspire musicians worldwide. Though it no longer dominates mainstream culture as it once did, jazz remains vital, evolving, and relevant—a testament to the enduring power of artistic innovation.`;

  // PASSAGE 4: Natural Science (Q31-40)
  const naturalSciencePassage = `The human immune system is a remarkably complex defense network that protects the body from pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. This system operates through two main branches: the innate immune response and the adaptive immune response, each employing different strategies to identify and eliminate threats.

The innate immune system provides the first line of defense. It includes physical barriers like skin and mucous membranes, as well as cellular components such as macrophages and natural killer cells that can quickly recognize and respond to common pathogen patterns. This response is rapid but relatively non-specific—it targets broad categories of invaders rather than specific pathogens.

The adaptive immune system, by contrast, takes longer to activate but provides highly specific and long-lasting protection. This system relies on lymphocytes called T cells and B cells, which can recognize specific antigens—unique molecular signatures of particular pathogens. When these cells encounter their target antigen, they multiply rapidly and mount a targeted response. Crucially, some of these cells become memory cells, remaining in the body for years or even decades and enabling faster, more effective responses to future encounters with the same pathogen. This immunological memory is the principle underlying vaccination.

Recent advances in immunology have revolutionized medicine. Immunotherapy treatments harness the immune system to fight cancer, while understanding autoimmune diseases—conditions where the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues—has led to better treatments for conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. As research continues, our growing knowledge of immunology promises new therapeutic approaches for a wide range of diseases.`;
