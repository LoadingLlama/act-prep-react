      explanation: "Option B correctly uses a semicolon to join two independent clauses. Option A creates a comma splice. Option C creates a run-on sentence. Option D unnecessarily adds 'and' when a semicolon alone is sufficient."

        { letter: "D", text: "This is a comma splice", is_correct: false }
      ],
      explanation: "Option A is correct because 'Although' makes this a dependent clause that cannot stand alone. It requires the independent clause 'the game continued' to form a complete sentence."

      sentence: "Having finished their homework, the students went to the park, they played basketball until sunset.",

      explanation: "Option B is correct. When 'however' joins two independent clauses, it requires a semicolon before and comma after. Option A creates a run-on. Options C and D create comma splices."

      sentence: "After reviewing all the evidence. The jury reached a unanimous verdict.",
      question_text: "Which choice best corrects the error?",

        { letter: "D", text: "carefully precisely, and thoroughly", is_correct: false }
      ],
      explanation: "Option B correctly uses commas to separate items in a list of three or more (listing commas rule). Each adverb should be separated by commas."

    {
      sentence: "The tall, brick, building housed the university's main offices.",
      question_text: "Which choice provides the best punctuation?",

        { letter: "D", text: "tall brick building", is_correct: false }
      ],
      explanation: "Option B is correct. Use commas between coordinate adjectives (adjectives that could be reordered). 'Tall' and 'brick' are coordinate, but 'brick' and 'building' form a compound noun, so no comma after 'brick'."
    },
    {
      sentence: "Dr. Johnson the renowned physicist gave a lecture on quantum mechanics.",
      question_text: "Which choice provides the best punctuation?",
      underlined: "Johnson the renowned physicist gave",

        { letter: "D", text: "Johnson, the renowned physicist gave", is_correct: false }
      ],
      explanation: "Option B correctly uses the 'names rule' - unnecessary information about a name requires commas on both sides. 'The renowned physicist' provides extra information about Dr. Johnson."

      sentence: "The conference will be held in Chicago Illinois on March 15 2024.",
      question_text: "Which choice provides the best punctuation?",

        { letter: "D", text: "Chicago Illinois, on March 15, 2024", is_correct: false }
      ],
      explanation: "Option B is correct. Cities and states require a comma between them AND after the state. Dates require commas between day and year AND after the year if the sentence continues."
    },

      sentence: "After studying all night, the student felt prepared, confident, and ready to take the exam.",

        { letter: "D", text: "enthusiastic, young talented", is_correct: false }
      ],
      explanation: "Option B is correct. All three adjectives are coordinate (you could reorder them) and modify 'musician' equally, so commas are needed between each pair."
