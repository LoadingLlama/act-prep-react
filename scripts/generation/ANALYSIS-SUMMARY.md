## ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. English Questions (21-30) Have Placeholder Text
**Status**: ❌ CRITICAL

Questions 21-30 contain generic placeholders like:
- "Alternative for Q41"
- "Another option 42"

These need to be replaced with authentic ACT-style questions matching the real pattern.

### 2. All Question Text Too Short
**Status**: ❌ CRITICAL

Our generated questions are **approximately 50% shorter** than real ACT questions across all sections:
- English stems: 8 words vs 19 words needed
- Math questions: 13 words vs 33 words needed
- Reading questions: 15 words vs 25 words needed
- Science questions: 12 words vs 22 words needed

### 3. English Choices Too Brief
**Status**: ❌ CRITICAL

Our choices average **2.2 words** vs real ACT average of **4.8 words**. Real ACT choices often include:
- Full phrases or clauses
- Multiple word options
- Detailed context

Example:
- ❌ Our choice: "C. changed"
- ✅ Real ACT choice: "C. converted through months of clearing, planning, and planting"

### 4. Passages Too Short
**Status**: ❌ CRITICAL

| Section | Current | Target | Shortfall |
|---------|---------|--------|-----------|
| English | 130-145 words | 300-450 words | **~200 words short** |
| Reading | 468 words avg | 711 words avg | **~250 words short** |

### 5. Math Difficulty Distribution Wrong
**Status**: ❌ CRITICAL

Current distribution:
- Easy: 29% (should be ~13%)
- Medium: 62% (should be ~30%)
- Hard: 9% (should be ~15%)

**Need to reassign ~15 questions to correct distribution**

### 6. Missing 20 English Questions
**Status**: ❌ CRITICAL

Only passages 1-2 and 5 have questions. Passages 3-4 have NO questions assigned.
- Passage 1: ✅ 10 questions
- Passage 2: ✅ 10 questions
- Passage 3: ❌ 0 questions (need 10)
- Passage 4: ❌ 0 questions (need 10)
- Passage 5: ✅ 10 questions

## REAL ACT DATABASE STRUCTURE

The **act_*** tables contain **REAL ACT questions** and should be used as templates:

### Available Real ACT Tables:
- `act_english_questions` - 525 questions
- `act_math_questions` - 420 questions
- `act_reading_questions` - 280 questions
- `act_science_questions` - 280 questions
- `act_reading_passages` - 28 passages
- `act_science_passages` - 43 passages

### Real ACT Question Structure:
English questions use **separate columns** for each choice:
```javascript
{
  question_stem: "Full question text with context...",
  underlined_text: "the specific underlined portion",
  context_before: "text before underline",
  context_after: "text after underline",
  choice_a: "NO CHANGE",
  choice_b: "detailed alternative phrasing with full context",
  choice_c: "another detailed option",
  choice_d: "final detailed option",
  difficulty_level: "easy|medium|hard",
  question_type: "verb-agreement|comma-usage|etc"
}
```

## SOLUTIONS REQUIRED

### Immediate Fixes:

1. **Complete English Section**
   - Generate 10 questions for Passage 3
   - Generate 10 questions for Passage 4
   - Replace placeholder text in questions 21-30
   - Expand all question stems from ~8 words to ~19 words
   - Expand all choices from ~2 words to ~5 words per choice

2. **Expand All Passages**
   - English passages: 130→350 words (add ~200 words each)
   - Reading passages: 468→711 words (add ~250 words each)
   - Maintain ACT writing style and complexity

3. **Lengthen All Questions**
   - Math: 13→33 words (add context, setup, clarification)
   - English: 8→19 words (add detailed prompts)
   - Reading: 15→25 words (add specific references)
   - Science: 12→22 words (add data references)

4. **Fix Math Difficulty Distribution**
   - Move ~7 medium questions to hard
   - Move ~7 medium questions to easy
   - Final target: 6 easy (13%), 13 medium (30%), 7 hard (15%), 19 unlabeled (42%)

5. **Enhance Science Passages**
   - Add more comprehensive data tables
   - Include multiple graphs where appropriate
   - Add experimental setup details
   - Match complexity of real ACT science passages
