## Extraction Strategy

### Phase 1: Create Extraction Scripts âœ…
Following the exact format of Test 6 extraction scripts:
- `EXTRACT-TEST7-ENGLISH-COMPLETE.mjs`
- `EXTRACT-TEST7-MATH-COMPLETE.mjs`
- `EXTRACT-TEST7-READING-COMPLETE.mjs`
- `EXTRACT-TEST7-SCIENCE-COMPLETE.mjs`

### Phase 2: Manual Data Extraction
Each script needs the following data manually extracted from the TXT file:

#### For English:
```javascript
const passage = {
  test_number: 7,
  passage_number: 1,
  title: "Passage Title",
  passage_text: `Complete passage text...`
};

const question = {
  test_number: 7,
  question_number: 1,
  passage_number: 1,
  question_stem: "Full question with <u>underlined</u> portions...",
  underlined_text: "text that was underlined",
  context_before: "text before underline",
  context_after: "text after underline",
  choice_a: "NO CHANGE",
  choice_b: "option B",
  choice_c: "option C",
  choice_d: "option D",
  correct_answer: "A", // from answer key
  question_type: "punctuation|usage|style|organization|revision",
  question_category: "CSE|KLA|POW"
};
```

#### For Math:
```javascript
const question = {
  test_number: 7,
  question_number: 1,
  question_stem: "Full question text...",
  choice_a: "Option A",
  choice_b: "Option B (or F for even questions)",
  choice_c: "Option C (or G)",
  choice_d: "Option D (or H)",
  choice_e: "Option E (or K)",
  correct_answer: "A", // from answer key, normalized to A-E
  question_type: "algebra|geometry|probability|etc",
  question_category: "ALG|GEO"
};
```

#### For Reading:
```javascript
const passage = {
  test_number: 7,
  passage_number: 1,
  title: "Passage Title",
  passage_text: `Complete passage text...`,
  passage_type: "Prose Fiction|Social Science|Humanities|Natural Science"
};

const question = {
  test_number: 7,
  question_number: 1,
  passage_number: 1,
  question_stem: "Full question text...",
  choice_a: "Option A",
  choice_b: "Option B (or F)",
  choice_c: "Option C (or G)",
  choice_d: "Option D (or H)",
  correct_answer: "D", // from answer key
  question_type: "detail|inference|main_idea|etc",
  question_category: "RDG"
};
```

#### For Science:
```javascript
const passage = {
  test_number: 7,
  passage_number: 1,
  title: "Study/Experiment Title",
  passage_text: `Complete passage with tables/figures described...`,
  passage_type: "Data Representation|Research Summaries|Conflicting Viewpoints"
};

const question = {
  test_number: 7,
  question_number: 1,
  passage_number: 1,
  question_stem: "Full question text...",
  choice_a: "Option A",
  choice_b: "Option B (or F)",
  choice_c: "Option C (or G)",
  choice_d: "Option D (or H)",
  correct_answer: "C", // from answer key
  question_type: "data_interpretation|scientific_investigation|etc",
  question_category: "SCI"
};
```

### Phase 3: Execute Extraction Scripts
```bash
# Run each script in sequence
node scripts/extraction/EXTRACT-TEST7-ENGLISH-COMPLETE.mjs
node scripts/extraction/EXTRACT-TEST7-MATH-COMPLETE.mjs
node scripts/extraction/EXTRACT-TEST7-READING-COMPLETE.mjs
node scripts/extraction/EXTRACT-TEST7-SCIENCE-COMPLETE.mjs
```

### Phase 4: Update Lesson Assignment
Modify `INTELLIGENT-LESSON-ASSIGNMENT-ALL-TESTS.mjs`:
```javascript
// Change from:
for (let testNum = 1; testNum <= 6; testNum++)

// To:
for (let testNum = 1; testNum <= 7; testNum++)
```

### Phase 5: Run Lesson Assignment
```bash
node scripts/lessons/INTELLIGENT-LESSON-ASSIGNMENT-ALL-TESTS.mjs
```

### Phase 6: Verify
```bash
# Check database counts
# Should show:
# - 215 new questions (7 * ~30.7 avg)
# - 15 new passages (5 English + 4 Reading + 6-7 Science)
# - All answers match verified answer keys
# - All questions have lesson_id assigned
```
