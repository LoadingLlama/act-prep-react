  title: "Deborah Sampson: A Revolutionary Hero",
  passage_text: `[1]
US history books have traditionally chronicled the actions of male Revolutionary War heroes such as George Washington, Paul Revere, and John Paul Jones. Increasingly, such books include accounts of the many brave women which also contributed‚Äîas spies and soldiers‚Äîto the effort to gain independence from British rule.

[2]
Deborah Sampson of Plympton, Massachusetts, was one of these women. In 1782, despite the fact that women weren't allowed to serve in the military, twenty-one-year-old Sampson joined the colonial army. She disguised herself as a man and enlisted under the name of Robert Shurtliff.

[3]
For fourteen months Sampson served in the army, she acted with exceptional bravery and fortitude. Her commanding officers quickly recognized these traits and sent her on several special missions. On one such mission near West Point, New York, Sampson was part of a scouting party whose assignment to track and capture a British convoy. While pursuing several British soldiers into a swamp, Sampson was shot in the leg. Fearing that her true identity would be discovered, she did not report to the hospital. Instead, Sampson removed the musket ball by herself.

[4]
On another scouting mission, Sampsons' party, was ambushed by British soldiers. To escape the scouts had to wade across a river. A fierce current swept Sampson into deep waters. It was the weight of her heavy backpack and musket, Sampson struggled. For instance, a colonial soldier standing on a sandbar threw her a rope. Summoning her strength, Sampson plucked from the air that which was to save her and made it to shore. [A]

[5]
Sampson survived the winter and spring with her secret undiscovered. [B] In July 1783, however, she was found out. [C] While this meant that she could no longer serve in the army, her exemplary record as a soldier was officially recognized. [D] Later, she was awarded a military pension as a sign of gratitude from the young nation she had helped found.`

  title: "Senator Fong's Plantation and Gardens",
  passage_text: `[1]
With a full career in both politics and business, Hiram Fong never set out to develop one of Oahu's most spectacularly horticulture attractions. [A] Fong, whose political career spanned over thirty years, was one of the first two senators from Hawaii to become a state in 1959 and the first Asian American to serve in the US Senate.

Prior to working in politics, Fong paid his own way through Harvard Law School and, upon graduating, was a part of a law firm. [B] All the while, gardening was his escape.

[2]
Wanting to experiment with growing fruit, he planted bananas, then papaya, lemon, jackfruit, and avocado. [C] By also choosing to plant crops such as bamboo, coconut, betel nut, and turmeric, he broadened the types of plants in his garden. He cultivated slopes covered with ti and pili grasses and forests of trees such as kukui, hala, and koa, vegetation previously an abundance on Oahu.

[3]
After he retired from politics in 1977, Fong continued to oversee his companies, but he focused on gardening, personally importing and planting countless species of plants. Eventually, he divided his land into five gardens, each one named for a US president whom had served while Fong was a senator. The Eisenhower Plateau is dedicated to native Chinese plants, such as the Hong Kong orchid tree and the Java plum. The Johnson Plateau features exotic fruits. Kennedy Valley, with its rain forest canopy, recommends ginger and palms from all over the world. Nixon Valley will abound with flowers‚Äîplumeria, crown flower, and bougainvillea are just a few‚Äîwhile the Ford Plateau highlights hillsides of pili grasses.

[4]
The preserve, bearing his name, is now named Senator Fong's Plantation and Gardens, complete with a visitors' center and guided tours. [D] Until his death in 2004 at ninety-seven, Fong spent every weekend tending to his flowers and trees and a moment to mingle with visitors. He credited gardening for his long, healthy life.`
