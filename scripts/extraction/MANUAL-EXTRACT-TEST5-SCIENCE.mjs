    title: "Moving Rocks in the Playa",
    passage_text: `In a particular playa (relatively flat, dry desert basin) evidence shows that some large rocks have moved along the surface, leaving shallow trails in the clay sediment, some up to several hundred meters long. Three scientists provided explanations for how these rocks moved.

Scientist 1:
In the spring, snowmelt from surrounding mountains runs downhill and collects in the playa. At night, cold temperatures cause this water to freeze around the rocks. When temperatures rise again, the ice begins to melt, leaving a layer of mud on the surface and ice "rafts" around the rocks. The buoyancy of the ice rafts floats the rocks on top of the mud such that even light winds can then push the rocks along the surface. Evidence of this lifting is seen in that the trails left by rocks are both shallow and only about 2/3 as wide as the rocks themselves. Due to the combination of ice, mud, and light winds, the rocks are able to move several hundred meters in a few days.

Scientist 2:
Snowmelt from surrounding mountains does collect in the playa during the spring. However, the temperature in the playa does not get cold enough for ice to form. When the playa's surface gets wet, the top layer of clay transforms into a slick, muddy film. In addition, dormant algae present in the dry clay begin to grow rapidly when the clay becomes wet. The presence of mud and algae reduces friction between the rocks and the clay. Even so, relatively strong winds are required to push the rocks along the wet surface, forming trails. Due to the combination of mud, algae, and strong winds, the rocks are able to move several hundred meters in a few hours.

Scientist 3:
Water does collect in the playa, producing mud and ice. However, neither mud nor ice is responsible for the rocks' movements. The playa is located along a fault line between tectonic plates. Minor vertical shifts in the plates cause the rocks to move downhill, leaving trails. Due to the combination of tectonic plate movement and strong winds, the rocks are able to move only a few meters over several years.`,

    title: "CO2 Gas Production from Diet Cola",
    passage_text: `When certain substances are added to diet cola, CO2 gas is produced, generating a foam. Two experiments were done to study this process.

In each trial, an apparatus like that shown in Figure 1 was used as follows: A jar was nearly filled with H2O and fitted with a 2-holed lid. One end of a tube (Tube B) was inserted through one of the holes and submerged. The other end of Tube B was placed in an empty graduated cylinder. Another tube (Tube A) was inserted through the other hole in the lid. A certain solid substance was inserted into the other end of Tube A, and the substance was secured by a clamp. Tube A was then attached to a freshly opened bottle containing 355 mL of diet cola. The clamp was removed, releasing the substance into the diet cola. The foam that was produced traveled into the jar, and liquid was transferred into the cylinder. The mass of CO2 produced was calculated based on the volume of liquid that was measured in the cylinder after foaming had ceased.

Experiment 1:
In each of Trials 1-4, a different 1 of 4 substances of equal mass—a piece of chalk, a sugar cube, a fruit-flavored piece of candy, or a mint-flavored piece of candy—was added to a bottle of diet cola at 3°C.

Table 1 shows volume of liquid in cylinder (mL) and mass of CO2 produced (g) for each trial:
Trial 1 (chalk): 699 mL, 1.36 g
Trial 2 (sugar cube): 570 mL, 1.11 g
Trial 3 (fruit candy): 525 mL, 1.02 g
Trial 4 (mint candy): 631 mL, 1.23 g

Experiment 2:
In each of Trials 5-8, Trial 4 from Experiment 1 was repeated, except that the temperature of the diet cola was different in each trial.

Table 2 shows temperature (°C), volume of liquid in cylinder (mL), and mass of CO2 produced (g):
Trial 5: 10°C, 598 mL, 1.13 g
Trial 6: 25°C, 539 mL, 0.969 g
Trial 7: 45°C, 501 mL, 0.844 g
Trial 8: 60°C, 476 mL, 0.766 g`,

    title: "Effects of pH and Nickel on Plant Growth",
    passage_text: `Scientists studied the effects of pH and of nickel concentration on plant growth and on the uptake of iron and zinc by plants. Recently germinated seedlings of Species M and Species U were fed 1 of 12 nutrient solutions (Solutions 1-12) for 8 days and then were harvested. Solutions 1-12 differed only in pH and/or nickel concentration.

Table 1 shows, for each species, the average dry mass of the plants that were fed each nutrient solution.

Solutions and average dry mass (g) for Species M and Species U:
Solution 1: pH 7, 0 μM nickel - M: 33.9 g, U: 10.7 g
Solution 2: pH 7, 5 μM nickel - M: 28.8 g, U: 10.7 g
Solution 3: pH 7, 10 μM nickel - M: 23.8 g, U: 9.6 g
Solution 4: pH 7, 15 μM nickel - M: 18.7 g, U: 8.5 g
Solution 5: pH 6, 0 μM nickel - M: 33.9 g, U: 9.2 g
Solution 6: pH 6, 5 μM nickel - M: 28.8 g, U: 9.2 g
Solution 7: pH 6, 10 μM nickel - M: 23.8 g, U: 8.1 g
Solution 8: pH 6, 15 μM nickel - M: 18.7 g, U: 7.0 g
Solution 9: pH 5, 0 μM nickel - M: 27.8 g, U: 7.7 g
Solution 10: pH 5, 5 μM nickel - M: 22.7 g, U: 7.7 g
Solution 11: pH 5, 10 μM nickel - M: 17.6 g, U: 6.6 g
Solution 12: pH 5, 15 μM nickel - M: 12.4 g, U: 5.4 g

Figure 1 shows, for each species, the average iron content and the average zinc content of the plants that were fed Solutions 1-4.

For Solutions 1-4 (0, 5, 10, 15 μM nickel):
Species M iron content (μg/g): ~400, ~300, ~200, ~100
Species M zinc content (μg/g): ~100, ~150, ~200, ~400
Species U iron content (μg/g): ~400, ~400, ~400, ~400

    title: "Ammonia Production",
    passage_text: `Ammonia (NH3) can be produced according to the chemical equation:
N2 + 3H2 ⇌ 2NH3

The equilibrium arrow (⇌) indicates that this reaction proceeds in both directions until it is at equilibrium, so that both the forward reaction (production of NH3) and the backward reaction (production of N2 and H2) occur at the same rate. Equilibrium can be shifted forward or backward by changing the temperature, pressure, or concentration of reactants or products.

Two experiments were done using an apparatus with a reactor and condenser. In each trial, Steps 1-4 occurred:
1. A fresh catalyst (Catalyst W, X, Y, or Z), 160 kg of H2, and 745 kg of N2 were placed in the reactor.
2. The H2 and N2 reacted at a constant temperature and a constant pressure until equilibrium was established.
3. A mixture of NH3 and any unreacted H2 and N2 flowed through Pipe A to a -50°C condenser at 1 atmosphere (atm) of pressure.
4. NH3 condensed and exited the apparatus. Any unreacted H2 and N2 flowed into Pipe B, returning to the reactor.

Steps 2-4 reoccurred in cycles until no more H2 and N2 returned from the condenser.

Experiment 1:
A set of 9 trials was conducted with each of the 4 catalysts. For each set, the pressure was 150 atm; within each set, the temperature was different for each trial. Figure 1 shows, for each trial, the number of cycles of Steps 2-4.

At 300°C, 350°C, 400°C, 450°C, 500°C respectively:
Catalyst W: ~5, ~10, ~20, ~35, ~48 cycles
Catalyst X: ~5, ~8, ~15, ~25, ~37 cycles
Catalyst Y: ~7, ~12, ~22, ~32, ~42 cycles
Catalyst Z: ~5, ~10, ~18, ~30, ~45 cycles

Experiment 2:
Four sets of 9 trials each were conducted with Catalyst Z. For each set, the temperature was different; within each set, the pressure was different for each trial. Figure 2 shows, for each trial, the amount of NH3 produced in the first cycle of Steps 2-4.

At 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 atm respectively:
300°C: ~150, ~250, ~350, ~450, ~550 kg
350°C: ~200, ~300, ~400, ~500, ~600 kg
400°C: ~250, ~350, ~450, ~500, ~550 kg
450°C: ~300, ~375, ~425, ~450, ~500 kg`,

    title: "Sound Wave Attenuation",
    passage_text: `As a sound wave travels through a medium, the wave becomes attenuated (loses energy). The attenuation coefficient, α, is the rate at which the wave's intensity level (a measure of sound volume) decreases with distance as a result of this energy loss; the greater the value of α, the greater the decrease in intensity level with distance.

Figure 1 shows, for waves of 3 different frequencies (in hertz, Hz), how α (in decibels per kilometer, dB/km) varies with temperature in air at 10% relative humidity.

At temperatures from -20°C to 100°C:
200 Hz wave: α ranges from ~1 to ~3 dB/km, with peak around 35°C
500 Hz wave: α ranges from ~3 to ~9.5 dB/km, with peak around 10°C
1,000 Hz wave: α ranges from ~6 to ~21 dB/km, with peak around 10°C

Figure 2 shows, for waves of 3 different frequencies, how α varies with relative humidity in air at 20°C.

At relative humidity from 10% to 90%:
200 Hz wave: α decreases from ~2.5 to ~0.5 dB/km
500 Hz wave: α peaks at ~12 dB/km around 15% humidity, then decreases
1,000 Hz wave: α peaks at ~18 dB/km around 15% humidity, then decreases to ~7 dB/km`,

    title: "Effects of Sweeteners on Rats",
    passage_text: `Three studies compared the effects of 5 sweeteners (Sweeteners Q-U) on food consumption by rats and on the concentrations of leptin and ghrelin (hormones that regulate appetite) in the blood of rats. Sweeteners Q-U differ only in the percent by mass of fructose and of glucose.

Table 1 shows percent by mass:
Sweetener Q: 0% fructose, 100% glucose
Sweetener R: 42% fructose, 58% glucose
Sweetener S: 50% fructose, 50% glucose
Sweetener T: 55% fructose, 45% glucose
Sweetener U: 100% fructose, 0% glucose

Study 1:
Each of 5 groups (Groups 1-5) of rats was assigned a solution having a 100 g/L concentration of 1 of the 5 sweeteners. Each rat was placed in a separate cage and provided unlimited access to the assigned sweetener solution and to solid food for 56 days.

Table 2 shows amount consumed per rat per day:
Group 1 (Q): 73 mL solution, 9 g solid food
Group 2 (R): 55 mL solution, 14 g solid food
Group 3 (S): 52 mL solution, 16 g solid food
Group 4 (T): 48 mL solution, 18 g solid food
Group 5 (U): 29 mL solution, 23 g solid food

On Day 56, blood was collected from each rat for analysis in Studies 2 and 3.

Study 2:
A 1 mL blood sample from each rat was placed in a separate test tube containing 0.2 mL of Indicator N (which reacts with leptin to form a blue dye). The concentration of blue dye in each tube was directly proportional to the leptin concentration in the blood sample.

Table 3 shows leptin concentration per sample (pM):
Group 1 (Q): 804 pM
Group 2 (R): 622 pM
Group 3 (S): 553 pM
Group 4 (T): 475 pM
Group 5 (U): 251 pM

Study 3:
Study 2 was repeated, except that Indicator P (which reacts with ghrelin to form a yellow dye) was used instead of Indicator N. The concentration of yellow dye in each tube was directly proportional to the ghrelin concentration in the blood sample.

Table 4 shows ghrelin concentration per sample (pM):
Group 1 (Q): 852 pM
Group 2 (R): 1,125 pM
Group 3 (S): 1,279 pM
Group 4 (T): 1,450 pM
Group 5 (U): 1,758 pM`,
