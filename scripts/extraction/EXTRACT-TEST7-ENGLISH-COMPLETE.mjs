  title: "King Tut's Space Bug",
  passage_text: `Among the treasures found in Pharaoh Tutankhamen's tomb, in the 1920s one diminutive ornament poses a mystery that spans the ages. The "pectoral," a kind of jewelry worn on one's chest depicts Egyptian symbols with gold and gems. Most strikingly, at the piece's center is a beetle carved from an ethereal yellow-green material.

[1] Originally, archaeologists identified the beetle as chalcedony, a quartz gemstone. [2] In 1996, likewise, mineralogist Vincenzo de Michele noticed the beetle at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and suspected it wasn't chalcedony. [3] After studying the beetle, he determined it to be 28.5-million-year-old glass. [4] De Michele then traced the glass to the Great Sand Sea of western Egypt, where pieces of it lay strewn across 6,500 square kilometers. [5] Glass is made by heating substances, such as, sand. [6] Though lava and lightning strikes can create glass the desert glass's traces of the elements iridium and osmium pointed to an unearthly culprit: a meteoroid. [7] It's true that the tremendous heat and pressure around the globe of meteorite impacts in many places have created glass. [8] But meteorites leave craters, and their was no crater that could account for the desert glass.

In recent years, scientists John Wasson and Mark Boslough have put their research-whiz brains to work on a new explanation for the desert glass. Intrigued by the 1994 collision of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter and a 1908 meteoroid airburst over a remote region of Russia that flattened 80 million trees but left no crater, they ran sophisticated computer simulations. Their conclusion: a meteoroid burned up in the atmosphere, but its fireball reached Earth and scorched an expanse of sandstone to temperatures above 1,800¬∞C.

Imagination can take the story through there. Some three thousand years ago, an artisan admired a piece of desert glass; so gorgeous that, with a little carving, it would befit a great pharaoh.`

  title: "Not All It's Krakened Up to Be",
  passage_text: `On a peaceful June night in my hometown of Muscatine, Iowa, I pulled into a parking spot near the Mississippi River, eager to see my friends. Then I saw it. Protruding from the windows of the old brick building in front of me were four enormous, bright-pink tentacles (they must have been twenty-five feet long!) that waved in the slight breeze. I didn't wait around to get a full view of the creature. Instead, I put the car in reverse, driving home, figured my friends could have dinner without me.

While I was somewhat familiar with the Norse legend of the squid-like kraken, a mythological sea creature that resembled an oversize squid. Supposedly, the kraken could wrap an entire ship in its tentacled embrace eventually swallowing the ship whole‚Äîsailors and all. But the kraken of Norse legend certainly never frequented the homes or places of business. And who had ever heard of a neon-pink sea monster?

A month after my ordeal, my friend Rhonda called me and asked if I was feeling okay. I was just starting to relax and enjoy our nighttime stroll when we turned onto Mulberry Avenue. I must have made a noise‚Äîa yelp, or perhaps a blood-curdling scream because Rhonda looked over at me with eyebrows raised. I pointed vaguely, expecting her to share in my horror.

This time, the tentacles unfolded from the windows of a large yellow house. I covered my eyes, and Rhonda said, "Louise. It's just an art installation." I peered through my fingers as she told me that Andrew Anderson, a local artist, had created the pink kraken. I had to admit that the kraken looked kind of friendly up close.

The undersides of the soft, air-filled tentacles, were white-and-pink plaid. I could hear the unceasing buzz of the air blowers that, according to Rhonda, were responsible for making the inflatable sculpture seem alive. As we walked away, I felt a little silly. I made Rhonda promise not to tell our friends. And then I snuck one last peek at my summertime stalker and smiled.`

  title: "Programmed for Success",
  passage_text: `Today's palm-sized computers descended from the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC), the world's first successful electronic computer. It was a massive machine that took up 1,800 square feet of floor space and weighed 30 tons.

ENIAC was designed during World War II with the intention of helping the US military calculate precise trajectory tables that would of allowed artillery to be adjusted quickly.

A group of men designed and built ENIAC, a group of six women mathematicians, lead by Jean Jennings Bartik, programmed it. Bartik and her team figured out how to set ENIAC's 3,000 switches and hundreds of connection cables so that it could run each calculation correctly. Programming ENIAC required enormous patience. To change a program, the women had to rewire the machine manually by manipulating punch cards and switches in a series of wiring boards. It could take as long as two days to make even a small change.

Once Bartik's team finished a program, though, a complex calculation such that it would have taken a human several days to complete could be done by ENIAC in a fraction of a second. Therefore, the machine could instantly determine the cube root of 2,589 to the 16th power. In one second, ENIAC could discharge 5,000 additions, 357 multiplications, or 38 divisions.

Such computational capacity was used not only by the military but also in many scientific fields, including weather prediction, atomic energy research, and wind-tunnel design.

[1] But all the media attention went to the machine itself and the men who designed it. [2] The introduction of ENIAC to the world in 1946 was headline news. [3] The women programmers were largely forgotten until the late 1980s, when Harvard student, Kathryn Kleiman, came across the women's names' in a computer-history book. [4] Kleiman filmed twenty hours of interviews with Bartik included with other surviving programmers. [5] This material finally brought attention to the ENIAC women, they were the twentieth century's first computer programmers.`

  title: "Painting Outside the Lines",
  passage_text: `[1]
Today, Yankton Sioux modernist painter, Oscar Howe, is recognized as one of the most influential American Indian artists of the twentieth century. Howe received many prizes and accolades during his career. But a pivotal moment in 1958 led to his emergence as a key position responsible for broadening the boundaries of American Indian art.

[2]
In 1958, Howe submitted a painting, Umine Wacipe: War and Peace Dance, to the Philbrook Art Center for consideration in the museum's annual competition showcasing art by American Indians. Representative of Howe's style at the time, the painting featured sharp, angular shapes in rich pink, blue, and purple hues that geometrically depicted five dancers. [A] The jurors for the competition rejected Howe's submission, claiming it was "a fine painting ... but not Indian." The then widely held jurors shared the position that American Indian art should be based on the conventions of the Studio style. Works in this style depict traditional ceremonies, dance, and mythology and feature strong outlines and flat fields of color. [B] Howe's deviation from the style, in particular his use of certain techniques, was perceived to be the result of European influences, which the jurors considered incompatible with authentic American Indian art.

[3]
Howe displayed his work in more than sixty solo art shows. In an open letter, Howe argued that adhering and sticking to notions of tradition would suffocate innovation in American Indian art. Furthermore, he argued, his work did employ American Indian art conventions. The angular shapes in his painting, Howe noted, is actually derivative of the Dakota notion of tohokmu, the spider web.

[4]
The Philbrook's jurors conceded; they expanded the scope of the competition to internalize experimental art. [C] Although questions related to art and identity are still on people's minds, Howe's efforts continue to inspire confidence in many artists who might otherwise feel confined by tradition. [D]`

  title: "In Tune",
  passage_text: `Every April, North Carolina's Louisburg College, normally only humming with students, welcomes a whistling crew for the weeklong International Whistlers Convention. A competition spawned from a folk festival, the IWC has existed for over forty years, attracting whistlers from across the globe.

[1] Since most whistlers aren't professional (though a few do make a living from whistling tours and commercial spots). [2] Technique, which includes tone and pitch, represent only fifty percent of their scoring criteria. [3] Still, qualifying for the IWC requires rigorous training. [4] Judges look for far more than a performer's ability to carry a tune. [5] Presentation and performance make up the rest, requiring judges to scrutinize participants' facial expressions, how participants present themselves overall onstage, and use of lips.

Participants can compete in both classical and popular musical categories. They might, nevertheless, whistle an entire movement from Beethoven's Fifth Symphony or a more modern selection from pop artist Beyonc√©. Many returning participants ambitiously aim on top of their previous performances with even more complex pieces.

Competitors, however, are far from cutthroat. The global whistling community is a tight-knit family, and Louisburg its home. A 2012 documentary about the IWC captures these sentiments. Filmmaker, Ien Chi, a first-time whistling competitor himself, tells the story of a niche group of individuals from Japan, Korea, France, Israel, and elsewhere, whose mutual passion for whistling eclipses language barriers.

One US participant shared with Chi that he had waited thirty-four years to attend the world's premier whistling competition, and meet fellow whistlers. Others, acknowledging the outside perception of whistling as simply a quirky hobby, described their craft as an art form that fosters joy. Chi concludes that the IWC attracts people who are not just vying for medals; the convention also allows participants to communally celebrate this art form, year after year.`
