    title: "Mothers and Memory",
    content: `Passage A by Susan Power

My mother tells me stories every day: while she cleans, while she cooks, on our way to the library, standing in the checkout line at the supermarket. I like to share her stories with other people and chatter away when I am able to command adult attention.

"She left the reservation when she was sixteen years old," I tell my audience. Sixteen sounds very old to me, but I always state the number because it seems integral to my recitation. "She had never been on a train before or used a telephone. She left Standing Rock to take a job in Chicago so she could help out the family during the War. She was so petrified of the new surroundings, she stayed in her seat all the way from McLaughlin, South Dakota, to Chicago, Illinois, and didn't move once." I usually laugh after saying this because I cannot imagine my mother being afraid of anything. She is so tall, a true Dakota woman; she rises against the sun like a skyscraper, and when I draw her picture in my notebook, she takes up the entire page. She talks politics and attends sit-ins and says what's on her mind. I am her small shadow and witness. I am the timid daughter who can rage only on paper.

We don't have much money, but Mom takes me from one end of the city to the other, on foot, on buses. I will grow up believing that Chicago belongs to me, because it was given to me by my mother.

Some days we haunt the Art Institute, and my mother pauses before a Picasso. "He did this during his blue period," she tells me. I squint at the blue man holding a blue guitar. "Was he very sad?" I ask.

"Yes, I think he was." My mother takes my hand and looks away from the painting. I can see a story developing behind her eyes, and I tug on her arm to release the words. She will tell me why Picasso was blue, what his thoughts were as he painted this canvas. She relates anecdotes I will never find in books, never see footnoted in a biography of the master artist. I don't even bother to check these references, because I like my mother's version best.

Passage B by Leslie Chang

Water belongs to everyone and to no one. For this reason, I have always had a particular affinity for it, which may strike some as mysterious. Westerners ask me where my parents were born, as though the answer will enable them to glean some knowledge. The answer is Beijing and Luoyang. The truth is that this response signifies nothing. The meaningful question would be to ask where my ancestors lived. The answer to that is inland. My father's people came from Wuhan, birthplace of the Chinese republic and the capital of Hubei, that sweltering province sandwiched between Sichuan and Anhui. My mother's father was from Inner Mongolia, land of desert and grassy plains.

Yet water calls to me. I remain convinced that I would find peace if I could only have a house by the ocean. I insisted on being married near the sea. This bond, I know, comes from my mother. She longs for a view more than anything else. Once, staying at a hotel in San Francisco, she insisted on seeing three different rooms before she found one with which she was satisfied. It was on a floor so high it made me dizzy, with a corner window overlooking the bay. Even so, my mother spent most of her time on the bridge linking the elevator bank to our wing. The bridge consisted almost entirely of windows. It offered a view in either direction that was brilliant and blinding. If there had been a chair, she could have sat forever, letting the gold sun and blue sea overwhelm her through the glass.

My mother may have descended from inland people, but they were also nomads. Her father rode his horse practically the length of China, from Inner Mongolia to Guangzhou, a distance of some twelve hundred miles. My mother could only become a nomad herself—forever moving, yet always retaining some essential part of her being, all the places she has been. In this, she is like water, not dead water but fearlessly changing and going, recognizable and intact in spite of its shimmering. When she gazes out on its expanse, she sees her own reflection. When I gaze, I see her, my mother, always pulling away, returning and pulling away again. I drink from her, and she slips between my fingertips. She has borne me all this way. I cannot decide whether I want her to stay or go. When she is here, I wish she would leave. When she is gone, I wish she would return. She pulls away again, a force as elemental as the ebbing tide. I remain a child on the shore, eagerly collecting the sea glass and driftwood.`

    title: "The Natural Ice Industry",
    content: `When the first comprehensive report on the ice industry of the United States was commissioned in 1879 as part of a national census, it was estimated that about eight million tons were harvested annually, though the business was so extensive and production so poorly documented that this was, at best, a well-informed guess. The figures were put together by one Henry Hall, who signed himself "special agent" and gave an account of the great growth of the industry in the preceding ten years. Of the eight million tons of ice harvested, about five million reached the consumer—the rest melted during shipment and storage. By far the biggest market was in New York, and none of its ice was manufactured artificially: it was all cut in winter and stored in hundreds of timber warehouses that lined the lakes and rivers and had a capacity of up to fifty thousand tons each.

Between New York and Albany, 150 miles up the Hudson River, there were 135 icehouses, but even this was not enough to supply the metropolis, which relied heavily on imports. In fact, in the year of the great ice census, New York and Philadelphia suffered one of their recurrent ice "famines," when unseasonably warm weather destroyed the harvest on the Hudson and local lakes, and the price of ice rose from $4 to $5 a ton. That year the ice was fifteen to twenty inches thick in Maine, a top-quality crop, and it could be shipped down to New York at an estimated cost of $1.50 a ton. This produced a frenzy of harvesting on the Kennebec, Penobscot, and Sheepscot Rivers, and two thousand cargoes of ice packed in hay and sawdust were shipped south to New York, Philadelphia, and other more southern cities, where they were sold for a total of around $1.5 million.

Though the demand for ice rose annually, the New York suppliers did not explore the use of artificial refrigeration. Instead, they began to buy up sections of the Kennebec River shoreline and to erect great wooden warehouses there, transforming the landscape of the river for many miles. It was the same farther inland, where ice companies bought up shoreline along the lakes and put up storehouses to supply the meat industry of Chicago and the brewers of Milwaukee, as well as millions of domestic consumers.

The first real crisis in the natural-ice trade was caused not by competition from artificial manufacture, but by pollution. As the cities grew, they encroached on the rivers and lakes from which the ice was cut, and soon there were health scares. This produced a search for cleaner supplies farther away from towns, and stimulated the search for a means of manufacturing ice with pure water. The realization that the bacteria that cause diseases such as typhoid were not killed off in frozen water added to the urgency of finding safer forms of refrigeration.

The natural-ice trade began to decline from the early decades of the twentieth century, though in more remote areas of North America where electric power was not available but lake ice was abundant in winter, it survived as late as the 1950s. As ice harvesting died out, the evidence of its former vast scale rapidly disappeared. There was no alternative use for the great icehouses, many of which simply burned down, often set alight by a spark from a steam train—they were surprisingly flammable, as most were made of wood and kept as dry as possible to better preserve the blocks of ice they housed. But the majority were demolished or simply rotted away.

Over a wide area of the northern states, young diving enthusiasts with no knowledge of the former ice trade still emerge from lakes and rivers clutching an impressive variety of odd implements—plows and chisels and scrapers that fell through the ice during the harvesting. One or two museums keep small displays of these tools, and collectors have preserved manufacturers' catalogs that proudly present their versions of the ice plow, the ice saw, the grapple, the jack grapple, the breaking-off bar, the caulk bar, the packing chisel, the house bar, the fork bar, the float hook, the line marker, and many other specialist implements the use of which has long been forgotten.

The inner-city icehouses have also gone, and the ice wagon and the iceman are rapidly fading memories. All that is left in America of this once-great industry is the water itself, which provided a continuously renewable supply of ice each winter. There are few memorials on the banks of the rivers and lakes that once produced such a vital crop.`

    title: "The Art of Film Dubbing",
    content: `Filmmakers have debated the respective merits of subtitles and dubbing since the earliest sound films. In "The Impossible Life of Clark Costa," published in 1940 in the film journal Cinema, director Michelangelo Antonioni wrote that Romolo Costa, the person who dubbed all of actor Clark Gable's performances, was a "hybrid individual born out of a chemical combination." This "half Clark, half Costa" was unbearable to Antonioni, who considered dubbing to be a mere "acoustic surrogate" of acting. To him, dubbing compromised the intention of the director, leading to an artificial product that lacked artistic unity.

Director Pier Paolo Pasolini, who called both dubbing and subtitles "evils," said that, between the two, dubbing was the less harmful, since it allowed you to see the picture in full. Director Jean Renoir called dubbing a "monstrosity, a challenge to human and divine laws."

Director Federico Fellini didn't agree with any of them. Dubbing was an extension of his shoots, a technique he would use to retouch and rewrite. He mercilessly dubbed over his actors, changing dialogue in postproduction, sometimes having worked without a script. (He reportedly instructed his actors to count aloud in front of the camera so that he could insert new dialogue afterward.) Renato Cortesi, a veteran Fellini dubber, told me that, during the filming of Amarcord (1973), he witnessed Fellini ask an old Neapolitan lady to tell him a sad story. Over footage of this woman recounting a tragic tale about her grandson, Fellini added a new sound track about war and hunger recorded by an actor from Emilia-Romagna, combining the vivid expressiveness of the South with his favorite northern accent.

If you visit a dubbing studio, the over-the-top zest of the actors is evident in everything from their melodramatic speech to their movements; standing in front of the microphone, they coil and twitch. I asked Cortesi whether this was a consequence of having to focus one's lifelong talent into the few centimeters between mouth and microphone, a kind of bodily rebellion to the condition of being heard but not seen, and he laughed. "Of course it isn't easy to spend a life in the darkness, but this is hardly the reason why they twitch and turn! Dubbers are used to reciting while trying to re-create the bodily sensations of what they see on the screen before them. If there is running in the film, they will run on their feet. The moving," he explained, "is the result of re-creating large movements in small spaces."

There are still few options for those seeking to watch subtitled, original-language films at a movie house in Italy. The Metropolitan cinema on Via del Corso closed recently after a long battle involving intellectuals, show-business people, and American tourists in Rome, to be replaced with a clothing store. Italians remain hooked on dubbing—perhaps because of simple affection. Familiar voices yield emotional attachment.

Francesco Vairano, a dubber and dubbing director known for adapting foreign films considered to be "undubbable," such as the French box office hit Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis ("Welcome to the Sticks," 2008), which relies on linguistic misunderstandings for much of its comedy, explained that actors become just as attached to their parts as audiences do. Vairano has been one of the few directors to break the habit of matching the same Italian dubber to a foreign actor for all his films, preferring instead to select the dubber according to the requirements of the role, and, he admits, he was hated by all the prima donna dubbers for this. "If you take that actor away from them," he told me, "they will insult you."

In 2007, I met dubber Luca Ward, who provided the voice of the narrator for a romantic comedy I co-wrote, Scusa ma Ti Chiamo Amore ("Sorry but I Love You"). What I didn't then know was that everyone Ward met wanted him to recite actor Samuel L. Jackson's Ezekiel 25:17 passage from the film Pulp Fiction, and that I should consider it an honor that he would offer a performance to a stranger. When he finally did recite the monologue, it was astonishing, every dramatic pause carefully timed and every word perfectly enunciated. I understood that, if anybody took Samuel L. Jackson away from Ward, it would have meant taking away a part of his soul; he was, as Antonioni would say, half Ward, half Jackson. Leaving the day's recording session, Ward told me he was off to have dinner with actress Meg Ryan, before raising an eyebrow and clarifying, "With Meg Ryan's dubber... I am having dinner with Meg Ryan's voice."`

    title: "Ocean Acidification",
    content: `Ocean acidification, often called "the other CO₂ problem," occurs when carbon dioxide from the atmosphere dissolves in seawater, forming carbonic acid. As atmospheric CO₂ levels have increased due to human activities since the Industrial Revolution, the ocean has absorbed about 30% of this excess carbon dioxide. While this absorption has helped slow the rate of climate change by reducing the amount of CO₂ in the atmosphere, it has come at a cost to marine ecosystems.

When CO₂ dissolves in seawater, it forms carbonic acid, which releases hydrogen ions and lowers the pH of the water. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the ocean's pH has dropped by approximately 0.1 units, from 8.2 to 8.1. While this may seem like a small change, the pH scale is logarithmic, meaning that this represents a 26% increase in acidity. Scientists predict that if current trends continue, ocean pH could drop by another 0.3-0.4 units by the end of this century.

The effects of ocean acidification are already being observed in marine ecosystems around the world. Many marine organisms, including corals, mollusks, and some plankton species, rely on calcium carbonate to build their shells and skeletons. As ocean pH decreases, it becomes more difficult for these organisms to extract the carbonate ions they need from seawater. This process, called calcification, becomes increasingly energy-intensive as acidity increases, forcing organisms to divert energy from other vital functions such as growth, reproduction, and immune response.

Coral reefs are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification. These diverse ecosystems support approximately 25% of all marine species despite covering less than 1% of the ocean floor. As acidification progresses, corals struggle to maintain their calcium carbonate skeletons, and existing structures may even begin to dissolve. This weakens the reef structure and reduces its ability to provide habitat for the countless species that depend on coral reefs for shelter and food.

The impacts extend beyond individual organisms to entire food webs. Many species at the base of marine food chains, such as pteropods (tiny swimming snails), are showing signs of shell dissolution in increasingly acidic waters. These organisms serve as food for fish, seabirds, and marine mammals, so their decline could have cascading effects throughout ocean ecosystems.

Researchers are working to understand how different species might adapt to changing ocean chemistry. Some organisms may develop greater tolerance to acidic conditions through natural selection, while others may be forced to migrate to areas with more favorable water chemistry. However, the rapid pace of change may outstrip the ability of many species to adapt, particularly those with slow reproduction rates or limited mobility.

Addressing ocean acidification requires reducing global CO₂ emissions, as the ocean will continue to absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide as long as concentrations remain elevated. In the meantime, scientists and conservationists are exploring strategies to help marine ecosystems cope with changing conditions, including establishing marine protected areas in regions that may be more resilient to acidification and reducing other stressors such as pollution and overfishing that could compound the effects of changing ocean chemistry.`
