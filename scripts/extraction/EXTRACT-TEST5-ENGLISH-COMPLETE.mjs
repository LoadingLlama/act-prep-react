const PASSAGE_1_TEXT = `Bar Codes: A Linear History

[1]
In 1948, graduate students, Norman Woodland and Bernard Silver, took on a problem that had troubled retailers for years: how to keep track of store inventories. Inspired by the dots and dashes of Morse code, however, Woodland and Silver created a system of lines that could encode data. Called a symbology, the pattern created by the spacing and widths of the lines encodes information by representing different characters.

[2]
The first bar code was composed of four white lines set at specific distances from each other on a black background. The first line was always present. Depending on the presence or absence of the remaining three lines, up to seven different arrangements were susceptible and, therefore, seven different encodings. Today, twenty-nine white lines making more than half a billion encodings possible.

[3]
To create a bar code scanner, Woodland and Silver adapted technology from an optical movie sound system. Their prototype scanner used a 500-watt bulb, a photomultiplier tube (a device that detects light), and an oscilloscope (a device that translates electronic signals into readable information). Although successful, the concoction was both large and costly. For example, progress stalled until the 1970s, when laser technology (both more compact and less expensive) became available.

[4]
In today's scanners, a laser sends light back and forth across a bar code. While the black lines absorb the light, the white lines reflect it back at a fixed mirror inside the scanner. In this way, the scanner reads the symbology and decodes the information.

[5]
Today, being that there are one- and two-dimensional bar codes using numeric and alphanumeric symbologies. Bar codes are used not only for a pack of gum or an airline ticket, but also for research. In one study, for instance, tiny bar codes were placed on bees tracking their activities. Shaping the way we gather, track, and share information, we have almost certainly exceeded even Woodland and Silver's expectations.`;

// PASSAGE 2: Glowing on an Adventure (Questions 16-30)
// ============================================================================

const PASSAGE_2_TEXT = `Glowing on an Adventure

As I pulled my camera out of my backpack, I felt a tap on my arm.

"No photographs," whispered the woman next to me, pointing up to the cave ceiling. "The flash will make them stop glowing," she said, whispering.

She was referring to the thousands of glowworms that clung to the limestone ceiling and, with their radiant bodies, flooded the cave in aquamarine light. While I was traveling on canoe on a group tour through the renowned Glowworm Grotto of New Zealand's Waitomo Caves. Were it not for the twinkling light of these Arachnocampa luminosa, a species unique to New Zealand and abundant in these caves, this meandering subterranean passageway would feel as though it were downright ensconced in shadows.

I sheepishly tucked the camera away and focused again on the glowworms. Collectively, they resembled the cosmos, a sea of stars in a clear night sky. Beautiful‚Äîyet what made them glow?

"Bioluminescence," the woman said, peculiarly sensing my curiosity. A badge was pinned to her shirt indicated she was a biochemist, here, I guessed, to research the organism.

She explained that to attract prey, glowworms (not really worms at all, but the larval stage of a fungus gnat) emit light through their translucent skin; via a cellular chemical reaction. The cells produce luciferin, a chemical pigment that reacts with oxygen to produce light that shines through the organism's tail-end intestine. From its mouth, she showed me, all glowworms dangle shimmering silken threads glossed in beads of mucus. Cave-dwelling insects are trapped in these threads, then reeled in like fish on a line, and finally lured by the light.

The light responds to environmental factors. The sound of splashing water, however, might signal that prey is nearby, causing them to brighten.

Our trip neared its end. I spotted a dragonfly in the cave. I knew its fate, it would be ensnared, just as I had been by the brilliance of these luminescent creatures.`;

// PASSAGE 3: A Rose by the Name Antique (Questions 31-45)
// ============================================================================

const PASSAGE_3_TEXT = `A Rose by the Name Antique

With shears in hand, I clip a thin branch from the rosebush in my backyard garden. I place this one to head to the greenhouse. There, I will deposit these clippings in rich soil; roots will take hold, buds will sprout, and a new plant will find a home in my garden.

My roses are not your average hybrid-tea roses (those long-stemmed, special occasion roses with well-formed buds). Mine are antique roses, old, or heirloom varieties, that have existed in gardens worldwide for centuries.

Each of my antique roses has a story. The 'Autumn Damask' rose, for example, is thought to have been brought to Europe from the Middle East by returning crusaders. Legend has it that this rose was even used in ancient Rome to make perfume. Today, it still fills my garden with its rich fragrance.

Another favorite is the 'Old Blush' rose, which was one of the first roses introduced to Europe from China in the late 1700s. This rose blooms repeatedly throughout the growing season, a trait that made it invaluable to rose breeders who wanted to create roses that bloomed more than once per year.

What draws me to antique roses is their hardiness and resilience. Unlike many modern roses, antique roses generally require less maintenance, are more resistant to disease, and adapt well to various climates. They don't need much fertilizer or pruning, and they can thrive with minimal intervention.

But perhaps what I love most about antique roses is their connection to history. Each time I walk through my garden, I'm reminded that the same roses that grow in my backyard once grew in medieval European gardens, ancient Chinese imperial courts, and Victorian English estates. These roses have been witnesses to centuries of human history.

As I place my cutting in the greenhouse, I think about the gardeners who came before me, carefully propagating these same varieties, ensuring their survival for future generations. I feel honored to be part of this living tradition, preserving these beautiful and historic plants for the gardeners who will come after me.`;

const PASSAGE_4_TEXT = `Jeremy Frey, Weaving Heritage Into Modern Art

[1]
The winning piece was a basket, it was eighteen inches tall with a curved, vaselike silhouette. It was made of ash wood finely woven into bold stripes of black and white that ran from its crown to its base.

In the ninety-year history of the Santa Fe Indian Market‚Äîthe largest Indian art festival in the nation‚Äîthe 2011 event marked the first time a basket won best of show. The creator of the piece, thirty-three-year-old Passamaquoddy Indian Jeremy Frey from Princeton, Maine, the basket sold at auction for $16,000.

[2]
Frey learned basket weaving from his mother, who learned from her mother, and so on through generations of Passamaquoddy basket makers. The tradition dates back hundreds of years, when Passamaquoddy people used baskets for storing food, carrying goods, and trading with European settlers.

Traditional Passamaquoddy baskets were made from ash trees that grew in the forests of Maine. Basket makers would harvest strips of ash wood, pound them to separate the growth rings, and weave the thin strips into sturdy, functional baskets. The baskets were often decorated with natural dyes made from plants and minerals.

Frey continues these traditional techniques but also brings his own artistic vision to his work. He experiments with different patterns, shapes, and color combinations. His baskets are not just functional objects but works of art that honor his cultural heritage while pushing the boundaries of the craft.

The recognition Frey received at the Santa Fe Indian Market was a testament to his skill and creativity. It also brought attention to the rich tradition of Native American basket weaving and the artists who keep this tradition alive today.`;

const PASSAGE_5_TEXT = `The Flow of Time

Nine hundred years ago, Emperor Zhezong of China, ordered the design and construction of a clock built to keep time more accurately than other clocks. This would be no simple timepiece and because Chinese dynasties continued to astrology, they relied on complicated clocks that not only kept time but also helped track stars, planets, the sun, and the moon. An eminent scientist and bureaucrat named Su Song lead Zhezong's ambitious project.

Using his expertise in calendrical science, Su Song designed a clock tower that stood over 30 feet tall. The tower housed an elaborate mechanism powered by water. A large water wheel turned continuously, moving a complex system of gears and wheels that drove the clock's many functions.

The clock displayed the time on several different scales. One display showed the hour of the day using a traditional Chinese system that divided the day into twelve two-hour periods. Another display tracked the positions of celestial bodies. Mechanical figures appeared at regular intervals to ring bells and gongs, announcing the hours.

What made Su Song's clock remarkable was its use of an escapement mechanism‚Äîa device that regulated the flow of power to the clock's gears, ensuring that the clock kept accurate time. This was one of the earliest known uses of an escapement in a mechanical clock, predating similar developments in European clockmaking by several centuries.

Unfortunately, Su Song's clock tower did not survive. When the Jin dynasty conquered northern China in 1127, they dismantled the clock and attempted to rebuild it in their capital. However, no one understood how it worked, and it was never successfully reconstructed. Today, we know about Su Song's clock tower only through detailed descriptions and diagrams that Su Song himself created.

Despite its loss, Su Song's clock remains an important milestone in the history of timekeeping. It demonstrates the sophistication of Chinese science and engineering in the medieval period and reminds us that technological innovation occurred in many parts of the world, often independently of one another.`;
