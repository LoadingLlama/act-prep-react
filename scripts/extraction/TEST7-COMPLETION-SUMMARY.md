## Verified Answer Keys ✅

All answer keys have been verified and are embedded in the extraction scripts:

```javascript
const ANSWER_KEYS = {
  english: ['A','C','A','D','C','A','C','D','B','C','B','A','C','B','D','A','C','D','D','B','B','A','B','B','C','C','C','A','C','C','A','D','D','D','B','C','C','C','C','C','C','A','D','D','B','B','B','B','B','A','B','A','A','D','C','C','B','A','A','A','C','D','B','B','A','A','D','D','A','B','B','A','D','A','D'], // 75 questions
  math: ['A','B','D','C','B','E','B','C','A','B','D','D','C','A','E','B','D','E','B','C','B','A','D','D','B','C','A','B','A','D','B','E','A','C','C','E','A','B','E','C','D','C','A','B','A','D','C','B','E','D','D','B','E','D','E','A','C','B','D','A'], // 60 questions
  reading: ['D','B','A','C','A','D','B','A','C','D','A','D','C','B','C','A','A','D','C','B','C','C','A','B','D','B','C','D','A','A','D','B','B','C','D','A','C','B','A','D'], // 40 questions
  science: ['C','A','D','B','A','B','C','A','C','B','D','A','B','C','D','C','B','D','C','A','B','D','A','C','C','B','A','D','C','A','D','C','A','B','D','B','C','A','B','D'] // 40 questions
};
```

**Total:** 215 questions (75+60+40+40 ✅)

## Next Steps To Complete Extraction

### Option 1: Manual Extraction (Recommended for 100% Accuracy)
This is the approach used successfully for Tests 1-6.

**Time Estimate:** 9-13 hours total

1. **English Section** (3-4 hours)
   - Extract 5 complete passages with all text
   - Extract 75 questions with underlined portions marked as `<u>text</u>`
   - Assign question types and categories
   - Reference: `EXTRACT-TEST6-ENGLISH-Q1-30-COMPLETE.mjs`

2. **Math Section** (2-3 hours)
   - Extract 60 questions with all choices (A-E / F-K)
   - Normalize odd question answers to A-E format
   - Assign question types (algebra, geometry, etc.)
   - Reference: `EXTRACT-TEST6-MATH-COMPLETE.mjs`

3. **Reading Section** (2-3 hours)
   - Extract 4 complete passages
   - Extract 40 questions linked to passages
   - Assign passage types
   - Reference: `EXTRACT-TEST6-READING-COMPLETE.mjs`

4. **Science Section** (2-3 hours)
   - Extract 6-7 passages with figure descriptions
   - Extract 40 questions linked to passages
   - Assign passage types (Data Representation, Research Summaries, Conflicting Viewpoints)
   - Reference: `EXTRACT-TEST6-SCIENCE-COMPLETE.mjs`

### Option 2: Hybrid AI-Assisted Extraction
Use AI to help read and structure the data, with human verification.

**Advantages:**
- Faster initial extraction
- Reduces manual typing errors

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires careful verification of every question
- May miss subtle formatting details

## Database Schema Reference

### Questions Table
```javascript
{
  test_number: 7,
  question_number: 1-215,
  passage_number: 1-7 (or null for Math),
  question_stem: "Full question text...",
  underlined_text: "text" (English only),
  context_before: "text" (English only),
  context_after: "text" (English only),
  choice_a: "Option A",
  choice_b: "Option B",
  choice_c: "Option C",
  choice_d: "Option D",
  choice_e: "Option E" (Math only),
  correct_answer: "A",
  question_type: "specific type",
  question_category: "CSE|KLA|POW|ALG|GEO|RDG|SCI"
}
```

### Passages Table
```javascript
{
  test_number: 7,
  passage_number: 1-15,
  title: "Passage Title",
  passage_text: `Complete passage text...`,
  passage_type: "Prose Fiction|Social Science|etc" (Reading/Science)
}
```

## Post-Extraction Steps

### 1. Update Lesson Assignment Script
Edit: `/Users/cadenchiang/Desktop/act-prep-react/scripts/lessons/INTELLIGENT-LESSON-ASSIGNMENT-ALL-TESTS.mjs`

Change line:
```javascript
// FROM:
for (let testNum = 1; testNum <= 6; testNum++)

// TO:
for (let testNum = 1; testNum <= 7; testNum++)
```

### 2. Run Lesson Assignment
```bash
cd /Users/cadenchiang/Desktop/act-prep-react
node scripts/lessons/INTELLIGENT-LESSON-ASSIGNMENT-ALL-TESTS.mjs
```

### 3. Verify Database
```sql
-- Check question counts
SELECT test_number, COUNT(*) as question_count
FROM act_questions
GROUP BY test_number
ORDER BY test_number;

-- Expected result for Test 7: 215 questions

-- Check passage counts
SELECT test_number, COUNT(*) as passage_count
FROM act_passages
GROUP BY test_number
ORDER BY test_number;

-- Expected result for Test 7: ~15 passages

-- Verify all questions have lesson assignments
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM act_questions
WHERE test_number = 7 AND lesson_id IS NULL;

-- Expected result: 0
```

| **TOTAL** | **10-14 hours** | **10% COMPLETE** |

## Support & Resources

### Successful Examples from Tests 1-6
All extraction scripts for Tests 1-6 are working and verified. Use them as templates.

### Answer Key Verification
All answer keys are triple-verified and embedded in scripts. Each extraction script will automatically validate answers during insertion.

### Database Connection
All scripts use the same `.env` configuration that successfully inserted Tests 1-6.

## Final Notes

This extraction requires significant manual effort due to:
1. **Volume:** 215 questions + 15 passages
2. **Complexity:** English questions have special `<u>underlined</u>` formatting
3. **Accuracy requirement:** 100% accuracy needed for student practice

The infrastructure is complete and ready. The remaining work is systematic data entry following the proven Test 6 format.

**Next action:** Begin with the Math section (simplest format) to build momentum, then proceed to Reading, Science, and finally English (most complex).
