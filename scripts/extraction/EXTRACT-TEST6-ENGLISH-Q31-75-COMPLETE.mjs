  passage_number: 3,
  title: "Rescuing the Lord Howe Stick Insect",
  passage_text: `[1]
Two men ascend the face of Ball's Pyramid‚Äîa rocky island in the Tasman Sea that looks like a mountain jutting up from the waves. The men, Nicholas Carlile and Dean Hiscox, have cameras and flashlights; it is dark. They are heading for a specific melaleuca bush that is hanging 225 feet above the ocean. When they reach it, they find twenty-four enormous black insects. Wingless and up to fifteen inches long, the men see Dryococelus australis‚Äîa nocturnal species that had been believed to be extinct for over eighty years.

[2]
Dryococelus australis, also known as the Lord Howe stick insect, is native to Lord Howe Island, located less than fifteen miles to Ball's Pyramid. [A] The insects are so large that 1800s European sailors called them "tree lobsters." The animals thrived on Lord Howe Island until 1918, when a British supply ship ran aground while the ship was being repaired, rats escaped onto the island and quickly wiped out the stick insects.

[3]
By 1920, the insects were presumed to be extinct. For decades, though the island's remote location and dangerous waters made a thorough search difficult, so the insects' survival wasn't confirmed until 2001. [B]

[4]
Carlile and Hiscox's find raised a question‚Äîwhat should be done with the rare insects? In 2003, the Australian government permitted the removal of four insects from the island in order to bring the species back in the brink of extinction. [C] Two of the insects were transported to the Melbourne Zoo, where invertebrate conservation expert Patrick Honan, took charge of it. Starting with only thirty eggs, Honan was able to activate the population of these rare insects. [D]

[5]
Though the species is now safe, the insects' fame is spreading. Some stick insects will remain at the zoo as an "insurance population," but the ultimate goal is to reintroduce the insects to their native habitat on Lord Howe Island.`

const passage4 = {
  test_number: TEST_NUMBER,
  passage_number: 4,
  title: "Morse Code in the Modern Age",
  passage_text: `[1]
Before texting, e-mail, and even the telephone call, there was Morse code. Transmitted over telegraph wire or radio waves via pulses of electric current, Morse code, which was used for over a century, the standard for rapid long-distance communication, especially for those at sea. [A] In 1995, however, the US Coast Guard suspended it's usage of Morse code, including the international distress signal SOS. Despite the speed and precision of technologies such as global positioning satellites, decoding signals in Morse code had become inefficient.

[2]
To some, the decision signaled the end of Morse code. Morse code's enduring utility, they argue, lays in the fact that it functions less like a technology then a language‚Äîone that can reliably transmit a message under almost any conditions. [B]

[3]
In Morse code, each letter of the unique Roman alphabet consists of a pattern of short and long signals called dots and dashes. [C] Though Morse code was used longer than any electrical coding system, spelling out and translating messages in Morse code does not require specialized machines. Messages can be transmitted by clicking a flashlight on and off, by flashing a mirror in the sun, or simply blinking. [D] The code can also be spoken aloud, with the words dit and dah substituted for dots and dashes, or rendered rhythmically, allowing people to communicate via handheld buzzers.

[4]
Because of its versatility, Morse code can prove valuable in ensuring public safety when more sophisticated equipment fails. Air traffic controllers can revert to Morse code if radar or satellite signals are interrupted. Similarly, amateur radio operators can use the code during weather emergencies to solicit information from outside the affected area. The news is relayed by them, by which they can keep people safe and informed.

New communication technologies will continue to emerge, meanwhile Morse code, with its lack of sophistication, could remain just as effective an asset.`

// PASSAGE 5: Urban Legend

const passage5 = {
  test_number: TEST_NUMBER,
  passage_number: 5,
  title: "Urban Legend",
  passage_text: `On a concrete pillar just a few meters from the Eiffel Tower, painted letters spell out, "This is not a photo opportunity." On the sands of the Bristol Channel, a large, spray-painted, "X" promises buried treasure. On the side of a building in London, a stenciled image depicts a pair of uniformed soldiers painting a vibrant red peace sign. Although nearly no one knows what this artist looks like, there are many who know his work. Blending sharp-tongued social commentary with humor and whimsy British-born artist, Banksy, has made a name for himself by challenging people's perceptions of the relevance of street art.

In the beginning, Banksy's fame originated on the streets of Bristol, England, in the early 1990s. Under the cover of the night sky, Banksy worked quickly and steadily, sometimes painting freehand, sometimes spray-painting elaborately detailed stencils.

Concerned residents argued that Banksy's work was simply graffiti that encouraged vandalism. Others praised it as art done by and for the people and debated for more.

England's strict anti-graffiti policy meant that most of Banksy's pieces were destroyed within mere hours of there completion.

Afterward, only a blank wall stood where Banksy's art had been. By the end of the decade, Banksy had expanded his influence, painting his messages in places well beyond the British border. Seemingly he is everywhere and nowhere at once, Banksy had the full attention of the art world. Museum directors organized Banksy exhibitions, and auctioneers sold actual pieces of buildings that bore Banksy's artistry.

Despite his popularity, Banksy has not given in to the hype. He does not reproduce and sell prints of his images for profit. He also continues to communicate with the public through his street art, which is possible in part because he has managed to keep his identity secret. In Banksy's own words, "Art is not like other culture because its success is not made by its audience."`
