    title: "Making the Desert Bloom",
    content: `Making the Desert Bloom

More than two thousand years ago, a people the Romans called the Garamantes created a complex civilization in one of the world's driest places—the Sahara Desert. Beginning around 500 BCE, they built towns and villages, manufactured cloth and jewelry, and traded throughout North Africa and the Mediterranean. They also grew a variety of crops, including wheat, barley, and millet.

The survival of their civilization depended on hundreds of miles of underground tunnels. These tunnels carried water to desert settlements from an aquifer, an underground layer of water-bearing rock. The Garamantes learned to build foggaras (underground aqueducts) by digging vertical shafts down to the water table, then connecting them with horizontal tunnels. When the tunnels reached a town or field, the water flowed into more easily accessible surface canals or reservoirs.

Archaeologists don't know how the Garamantes learned to build foggaras. Other such systems were built in Persia and other parts of the ancient world, but there is no evidence of contact between these civilizations. And because the water came from an aquifer rather than from rainfall, the supply was dependable. The Garamantes could rely on a constant supply of water for drinking, washing, and irrigation. Moreover, the cold, damp air of the foggaras lowered the temperature inside the homes, providing a form of ancient air conditioning.

The Garamantes thrived until about 500 CE, when some archaeologists believe their water supply began to run low. As the foggaras supplied less and less water, the Garamantes' population declined, and their civilization eventually collapsed. However, at least six hundred of the foggaras have survived to this day. The stone mounds that mark their ventilation shafts are still visible in what is now southwestern Libya.`

    title: "Celtic Mouth Music",
    content: `Celtic Mouth Music

In the Gaelic-speaking regions of Scotland and Ireland, a musical tradition known as "mouth music" has been practiced for centuries. This vocal technique, called puirt à beul in Scottish Gaelic and port a' bhéil in Irish Gaelic, involves singing rhythmic syllables and phrases that mimic the sounds and patterns of traditional dance music.

Mouth music emerged as a practical solution when musical instruments were not available or when the expense of hiring musicians was prohibitive. At social gatherings, weddings, and community events, singers would provide dance accompaniment by vocalizing the melodic and rhythmic patterns typically played on fiddles, pipes, or other traditional instruments. The rapid-fire syllables and nonsense words created an infectious energy that could sustain dancers through long celebrations.

The technique requires considerable skill and practice. Singers must maintain steady rhythms while articulating complex patterns of consonants and vowels. Traditional mouth music incorporates specific syllabic formulas that have been passed down through generations, though skilled practitioners often improvise new variations. The vocal style emphasizes rhythm over melody, with singers using their voices as percussion instruments to drive the dance forward.

In recent decades, Celtic mouth music has experienced a remarkable revival. Contemporary Celtic bands and musicians have embraced this ancient tradition, incorporating mouth music into modern recordings and live performances. The bands' popularity continually grows as they combine traditional mouth music with modern rhythms, introducing this unique vocal art form to audiences worldwide through albums and dance concerts around the world.`

    title: "Neutrinos on Ice",
    content: `Neutrinos on Ice

At the IceCube Neutrino Observatory in Antarctica, eighty-six cables descend 2,500 meters into the glacial terrain. Each cable is equipped with sixty digital optical modules (DOMs), which are programmed to detect a faint blue flash known as Cherenkov radiation. This radiation—a veritable shock wave of photonic energy—is emitted when subatomic particles called neutrinos collide with electrons in the molecules of ice.

Neutrinos are among the most abundant particles in the universe, but they are also among the most elusive. Practically weightless and electrically neutral, neutrinos are rarely affected by matter or electromagnetic fields. For this reason, many neutrinos have been traveling through space unimpeded for billions of years. Fifty trillion neutrinos pass through your body every second, yet you never feel them because they almost never interact with other particles.

On some occasions, however, neutrinos do collide with other particles. Scientists specifically selected the site of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory to facilitate the detection of such a collision. Not only is the Antarctic subterranean ice exceptionally clear, it is also less pressurized due to its subzero altitude. Once this detection occurs, data is gathered and transferred to laboratories at the University of Wisconsin.

Determining neutrinos' origins could provide scientists with new insights into the universe. For instance, some neutrinos are produced during supernovae (the collapsing of stars). The origins of these neutrinos could give us invaluable information about how, when, and why stars collapse. By tracking neutrinos from deep space, scientists hope to learn more about the most violent events in the universe at our galaxy—and galaxies beyond.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory represents a new frontier in astronomy, one that uses particles rather than light to explore the cosmos. As scientists continue to detect and analyze neutrinos from distant cosmic events, they are building a more complete picture of how the universe works.`

    title: "Clinton Hill's Found Artist",
    content: `Clinton Hill's Found Artist

At the Urban Vintage, my favorite café here in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, I was reading the newspaper when I noticed an article about Rafael Leonardo Black, a 64-year-old Clinton Hill artist who had just been discovered. Black, a native of Aruba, has been creating art in his New York City studio apartment for over three decades. However, in May of 2013, art dealer Francis Naumann, directed to Black's art by one of Black's longtime friends, displayed sixteen of the artist's drawings in a solo show. Within days, ten of Black's pieces sold for prices ranging from $16,000 to $28,000.

Black draws collages in black No. 2 pencil on white board and they're packed with depictions of ancient myths, historical events, and popular culture. One work that caught my attention was a piece called Seven Lamps. It features a representation of a British psychedelic poster, a portrayal of Danish surrealist painter Wilhelm Freddie at work, and a tiny figure of Los Angeles architect Simon Rodia. I wasn't sure how the drawings in Seven Lamps—so detailed that I could see the folds in Rodia's clothing—fit together logically, but I liked that there was so much for me to puzzle over.

Maybe this complexity helps explain why Black's work created such a stir. The newspaper article claims Black is unmoved by the sudden interest in his art. Now that I know about him, when I walk home from the Urban Vintage tonight, I wonder if I'll pass the brownstone building where Black creates his fascinating, newly found art.

Fortunately, I found an online gallery featuring several of Black's works, including Seven Lamps. The web page included a key that identified the people, places, and events—most of which I had never even heard of—that Black portrays in this piece. After studying the key, I realized that Black's art is like a visual encyclopedia, combining disparate elements from across time and culture into coherent artistic statements.`

    title: "Cher Ami, Pigeon Hero",
    content: `Cher Ami, Pigeon Hero

Pigeons have a fairly poor reputation. In many urban areas, they are considered little more than "rats with wings," blamed for spreading disease and despoiling statues. However, one species, the homing pigeon, is among the best navigators of the natural world. Their navigational abilities have earned the homely pigeon an undeniable place in history.

Before modern technologies like the radio or telephone, commanders on the battlefield often faced challenges in communicating, depending on their location. The homing pigeon provided a solution to this problem. It flew high. And it always quickly returned to its home roost. One of six hundred birds used by the US Army Signal Corps in France during World War I, Cher Ami flew twelve successful missions.

Cher Ami's most famous flight took place in October 1918, during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. American forces had advanced deep into German territory when a battalion of the 77th Infantry Division found itself trapped behind enemy lines. The men were surrounded by German troops and were rapidly running out of rations. They were separated from other US forces. They had but one link to headquarters: homing pigeons.

As it became clear that the Americans were unaware of the 77th's whereabouts, the situation grew dire. The battalion released two pigeons with messages requesting help, but both birds were shot down by German fire. Cher Ami was their last hope. When released, the bird immediately came under enemy fire. A bullet pierced his breast, another shattered his leg, but still Cher Ami flew on. Twenty-five minutes later, he reached his destination, delivering the message that would save 194 American soldiers.

News reports around the world touted the bird's heroism. The French military awarded Cher Ami a medal, the War Cross. Although one might question the extent to which Cher Ami understood his mission, his story proves that pigeons are unique creatures capable of remarkable acts. Cher Ami's story is testimony to the homing pigeon's navigational skill and instinct.`
