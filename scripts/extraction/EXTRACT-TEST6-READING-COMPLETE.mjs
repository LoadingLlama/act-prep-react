    title: "LITERARY NARRATIVE: Introduction by Charlotte Noruzi",
    passage_type: "LITERARY_NARRATIVE",
    passage_text: `When my family first moved to the United States, my father was still traveling back and forth to Iran before joining us permanently. After one trip, he brought with him a small collection of Iranian children's books. These books, along with numerous others, were created under the Kanoon Parvaresh Fekri Koodakan va Nojavanan (Institute for the Intellectual Development of Children and Adolescents). To me, its iconic stylized rooster logo conveyed a positive and bright outlook for the betterment of children. In 1961, the Kanoon was established to enhance the quality and educational standards of children's literature and activities. A large part of the program was devoted to the publishing of high-quality, richly written and illustrated books for children and adolescents.

I have six books from that era. They were loaded with cultural and historical references and set apart from each other and from my American children's books in their individual and unique styles of illustration.

In times where I felt the most disconnected, the most doubtful of my identity, I would turn to these books, get lost in them, in the fantasy of them. They were my one connection to the culture I left behind. In them I found some remnant of my past life. I would open a book and feel like I was "home" again. I see now how the seeds to express my thoughts and ideas through pictures were sown. Out of the endearing times I spent with my little collection sprung the desire to illustrate books, to use calligraphy and hand-written text. This was my introduction to art and words living together and there's a little from each book in some aspect of my work, my own children's book.

My favorite of the collection is called Marmoolak Koochak Otagheh Man (My Room's Little Lizard) by Farshid Mesqali. Its surrealistic watercolors draw you into the realm of dreams. The hand lettering of the book's title and the deep black, blues, greens and purples that bleed softly into one another, making up the body of the lizard, were so beguiling to me. They still are. I see the influence in my own work. Baba Barfi was another, done in gorgeous hues of blue and greys, in a mix of drawing and watercolor. There is a quiet simplicity in the illustrations and the story that reminds me of the silence right after snowfall.

About 12 years ago, my mother visited Iran and brought back with her another set of children's books. These happened to be illustrated by an important figure from my childhood: Gholamali Maktabi, someone I hadn't thought of in years. I never until now got the message of the giving of all these books, first by my father and again by my mother. I had tucked Maktabi's wonderful books away in my memory all of these years and not until the idea for this essay presented itself, did I bring them out into the light. And he came out along with them.

Gholamali Maktabi was my father's dear and lifelong friend from their school days. He was a part of our family and we endearingly called him "Dhayee Maktabi," which means Uncle Maktabi in Farsi. I remember a sense of warmth always surrounding that name. I knew him first as the person behind the poignant, sensitive photographs taken of us in Iran as we were growing up. The images he recorded have served time and again as windows into my childhood, my personality as a child, images that connect me with who I was. His innate ability to capture with such simplicity and affection the smile or frown of a child can also be seen in his lifework as an illustrator of children's books. Dhayee Maktabi would spend time drawing with my sister and me when we were children.

In October 2007, after more than 30 years, I called Dhayee Maktabi. No time, it felt, had gone by. "I was drawn from a young age to painting," Maktabi remembers. "This interest ultimately led to my desire to become an illustrator and slowly began to replace painting for meâ€”though to this day I still have a special love for drawing and painting. I've spent about forty years illustrating children's and adolescents' books and I expect that I will continue to do this for the foreseeable future. The thing that has always attracted me to illustrating for children and adolescents is the world that they inhabit, one which is full of mysteries and secrets."

Indeed, I believe that those photographic portraits of my family done long ago also served this purpose. My mother told me recently that Maktabi loved to just sit and observe us, our games and antics, our "secret worlds" that, through the small window of his shutter, were lovingly revealed.`

    title: "SOCIAL SCIENCE: Down on the Batture by Oliver A. Houck",
    passage_type: "SOCIAL_SCIENCE",
    passage_text: `The Mississippi River batture is unique. Here we have a place that is neither water nor land; it is both. It depends on the time of year. Spanish and French traditions going back to the time of Rome recognized public rights to public things. The civil code declared that rivers and their banks were public, which would have closed the matter. But in the late 1700s along came Edward Livingston, a New Yorker with an American notion of private property, a keen legal mind, a nose for money, and an ambition as big as the Ritz.

Livingston's accomplishments in the courthouse and the legislature remain monuments today, but the case that made him famous was about dirt on the banks of the Mississippi at a prime location in downtown New Orleans. Livingston and his client who claimed the dirt stood to make a fortune. Indeed, Livingston declined a fee in the case. Instead, if he won he would get a piece of the victory, the most valuable real estate in New Orleans.

The American notion of property was not popular in New Orleans, whose people were accustomed to using the banks of rivers to beach their boats, promenade, fish, swim, rake mussels, and even take fill for their front yards. By precedent rising from centuries, the Mississippi batture was common ground. In a city oppressed by heat, the batture was also treasured ground, the place where everyone in society from cotton brokers to boat hands could enjoy the breeze, air pleasant to inhale, and the very sight of the river. When Livingston's client undertook to develop the batture he was claiming, a public mob arrived to interrupt his work. Every day.

Livingston's client made a frontal assault. He went out at low water, diked off the batture, and then arrested people coming to take the river sand in the old and accustomed way. The ensuing lawsuits rivaled the twists and turns of a Dickens novel. On one side was Livingston, claiming that private property was sacred in America. On the other was a who's who of wellborn local names right on up to the president of the United States. Thomas Jefferson considered the public character of the Mississippi to be a civic right and essential to his ambitions for settling the West. After Livingston won his first case, Jefferson had U.S. marshals evict him from the batture anyway, at which point Livingston sued the officer who evicted him. It got that bad.

When the dust settled, years later, Livingston emerged with his property deed, but he had ceded important claims to the city, including part of his real estate and development controls on the rest. Compromise that it was, the New Orleans batture would go from small wharves and open space to an impressive accumulation of mega-wharves and warehouses. New Orleaneans not only could no longer access the river; they could no longer even see it.

Enter Robert Livingston, Edward's brother, with an even more impressive list of accomplishments and a yet bigger coup in mind. He and Robert Fulton, who had either invented the steamboat or made a quick copy of someone else's, depending on your source, tendered an offer to New Orleans that it could not refuse, a monopoly on the Mississippi River.

Fulton's steamboat had one huge advantage for the future of the city; it could go upriver. The early flatboats didn't even try. Fulton's new boat could get back up in a week, although he had not exactly done it yet. The Fulton-Livingston team proposed a deal. They would deliver steamboat commerce to New Orleans, if the city would grant them all rights to the river trade. They would own the river.

Enter another challenger. Henry Shreve came from the Red River in northwestern Louisiana and saw Livingston's monopoly as a threat to the future of his region. He built his own steamship, sailed it down to New Orleans, loaded it with goods, and sailed back home again to a hero's welcome. People did that sort of thing back then. Fulton had only talked about going back upriver. Now Shreve had actually done it, and with merchandise on board. More threatening, Shreve tried it again. Livingston had to make his move, and so, as the second Shreve boat was ready to leave New Orleans with its cargo, he had the captain and the boat arrested.

The public sided against the Livingstons, as it had on the batture cases earlier, causing a small riot. Shreve was released the next day. A few months later a local judge dismissed the lawsuit. Edward Livingston might own a piece of the batture, but Robert would not own the river.`

    title: "HUMANITIES: Passage A - Searching for Silence: John Cage's Art of Noise by Alex Ross / Passage B - This Is Your Brain on Music by Daniel J. Levitin",
    passage_type: "HUMANITIES",
    passage_text: `Passage A by Alex Ross

On August 29, 1952, David Tudor walked onto the stage of the Maverick Concert Hall, near Woodstock, New York, sat down at the piano, and, for four and a half minutes, made no sound. He was performing "4'33"," a conceptual work by John Cage. It has been called the "silent piece," but its purpose is to make people listen. "There's no such thing as silence," Cage said, recalling the premiere. "You could hear the wind stirring outside during the first movement. During the second, raindrops began pattering the roof, and during the third people themselves made all kinds of interesting sounds as they talked or walked out."

Composer and scholar Kyle Gann defines "4'33"" as "an act of framing, of enclosing environmental and unintended sounds in a moment of attention in order to open the mind to the fact that all sounds are music." That last thought ruled Cage's life: he wanted to discard inherited structures, open doors to the exterior world, "let sounds be just sounds." Gann writes, "It begged for a new approach to listening, perhaps even a new understanding of music itself, a blurring of the conventional boundaries between art and life."

On a simpler level, Cage had an itch to try new things. What would happen if you sat at a piano and did nothing? If you chose among an array of musical possibilities by flipping a coin and consulting the I Ching? If you made music from junkyard percussion, squads of radios, the scratching of pens, an amplified cactus?

Many people, of course, won't hear of it. Nearly six decades after the work came into the world, "4'33"" is still dismissed as "absolutely ridiculous," "stupid," and "a gimmick." Such judgments are especially common within classical music where Cage, who died in 1992, remains an object of widespread scorn.

Morton Feldman, another avant-garde musician, once said, "John Cage was the first composer in the history of music who raised the question by implication that maybe music could be an art form rather than a musical form." Feldman meant that, since the Middle Ages, even the most adventurous composers had labored within a craftsmanlike tradition. Cage held that an artist can work as freely with sound as with paint: he changed what it meant to be a composer, and every kid manipulating music on a laptop is in his debt. Not everything he did was laudable, or even tolerable. Yet the work remains inescapable, mesmerizing, and often unexpectedly touching. It encompasses some of the most violent sounds of the twentieth century, as well as some of the most gently beguiling. It confronts us with the elemental question of what music is, and confounds all easy answers.

Passage B by Daniel J. Levitin

The music of many avant-garde composers stretches the bounds of what most of us think music is. Going beyond the use of melody and harmony, and even beyond the use of instruments, these composers use recordings of found objects in the world such as jackhammers, trains, and waterfalls. They edit the recordings, play with their pitch, and ultimately combine them into an organized collage of sound with the same type of emotional trajectoryâ€”the same tension and releaseâ€”as traditional music. Composers in this tradition are like the painters who stepped outside the boundaries of representational and realistic artâ€”the cubists, the Dadaists, many of the modern painters from Picasso to Kandinsky.

What do the music of Bach and John Cage fundamentally have in common? On the most basic level, what distinguishes Busta Rhymes's "What's It Gonna Be?!" or Beethoven's "PathÃ©tique" Sonata from, say, the collection of sounds you'd hear standing in the middle of Times Square or those you'd hear deep in a rainforest? As the composer Edgard VarÃ©se famously defined it, "Music is organized sound."

It is helpful to examine what music is made of. What are the fundamental building blocks of music? And how, when organized, do they give rise to music? The basic elements of any sound are loudness, pitch, contour, duration (or rhythm), tempo, timbre, spatial location, and reverberation. Our brains organize these fundamental perceptual attributes into higher-level conceptsâ€”just as a painter arranges lines into forms. When we listen to music, we are actually perceiving multiple attributes.

Each attribute can be varied without altering the others. The difference between music and a random or disordered set of sounds has to do with the way these fundamental attributes combine, and the relations that form between them.`

    title: "NATURAL SCIENCE: How We Are Evolving by Jonathan K. Pritchard",
    passage_type: "NATURAL_SCIENCE",
    passage_text: `A few years ago it was extremely difficult for scientists to trace our species' genetic responses to our environment; the needed tools just did not exist. All that changed with the completion of the human genome sequence and the subsequent cataloguing of genetic variation. To understand exactly what we did, it helps to know a bit about how DNA is structured and how small changes can affect its function. The human genome sequence consists of about three billion pairs of DNA nucleotides, or "letters," that serve as an instruction manual for how to assemble a human. The manual is now known to contain a parts list of about 20,000 genesâ€”strings of DNA letters that spell out the information required to build proteins. (Proteins, which include enzymes, do much of the work in cells.) About 2 percent of the human genome encodes proteins, and a roughly similar amount seems to be involved in gene regulation. Most of the rest of the genome has no known role.

Overall the genomes of any two people are extremely similar, differing in only about one out of every 1,000 nucleotide pairs. Sites where one nucleotide pair substitutes for another are referred to as single-nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs (pronounced "snips"), and the alternative versions of the DNA at each SNP are called alleles. Because most of the genome does not encode proteins or regulate genes, most SNPs probably have no measurable effect on the individual. But if a SNP occurs in a region of the genome that does have a coding or regulating function, it may affect the structure or function of a protein or where and how much of the protein is made. In this way, SNPs can conceivably modify almost any trait, be it height, eye color, ability to digest milk, or susceptibility to diseases.

When natural selection strongly favors a particular allele, it becomes more common in the population with each generation, while the disfavored allele becomes less common. Eventually, if the environment remains stable, the beneficial allele will spread until everyone in the population carries it, at which point it has become fixed in that group. This process typically takes many generations. In theory, a helpful allele could become fixed in as little as a few hundred years if it conferred an extraordinarily large advantage. Conversely, a less advantageous allele could take many thousands of years to spread.

It would be great if in our efforts to understand recent human evolution, we could obtain DNA samples from ancient remains and actually track the changes of favored alleles over time. But DNA usually degrades quickly in ancient samples, thereby hindering this approach. Research groups around the world have developed methods of examining genetic variation in modern-day humans for signs of natural selection that has happened in the past.

One such tactic is to comb DNA data from many different people for stretches that show few differences in SNP alleles within a population. The spread of selected alleles by natural selection can leave distinctive patterns in the SNP data: if an existing allele suddenly proves particularly helpful when a population finds itself in new circumstances, that allele can reach high frequency (while remaining rare in other populations).

Over the past few years multiple studies have identified several hundred genome signals of apparent natural selection that occurred within the past 60,000 years or so. In a few of these cases, scientists have a pretty good grasp on the selective pressures and the adaptive benefit of the favored allele. For example, among dairy-farming populations in Europe, the Middle East and East Africa, the region of the genome that houses the gene for the lactase enzyme that digests lactose (the sugar in milk) shows clear signs of having been the target of strong selection. In most populations, babies are born with the ability to digest lactose, but the lactase gene turns off after weaning, leaving people unable to digest lactose as adults. Writing in the American Journal of Human Genetics in 2004, a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimated that variants of the lactase gene that remain active into adulthood achieved high frequency in European dairy-farming groups in just 5,000 to 10,000 years. In 2006 a group led by Sarah Tishkoff, who is now at the University of Pennsylvania, reported in Nature Genetics that they had found rapid evolution of the lactase gene in East African dairy-farming populations. These changes were surely an adaptive response to a new subsistence practice.`
