# PRACTICE TEST 5 - EXTRACTION PLAN
**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Goal:** Extract Practice Test 5 with 100% accuracy using manual review approach

---

## üìã EXTRACTION STRATEGY

Based on our successful extraction of Tests 1-4, we will use the **MANUAL EXTRACTION** approach with the following workflow:

### Phase 1: Setup & Answer Keys ‚úÖ
1. ‚úÖ Read and analyze Test 5 source files
2. ‚è≥ Extract answer keys (IN PROGRESS - manual entry required)

### Phase 2: English Section (75 questions + 5 passages)
1. Extract passage titles and text
2. Extract questions manually (Q1-Q75)
3. Assign lesson_id to each question
4. Verify format: `context_before + <u>underlined_text</u> + context_after`

### Phase 3: Math Section (60 questions)
1. Extract questions manually (Q1-Q60)
2. Assign lesson_id to each question
3. Ensure all 5 choices (A-E) present

### Phase 4: Reading Section (40 questions + 4 passages)
1. Extract 4 passages with titles, types, and text
2. Extract questions manually (Q1-Q40)
3. Link questions to passages
4. Assign lesson_id to each question

### Phase 5: Science Section (40 questions + ~7 passages)
1. Extract passages with titles, types, and descriptions
2. Note which passages have figures
3. Extract questions manually (Q1-Q40)
4. Link questions to passages
5. Assign lesson_id to each question

### Phase 6: Verification
1. Run comprehensive accuracy check
2. Verify all 215 questions extracted
3. Verify all answer keys correct
4. Verify all passage linkages
5. Verify all lesson_id assignments
6. Create final extraction report

## üìä SOURCE FILES

**TXT File:** `/Users/cadenchiang/Desktop/actprep copy/actclass.org/practice acts/Practice ACT 5.txt`
- Total lines: 7,093
- Contains questions and passages (answer keys appear corrupted)

**PDF File:** `/Users/cadenchiang/Desktop/actprep copy/actclass.org/practice acts/ocr_Practice ACT 5.pdf`
- Use for visual verification
- Use for answer key verification
- Use for figure identification

---

## üéØ ANSWER KEYS (MANUAL ENTRY REQUIRED)

The answer keys from the TXT file appear to be OCR-corrupted. We need to manually verify and enter the answer keys from the PDF.

**Format:** We'll create a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "english": {
    "1": "C", "2": "J", "3": "B", ...
  },
  "math": {
    "1": "E", "2": "J", "3": "D", ...
  },
  "reading": {
    "1": "A", "2": "G", "3": "C", ...
  },
  "science": {
    "1": "C", "2": "H", "3": "B", ...
  }
}
```

**Note:** All answers should be normalized to A/B/C/D (or A-E for math) before insertion.
