    title: "Making the Desert Bloom",
    content: `Making the Desert Bloom

More than two thousand years ago, a people the Romans called the Garamantes created a complex civilization in one of the world's driest places‚Äîthe Sahara Desert. Beginning around 500 BCE, they built towns and villages, manufactured cloth and jewelry, and traded throughout North Africa and the Mediterranean. They also grew a variety of crops, including wheat, barley, and millet.

The survival of their civilization depended on hundreds of miles of underground tunnels. These tunnels carried water to desert settlements from an aquifer, an underground layer of water-bearing rock. The Garamantes learned to build foggaras (underground aqueducts) by digging vertical shafts down to the water table, then connecting them with horizontal tunnels. When the tunnels reached a town or field, the water flowed into more easily accessible surface canals or reservoirs.

Archaeologists don't know how the Garamantes learned to build foggaras. Other such tunnels existed in Iran, Algeria, Tunisia, and elsewhere. Because the canals were underground, the water they carried stayed clean and didn't evaporate. And because the water came from an aquifer rather than from rainfall, the supply was unaffected by drought. The Garamantes could rely on a constant supply of water for drinking, washing, and irrigation. Moreover, the cold, damp air of the foggaras lowered the temperature inside the homes that were built over them, resulting in an ancient form of air-conditioning.

The Garamantes thrived until about 500 CE, when some archaeologists believe they began to deplete the aquifer. As the foggaras supplied less and less water, the Garamantes' population declined, and their civilization eventually collapsed. However, at least six hundred of the ancient foggaras survive. The stone mounds that mark their ventilation shafts are still visible in what is now southwestern Libya.`

    title: "A Mouthful of Music",
    content: `A Mouthful of Music

Mouth music is the name given in English to the many ways of imitating the sounds of musical instruments with the human voice. Forms of mouth music are performed around the world, but the genre is particularly popular in England, Ireland, and Scotland. In this Celtic region, lilting and jigging are two of the lively names used to refer to this musical form.

Celtic mouth music exists to accompany dancing, so the rhythms and sounds are first-class and the words take a back seat. Instead of using traditional lyrics, singers often produce nonsense syllables, called vocables, to mimic instrumental music. These syllables are designed to replicate the sounds and rhythmic patterns of fiddles, pipes, and other traditional Celtic instruments.

One Scottish form of mouth music, puirt-a-beul, is performed entirely in the Gaelic language and accompanies traditional dance steps. The often tongue-twisting lyrics require much practice to perfect. The greater challenge for many puirt-a-beul singers, though, is learning when to breathe. A poorly timed breath might break a song's rhythm and disrupt the dancers' steps.

Puirt-a-beul was most likely invented out of necessity. Musical instruments were scarce in isolated Scottish villages, so to fill the void, mouth music emerged and provided residents with the music they wanted for dancing. Additionally, puirt-a-beul gave anyone who didn't read music a way to learn and pass on traditional songs.

Another form of mouth music that originated in Scotland is the waulking song. These work songs were traditionally sung by women as they prepared newly woven cloth by soaking, beating, and stretching it. The rhythmic nature of the work naturally lent itself to musical accompaniment, and the songs helped coordinate the workers' movements while making the labor more enjoyable.

The continuing popularity of Celtic mouth music is testament to its vitality. In the 1990s, groups like Mouth Music from Scotland and The Cranberries from Ireland rose to fame, exposing Celtic mouth music to audiences worldwide. The bands' celebrity continually survives as they combine traditional mouth music with modern rhythms, keeping this ancient art form alive for new generations.`

    title: "Neutrinos on Ice",
    content: `Neutrinos on Ice

At the IceCube Neutrino Observatory in Antarctica, eighty-six cables descend 2,500 meters into the glacial terrain. Each cable is equipped with sixty digital optical modules (DOMs), which are programmed to detect a faint blue flash known as Cherenkov radiation. This radiation‚Äîa veritable shock wave of photonic energy‚Äîis emitted when subatomic particles called neutrinos collide with electrons in the molecules of ice.

Although there are countless neutrinos in the universe (fifty trillion neutrinos pass through your body every second), actually detecting them is a formidable task. Neutrinos carry no electrical charge, are practically weightless, and travel at nearly the speed of light. Neutrinos are rarely affected by matter or electromagnetic fields. For this reason, many neutrinos have been traveling through space unimpeded for billions of years.

On some occasions, however, neutrinos do collide with other particles. Scientists specifically selected the site of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory to facilitate the detection of such a collision. Not only is the Antarctic subterranean ice exceptionally clear, it is also less pressurized due to its subzero altitude. Once this detection occurs, data is gathered and transferred to laboratories at the University of Wisconsin.

Determining neutrinos' origins could provide scientists with new insights into the universe. For instance, some neutrinos are produced during supernovae (the collapsing of stars). The origins of these neutrinos could give us invaluable information about how, when, and why stars collapse. By tracking neutrinos from deep space, scientists hope to learn more about the most violent events in the universe.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory represents a new frontier in astronomy, one that uses particles rather than light to explore the cosmos. As scientists continue to detect and analyze neutrinos from distant cosmic events, they are building a more complete picture of how the universe works. This particle-based approach to astronomy could revolutionize our understanding of space and lead to discoveries that traditional light-based telescopes could never achieve.`

    title: "Clinton Hill's Found Artist",
    content: `Clinton Hill's Found Artist

At the Urban Vintage, my favorite caf√© here in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, I was reading the newspaper when I noticed an article about Rafael Leonardo Black, a 64-year-old Clinton Hill artist who had just been discovered. Black, a native of Aruba, has been creating art in his New York City studio apartment for over three decades.

However, in May of 2013, art dealer Francis Naumann, directed to Black's art by one of Black's longtime friends, displayed sixteen of the artist's drawings in a solo show. The exhibition was an immediate success. Within days, ten of Black's pieces sold for prices ranging from $16,000 to $28,000. The art world had found a hidden treasure.

Black draws collages in black No. 2 pencil on white board, and they're packed with depictions of ancient myths, historical events, and popular culture. One work that caught my attention was a piece called Seven Lamps. It features a representation of a British psychedelic poster, a portrayal of Danish surrealist painter Wilhelm Freddie at work, and a tiny figure of Los Angeles architect Simon Rodia.

I wasn't sure how the drawings in Seven Lamps‚Äîso detailed that I could see the folds in Rodia's clothing‚Äîfit together logically, but I liked that there was so much for me to puzzle over. Maybe this complexity helps explain why Black's work created such a stir in the art world.

The newspaper article claims Black is unmoved by the sudden interest in his art. He continues to work quietly in his studio, focusing on his craft rather than the commercial success. Now that I know about him, when I walk home from the Urban Vintage, I wonder if I'll pass the brownstone building where Black creates his fascinating, newly found art.

Fortunately, I found an online gallery featuring several of Black's works, including Seven Lamps. The web page included a key that identified the people, places, and events‚Äîmost of which I had never even heard of‚Äîthat Black portrays in his pieces. After studying the key, I realized that Black's art is like a visual encyclopedia, combining disparate elements from across time and culture into coherent artistic statements that reward careful examination and research.`

    title: "Cher Ami, Pigeon Hero",
    content: `Cher Ami, Pigeon Hero

Pigeons have a fairly poor reputation. In many urban areas, they are considered little more than "rats with wings," blamed for spreading disease and despoiling statues. However, one species, the homing pigeon, is among the best navigators of the natural world. Their navigational abilities have earned the homely pigeon an undeniable place in history.

Before modern technologies like the radio or telephone, commanders on the battlefield often faced challenges in communicating, depending on their location. The homing pigeon provided a solution to this problem. It flew high and always quickly returned to its home roost. One of six hundred birds used by the US Army Signal Corps in France during World War I, Cher Ami flew twelve successful missions.

Cher Ami's most famous flight took place in October 1918, during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. American forces had advanced deep into German territory when a battalion of the 77th Infantry Division found itself trapped behind enemy lines. The men were surrounded by German troops and were rapidly running out of rations. They were separated from other US forces. They had but one link to headquarters: homing pigeons.

As it became clear that the Americans were unaware of the 77th's whereabouts, the situation grew dire. The battalion released two pigeons with messages requesting help, but both birds were shot down by German fire. Cher Ami was their last hope.

When released, the bird immediately came under enemy fire. A bullet pierced his breast, another shattered his leg, but still Cher Ami flew on. Twenty-five minutes later, he reached his destination, delivering the message that would save 194 American soldiers. The rescue mission was launched immediately, and the "Lost Battalion" was found and evacuated to safety.

News reports around the world touted the bird's heroism. The French military awarded Cher Ami a medal, the War Cross. Although one might question the extent to which Cher Ami understood his mission, his story proves that pigeons are remarkable creatures capable of extraordinary acts. Cher Ami's story is testimony to the homing pigeon's navigational skill and instinct, demonstrating that even in the most desperate circumstances, these birds can accomplish what seems impossible.`
