    title: 'Double the Manta Rays',
    introduction: 'Essay about marine biologist Andrea Marshall discovering two species of manta rays',
    passage_text: `There are thousands of new animal species identified each year, the vast majority are small or geographically isolated. So as graduate student Andrea Marshall studied manta rays, which are neither small nor isolated, she didn't expect to identify a new species. Mantas are plankton-eating relatives of stingrays that look like pairs of enormous black wings—up to twenty-five feet wide—flying slowly through the water. Encompassing wide swaths of both temperate and tropical oceans, the manta's range abuts every continent but Antarctica.

During Marshall's research off the coast of Mozambique, she observed intriguing physical variations in the mantas she swam amongst. Her beachside lodgings in Mozambique now house the Marine Megafauna Research Center. She began to suspect that the one recognized species of manta might in fact be two species.

To investigate, Marshall began collecting data. Other data required a closer look. The skin of all mantas, for example, is embedded with tiny, toothlike "denticles." Marshall found that denticles on some mantas were randomly spaced and occasionally overlapped, whereas denticles on other mantas were evenly spaced and never overlapped. Another discovery was that some mantas had egg-shaped masses at the base of their tail fins. Each mass contained a bony spine about an inch long—the vestige of a stinging barb from the manta's ancestors.

In 2009, Marshall announced, with two other scientists, that indeed there are two manta species. The reef manta, Manta alfredi, is the smaller and more common of the two. Thriving in shallow water, it rarely ventures far from its home territory. In contrast, the giant manta, Manta birostris, favors deep water and migrates thousands of miles a year.

The fact that such large animals went undifferentiated for so long highlights how little scientists know about these gentle giants. At the moment, manta ray populations face an array of threats worldwide. Fortunately, mantas have a devoted and expert researcher in Dr. Marshall.`

    title: 'Origins of Aspirin',
    introduction: 'The history of aspirin from ancient willow bark to modern medicine',
    passage_text: `When a plant is attacked by bacteria, fungi, or insects, it produces chemicals, called salicylates, that help the plant produce enzymes or toxins capable of destroying the plant's attackers. Salicylates may also play a role in the plant's ability to regulate its temperature, helping the plant tolerate heat and cold. Humans have used the salicylic acids found in plants, particularly in the bark of the willow tree, to fight disease and to reduce fevers.

The first known references to willow bark's medicinal use date from ancient Egypt and Sumeria. On a Sumerian stone tablet from 3000 BCE, willow is listed among dozens of plants used to treat illnesses. An Egyptian papyrus from about 1534 BCE refers to willow's use as an all-purpose medicine.

Though willow trees are often found near water and have become religious symbols in many cultures, its medicinal use gradually fell out of favor in Europe. The high cost of importing cinchona bark from South America, however, was expensive. Consequently, in the mid-1700s, English minister Edward Stone began to seek a substitute. He noted that the bitter taste of willow bark was reminiscent of the bitter taste of cinchona bark.

Known also for his interest in astronomy, Stone pulverized some willow bark and added its powder to a liquid. He administered the medicine to people suffering from fevers and then noted that it worked.

As the field of medicine evolved, so did the use of willow bark. Searching for a way to make the salicylic acid in willow bark less abrasive to the stomach, in 1853 French chemist Charles von Gerhardt created a synthetic version. Decades later, German chemist Felix Hoffmann combined synthetic salicylic acid with acetic acid, inventing a consumer-friendly powdered formula that would come to be known as aspirin.`
