const PASSAGE_TEXT = `The whitefly Bemisia argentifolii is an insect that has 3 distinct life stages: egg, nymph (juvenile), and adult. A study examined the effects of external temperature on the duration of each of the 3 life stages of B. argentifolii and on egg production by adult female B. argentifolii. Figure 1 shows, for each of 5 external temperatures, the average duration of each life stage. Figure 2 shows, for each of the 5 temperatures, the average number of eggs produced per female per day during the first 7 days of adult life.

[Figure 1: Shows duration in days vs temperature (Â°C) for egg, nymph, and adult stages at 20, 25, 27, 30, and 35Â°C]

[Figure 2: Shows average number of eggs produced per female per day vs temperature (Â°C) at 20, 25, 27, 30, and 35Â°C]
