    title: 'Plant Stem Color Genetics',
    introduction: 'Four students propose explanations for green vs. purple stems in plants',
    passage_text: `Four students observed that in a population of land plants, Population A, a plant could have a green stem or a purple stem. Each student proposed an explanation for this observation.

Student 1
All plants in Population A produce the green pigment chlorophyll. If a plant receives 8 hr or more of sunlight each day, it also produces a purple pigment, causing its stem to be purple. If a plant receives less than 8 hr of sunlight each day, it does not produce this purple pigment, so its stem is green. All plants in Population A are genetically identical, so they all have the ability to produce both pigments.

Student 2
All plants in Population A produce the green pigment chlorophyll. If a plant receives too little phosphorus (a nutrient), it also produces a purple pigment, causing its stem to be purple. If a plant receives enough phosphorus, it does not produce this purple pigment, so its stem is green. All plants in Population A are genetically identical, so they all have the ability to produce both pigments. The amount of sunlight received by a plant does not affect stem color.

Student 3
All plants in Population A produce the green pigment chlorophyll. The production of purple pigment is determined by Gene Q, which has 2 alleles (Q and q) and 3 possible genotypes (QQ, Qq, and qq). A plant with either the Gene Q genotype QQ or the Gene Q genotype Qq produces the purple pigment, causing its stem to be purple. A plant with the Gene Q genotype qq does not produce this purple pigment, so its stem is green. The amount of sunlight or nutrients received by a plant does not affect stem color.

Student 4
All plants in Population A produce the green pigment chlorophyll. The production of purple pigment is determined by Gene Q, which has 2 alleles (Q and q) and 3 possible genotypes (QQ, Qq, and qq). A plant with the Gene Q genotype qq produces the purple pigment, causing its stem to be purple. A plant with either the Gene Q genotype QQ or the Gene Q genotype Qq does not produce this purple pigment, so its stem is green. The amount of sunlight or nutrients received by a plant does not affect stem color.`,

    title: 'Water Electrolysis Using Solar Cells',
    introduction: 'Experiment studying hydrogen production from water using solar energy',
    passage_text: `Liquid H‚ÇÇO can be broken down into hydrogen gas (H‚ÇÇ) and oxygen gas (O‚ÇÇ) by electrolysis according to the following chemical equation:
2H‚ÇÇO ‚Üí 2H‚ÇÇ + O‚ÇÇ

A scientist performed an experiment to study the electrolysis of H‚ÇÇO using electricity generated from sunlight.

Experiment
Steps 1-5 were performed daily for 12 months:

1. A tank fitted with 2 electrodes‚Äîan anode (where O‚ÇÇ would be produced) and a cathode (where H‚ÇÇ would be produced)‚Äîwas assembled. Each electrode was suspended in an inverted plastic tube, and each tube was marked to allow gas volume to be measured.

2. Four liters (4.0 L) of a 25% by mass aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was added to the tank. As a result, the tubes were completely filled with the solution.

3. At 8:00 a.m., a rectangular solar cell was attached to the electrodes and placed next to a particular south-facing window for 8 hr.

4. Eight hours later, the solar cell was detached from the electrodes, and the amount of H‚ÇÇ that had been produced was measured.

5. The tank, tubes, and electrodes were cleaned and dried for reuse.`,

    title: 'Standing Waves on Strings',
    introduction: 'Experiments on harmonics and standing waves using different strings',
    passage_text: `A standing wave on a taut string is a wave that appears to vibrate without traveling along the string. Such waves are called the string's harmonics. Each harmonic has a characteristic number of nodes: locations between the ends of the string that do not move (the ends of the string do not count as nodes).

A string having a mass per unit length of Œº was attached on one end to an oscillator (a motor that vibrates) and on the other end to a pulley and ratchet. The student could select the frequency, f (the number of cycles per second), of the oscillator's vibration. By cranking the ratchet, the student could vary the force of tension, T, in the string.

Experiment 1
With 0.10 newtons (N) of tension in String X (Œº = 0.02 g/cm), the student varied f. She noted that standing waves occurred only at certain values of f. The student sketched the first 5 harmonics and recorded f (in hertz, Hz) for each. She repeated this procedure for String Y (Œº = 0.08 g/cm) and for String Z (Œº = 0.16 g/cm).

Experiment 2
Beginning again with String X, the student set the oscillator to vibrate at f = 25.0 Hz. She then varied T, and noted that standing waves occurred only at certain values of T. The student recorded T for the first 5 harmonics. She repeated this procedure for Strings Y and Z.`,
