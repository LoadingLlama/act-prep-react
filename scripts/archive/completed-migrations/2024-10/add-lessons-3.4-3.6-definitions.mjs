  // Lesson 3.4: Logarithms
  {
    term: 'Logarithms',
    definition: 'The inverse operation of exponentiation. A logarithm answers the question: "To what power must we raise the base to get this number?" For example, log‚ÇÇ(8) = 3 because 2¬≥ = 8.',
    lesson_key: '3.4'
  },
  {
    term: 'logarithm',
    definition: 'The inverse operation of exponentiation. Written as log‚Çê(x) = y, meaning "a raised to what power equals x?" Answer: y. For example, log‚ÇÇ(8) = 3 because 2¬≥ = 8.',
    lesson_key: '3.4'
  },
  {
    term: 'inverse operation',
    definition: 'An operation that reverses the effect of another operation. For example, subtraction is the inverse of addition, division is the inverse of multiplication, and logarithms are the inverse of exponentiation.',
    lesson_key: '3.4'
  },
  {
    term: 'base',
    definition: 'In logarithms (log‚Çê(x)), the base is "a" - the number being raised to a power. In exponents (a‚Åø), the base is "a" - the number being multiplied by itself. Common bases: 10 (common log), e (natural log), 2 (binary).',
    lesson_key: '3.4'
  },
  {
    term: 'argument',
    definition: 'In logarithms log‚Çê(x), the argument is "x" - the number you\'re taking the logarithm of. The argument must always be positive (x > 0) because you can\'t raise a positive base to any power and get a negative or zero result.',
    lesson_key: '3.4'
  },
  {
    term: 'result',
    definition: 'The output or answer to a mathematical operation. In log‚Çê(x) = y, the result is y. In 2¬≥ = 8, the result is 8.',
    lesson_key: '3.4'
  },
  {
    term: 'exponent',
    definition: 'A notation that indicates how many times to multiply a number (the base) by itself. For example, 3‚Å¥ means 3 √ó 3 √ó 3 √ó 3 = 81. In logarithms, the exponent is what you\'re solving for.',
    lesson_key: '3.4'
  },
  {
    term: 'common logarithm',
    definition: 'A logarithm with base 10, written as log(x) or log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(x). For example, log(100) = 2 because 10¬≤ = 100. Common logs are useful for scientific notation and orders of magnitude.',
    lesson_key: '3.4'
  },
  {
    term: 'e',
    definition: 'Euler\'s number, approximately 2.71828... A fundamental mathematical constant that appears in exponential growth, compound interest, and calculus. The base of the natural logarithm.',
    lesson_key: '3.4'
  },
  {
    term: 'natural logarithm',
    definition: 'A logarithm with base e (Euler\'s number ‚âà 2.718), written as ln(x) or log‚Çë(x). For example, ln(e¬≤) = 2. Natural logs appear frequently in exponential growth/decay, compound interest, and higher mathematics.',
    lesson_key: '3.4'
  },
  {
    term: 'change of base formula',
    definition: 'A formula to convert logarithms between different bases: log‚Çê(x) = log(x)/log(a) or ln(x)/ln(a). Useful when your calculator only has log and ln buttons but you need a different base.',
    lesson_key: '3.4'
  },

  // Lesson 3.5: Inequalities
  {
    term: 'Inequalities',
    definition: 'Mathematical statements that compare two expressions using symbols: < (less than), > (greater than), ‚â§ (less than or equal to), ‚â• (greater than or equal to). Unlike equations, inequalities have a range of solutions.',
    lesson_key: '3.5'
  },
  {
    term: 'inequality',
    definition: 'A mathematical statement comparing two expressions with <, >, ‚â§, or ‚â•. For example, x > 5 means "x is greater than 5." Solutions include all values that make the inequality true.',
    lesson_key: '3.5'
  },
  {
    term: 'range of solutions',
    definition: 'The set of all values that satisfy an inequality. For example, x > 3 has solutions {3.1, 4, 5, 100, ...}. Often represented on a number line or in interval notation.',
    lesson_key: '3.5'
  },
  {
    term: 'Compound inequalities',
    definition: 'Two or more inequalities combined with "and" or "or." Example: 2 < x < 5 means "x is greater than 2 AND less than 5." Example: x < 1 OR x > 3 means x is in one range or the other.',
    lesson_key: '3.5'
  },
  {
    term: 'system of inequalities',
    definition: 'Two or more inequalities that must all be satisfied simultaneously. Graphically represented as the overlapping shaded region where all inequalities are true. Common in linear programming and optimization.',
    lesson_key: '3.5'
  },
  {
    term: 'overlapping region',
    definition: 'In systems of inequalities, the area on a graph where all inequalities are satisfied simultaneously. This region represents all coordinate pairs (x, y) that make every inequality in the system true.',
    lesson_key: '3.5'
  },

  // Lesson 3.6: Absolute Value
  {
    term: 'Absolute value',
    definition: 'The distance of a number from zero on the number line, always positive or zero. Written as |x|. For example, |5| = 5 and |-5| = 5 because both are 5 units from zero.',
    lesson_key: '3.6'
  },
  {
    term: 'absolute value',
    definition: 'The distance of a number from zero, always non-negative. Denoted |x|. Examples: |3| = 3, |-7| = 7, |0| = 0. Geometrically represents distance, which cannot be negative.',
    lesson_key: '3.6'
  },
  {
    term: 'distance from zero',
    definition: 'How far a number is from 0 on the number line. Always measured as a positive value (or zero). This is exactly what absolute value represents: |x| = distance from x to 0.',
    lesson_key: '3.6'
  },
  {
    term: 'V-shaped graph',
    definition: 'The characteristic shape of an absolute value function y = |x|. The graph forms a "V" with the vertex at the origin (0,0), opening upward. The left side has slope -1, the right side has slope +1.',
    lesson_key: '3.6'
