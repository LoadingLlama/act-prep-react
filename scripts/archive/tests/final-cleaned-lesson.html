<p>Every shape has specific formulas for area and perimeter. In this lesson, we'll learn the formulas for all the common shapes you'll see on the ACT. Don't worry about memorizing them all at once—we'll break them down one by one with clear visuals!</p>

  <h3>Understanding Area vs. Perimeter</h3>

      <h4> Perimeter</h4>
      <p>The <strong>distance around</strong> the outside of a shape. Add up all the side lengths!</p>
      <p>Think: walking around the edge of a fence</p>

      <h4> Area</h4>
      <p>The <strong>space inside</strong> a shape. How much surface it covers.</p>
      <p>Think: painting inside the fence</p>

  <h3>Rectangles and Squares</h3>

        <h4>Rectangle</h4>

          <p><strong>Perimeter:</strong> P = 2l + 2w</p>
          <p><strong>Area:</strong> A = l × w</p>

        <h4>Square (special rectangle)</h4>

          <p><strong>Perimeter:</strong> P = 4s</p>
          <p><strong>Area:</strong> A = s²</p>

  <h3>Triangles</h3>

      <p><strong>Area:</strong> A = ½ × base × height</p>
      <p>The height must be perpendicular (90°) to the base!</p>

  <h3>Circles</h3>

      <p><strong>Circumference (perimeter):</strong> C = 2πr</p>
      <p><strong>Area:</strong> A = πr²</p>
      <p> <strong>Remember:</strong> r is the radius (center to edge), and π ≈ 3.14</p>

  <h3>Trapezoids</h3>

      <p><strong>Area:</strong> A = ½ × h × (b₁ + b₂)</p>
      <p>Average the two bases, then multiply by height!</p>

  <h3>Example Problem</h3>

  <h4>Example 1</h4>

  <p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
  <p>A rectangle has length 12 cm and width 5 cm. What is its area?</p>
  <p>A. 17 cm²<br>B. 34 cm²<br>C. 60 cm²<br>D. 120 cm²</p>

  <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
  <p>Use the rectangle area formula: A = l × w</p>

    A = l × w
    A = 12 × 5
    A = 60 cm²

  <p>Answer: C</p>

    <p> Key Takeaway</p>
    <p>Write down the formula first, then plug in the values. For area, you're always multiplying dimensions. For perimeter, you're adding them up!</p>
