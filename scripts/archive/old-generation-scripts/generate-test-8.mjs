        title: "The Legacy of Katherine Johnson",
        passage_text: "Katherine Johnson's calculations helped send astronauts to the moon, yet for decades her contributions remained largely unknown outside NASA. Born in 1918 in West Virginia, Johnson displayed exceptional mathematical ability from an early age. She graduated from high school at fourteen and college at eighteen, earning degrees in mathematics and French.\n\nIn 1953, Johnson joined the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, which later became NASA. As an African American woman in the 1950s and 1960s, she faced significant barriers in a field dominated by white men. Despite these obstacles, her computational skills proved indispensable. Before computers became commonplace, human \"computers\"—mostly women—performed complex calculations by hand. Johnson excelled at this work, calculating trajectories for Project Mercury and the Apollo missions.\n\nHer most famous contribution came in 1962 when astronaut John Glenn prepared to orbit Earth. Glenn refused to fly until Johnson personally verified the electronic computer's calculations. \"If she says they're good, then I'm ready to go,\" he declared. Her verification gave Glenn the confidence to complete his historic mission.\n\nIn 2015, President Obama awarded Johnson the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The 2016 film Hidden Figures brought her story to millions, inspiring a new generation of students to pursue careers in science and mathematics. Johnson passed away in 2020 at age 101, having witnessed the impact of her groundbreaking work.",

        title: "Revitalizing Main Street",
        passage_text: "Small-town Main Streets across America have struggled for decades as shopping malls and online retailers drew customers away from traditional downtown districts. Empty storefronts and fading facades became symbols of economic decline. However, a growing movement seeks to reverse this trend through creative revitalization strategies.\n\nRockville, a town of eight thousand residents in rural Iowa, exemplifies this transformation. Five years ago, downtown Rockville consisted primarily of vacant buildings and a few struggling businesses. The town council partnered with a nonprofit organization specializing in downtown revitalization. Together, they developed a comprehensive plan addressing both economic and aesthetic concerns.\n\nThe strategy focused on three key elements: attracting new businesses, improving infrastructure, and creating community gathering spaces. The town offered tax incentives to entrepreneurs willing to open shops downtown. They upgraded sidewalks, installed period lighting, and planted trees. Most significantly, they converted an abandoned warehouse into a community center hosting farmers markets, concerts, and festivals.\n\nThe results exceeded expectations. Within three years, occupancy rates increased from thirty percent to eighty-five percent. New restaurants, boutiques, and art galleries opened their doors. Property values rose, generating additional tax revenue for continued improvements. Residents reported increased pride in their community and greater civic engagement.\n\nWhile challenges remain—including competition from e-commerce and the need for ongoing investment—Rockville's experience demonstrates that thoughtful planning and community commitment can breathe new life into struggling downtown districts.",

        title: "The Art of Botanical Illustration",
        passage_text: "Botanical illustration occupies a unique position between art and science, requiring both aesthetic sensibility and scientific accuracy. For centuries, these detailed drawings have served as essential tools for botanists, enabling them to document and classify plant species with precision that photography cannot always achieve.\n\nThe golden age of botanical illustration occurred during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when European explorers brought back thousands of plant specimens from distant lands. Artists worked closely with scientists, learning to depict not just the beauty of plants but their essential characteristics: the arrangement of leaves, the structure of flowers, the details of seeds and fruit. These illustrations became permanent records, especially important when specimens themselves degraded over time.\n\nToday, despite advances in photography and digital imaging, botanical illustration remains relevant. Photographs can capture a moment, but illustrations can show multiple stages of growth, cross-sections of stems, and details too small for standard photography. Moreover, an artist can emphasize diagnostic features that distinguish one species from another, creating images more useful for identification than even the best photographs.\n\nSarah Chen, a contemporary botanical illustrator, explains her process. She begins by studying live specimens, making careful observations and measurements. Then she creates preliminary sketches, refining proportions and arrangements. The final illustration, often rendered in watercolor, might require forty hours of meticulous work. Each tiny hair on a stem, each vein in a leaf must be accurately depicted.\n\nMuseums and botanical gardens continue to commission these illustrations, recognizing their enduring scientific and artistic value. As Chen notes, \"A good botanical illustration tells the truth about a plant in ways that transcend mere visual representation.\"",

        passage_number: 5,
        title: "Adapting to Climate Change: Coastal Communities",
        passage_text: "Rising sea levels pose unprecedented challenges for coastal communities worldwide. As ocean waters encroach on shorelines, towns and cities must decide whether to defend against the water, accommodate it, or retreat to higher ground. Each option carries significant economic, social, and environmental implications.\n\nMiami Beach, Florida, has chosen the defense strategy, investing hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure improvements. The city installed massive pumps to remove floodwater from streets, raised roads by several feet, and implemented sophisticated drainage systems. While expensive, these measures aim to protect property values and maintain the city's economic viability. Critics, however, question whether such investments merely delay inevitable relocation.\n\nBy contrast, the village of Newtok, Alaska, has opted for retreat. Thawing permafrost and coastal erosion have made their current location uninhabitable. After years of planning, the community began relocating to a new site nine miles inland. The process has proven emotionally difficult and financially challenging, requiring coordination among multiple government agencies and nonprofit organizations. Yet residents view it as the only viable long-term solution.\n\nA third approach, accommodation, accepts that water will increasingly intrude into urban spaces and designs accordingly. Rotterdam in the Netherlands has pioneered this strategy, creating floating parks, water plazas that serve as recreational spaces during dry weather and retention basins during storms, and amphibious houses that rise with flood waters. This approach works with nature rather than against it.\n\nExperts emphasize that no single strategy suits all communities. Each must weigh factors including topography, resources, and community values when charting their path forward in an era of climate uncertainty.",
