Understanding the test format and developing effective strategies are crucial for success.</p>\n\n      <h3>Test Structure</h3>\n      <p>The ACT consists of four main sections:</p>\n      <ul>\n          <li><strong>English (45 minutes, 75 questions):</strong> Tests grammar, usage, punctuation, and rhetorical skills</li>\n          <li><strong>Mathematics (60 minutes, 60 questions):</strong> Covers algebra, geometry, and trigonometry</li>\n          <li><strong>Reading (35 minutes, 40 questions):</strong> Tests reading comprehension across various subjects</li>\n          <li><strong>Science (35 minutes, 40 questions):</strong> Evaluates interpretation and analysis of scientific data</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h3>Scoring</h3>\n      <p>Each section is scored from 1-36, and your composite score is the average of all four sections. Most colleges consider a score of 20+ competitive, while top universities typically look for scores of 30+.</p>\n\n      <h3>Study Strategy</h3>\n      <p>Effective ACT preparation involves:</p>\n      <ul>\n          <li>Taking a diagnostic test to identify strengths and weaknesses</li>\n          <li>Focusing study time on areas that need the most improvement</li>\n          <li>Learning test-specific strategies and time management techniques</li>\n          <li>Taking multiple practice tests to build stamina and familiarity</li>\n          <li>Reviewing mistakes and understanding why correct answers are right</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>Remember: consistent, focused practice is more effective than cramming. Start with your weakest areas and gradually build confidence across all sections.</p>\n    ",

Strategy: Your ACT Subject-Verb Decision Process</h3>\n    <div class=\"concept-box\">\n        <h4>🎯 When You See Subject-Verb Agreement on the ACT:</h4>\n\n        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Find the verb (the action or state of being word)</p>\n        <p>→ Look for words like is/are, has/have, was/were, or action words</p>\n\n        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Find the subject (who or what does the verb?)</p>\n        <p>→ Cross out prepositional phrases and interrupting information</p>\n        <p>→ The subject is never inside a prepositional phrase!</p>\n\n        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Determine if subject is singular or plural</p>\n        <p>→ Use your indefinite pronoun memory list</p>\n        <p>→ Remember: compound subjects with \"and\" = plural</p>\n        <p>→ Remember: compound subjects with \"or/nor\" = closest subject wins</p>\n\n        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Match verb form to subject</p>\n        <p>→ Singular subject = verb ends in 's' (in present tense)</p>\n        <p>→ Plural subject = verb has no 's' ending</p>\n\n        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Check verb tense consistency</p>\n        <p>→ All verbs should generally be in same tense</p>\n        <p>→ Use context clues for time relationships</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n    <h3>Chapter 4 Success Summary</h3>\n    <div class=\"concept-box\">\n

A calculator is allowed in this section, and you should use your calculator a lot! Even for simple mental math, use the calculator. This will help keep your mind fresh and avoid simple mistakes.</p>\n\n      <h3>Difficulty of the Questions</h3>\n      <p>As you progress through the test, the difficulty of the questions increases. The first 5-10 questions in general will be much easier. As you move towards the later questions, the difficulty will increase slightly until around question 30, where the questions will quickly get much more difficult.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"rules-box\">\n        <h4>Question Difficulty Breakdown:</h4>\n        <table>\n          <tr><th>Difficulty</th><th>Question Number</th></tr>\n          <tr><td>Very Easy</td><td>1 – 5</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Easy</td><td>6 – 15</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Medium</td><td>16– 30</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Hard</td><td>31 – 45</td></tr>\n        </table>\n      </div>\n\n      <h3>Time Management</h3>\n      <p>On average, you have just over 1 minute (1 minute and 6 seconds to be exact) to answer each question. Some questions can be solved very quickly while others can take much longer to solve. In general, you should be solving the earlier questions in less than 60 seconds, as the later, more difficult questions will require more time.</p>\n\n      <p>If you get to a question that you do not know how to solve, circle the number, bubble in an answer, and move on. You can always come back to the questions that you circled at the end if you have time left.</p>\n\n      <h3>Guessing</h3>\n      <p>There is no penalty for guessing. Make sure that you bubble in an answer for every single question. On a multiple-choice test, there is no best method for guessing, so look at the answer choices and pick the answer that looks best to you.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"key-takeaway\">\n        <h4>6 Test Day Tips to Maximize Your Score</h4>\n        <ol>\n          <li><strong>Keep Moving:</strong> Do not get stuck on any one question for too long</li>\n          <li><strong>Look For Questions You Know How To Solve:</strong> If time is running out, find questions you can solve quickly</li>\n          <li><strong>Do Your Best To See All 45 questions:</strong> Don't get stuck on one hard question and miss easier ones later</li>\n          <li><strong>Memorize The Equations:</strong> Having formulas memorized saves time</li>\n          <li><strong>Use The Calculator!</strong> Use your calculator as much as possible</li>\n          <li><strong>Practice Like Its Test Day:</strong> Set a timer and strictly follow it during practice</li>\n        </ol>\n      </div>\n    ",

    "content": "\n      <p class=\"lesson-intro\">In the first two chapters, you will learn two important test-taking techniques: backsolving and substitution. As you work through the rest of the book, use these techniques whenever you can to solve questions.</p>\n\n      <p>Backsolving is plugging the answer choices back into the question. On the ACT, you are given 4 answer choices for multiple choice questions, and one of those 4 choices must be correct. Rather than solving the question algebraically and determining whether your answer matches one of the answer choices, you can guess-and-check with the answer choices to find which one is correct.</p>\n\n      <h3>Backsolving can be done using five steps:</h3>\n      <div class=\"rules-box\">\n        <ol>\n          <li><strong>Start with B or C.</strong> Plug the value in the answer choice back into the question.

To make this question easier, let's plug in numbers. We can say that Jeremy has 2 boxes of candy, so n = 2, and that each box contains 5 bars of candy, so m = 5. With our numbers, Jeremy has a total of 10 candy bars. He needs to sell 70% to make enough money for rent, so we can find the total candy bars that he must sell by finding 70% of 10.</p>\n        <p>0.7(10) = 7</p>\n        <p>With our numbers, Jeremy must sell 7 candy bars, so our answer is 7.

Master both substitution and elimination methods, choose the easier method for each problem, and always check your solutions. Remember: substitution works great when one variable is isolated, elimination works well with similar coefficients. Practice identifying the three types of solutions: one solution (intersecting lines), no solution (parallel lines), and infinite solutions (same line)!</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"interactive-quiz\">\n    <h3>🎯 Interactive Quiz: Master Systems of Equations!</h3>\n    <div class=\"quiz-intro\">\n        <p>Time to apply your skills!

Master the difference between arithmetic (constant difference) and geometric (constant ratio) sequences, memorize the key formulas, and practice identifying sequence types quickly. Remember: always check if differences are constant first, then ratios, then look for special patterns like squares or cubes. For infinite geometric series, convergence only occurs when |r| < 1. These concepts appear frequently in ACT word problems and pattern recognition questions!</p>\n</div>\n\n<!-- QUIZ_22 -->\n    ",

Master the multiplication principle for basic counting, distinguish between permutations (order matters) and combinations (order doesn't matter), and understand basic probability rules. Remember: use permutations for arrangements and positions, combinations for selections and groups, and always check if events are independent when multiplying probabilities. These concepts appear in both math and science sections of the ACT!</p>\n</div>\n\n<!-- QUIZ_23 -->\n    ",

Master the basic definition (log_b(x) = y means b^y = x), memorize the three key properties (product, quotient, and power rules), and practice converting between logarithmic and exponential forms. Remember: logarithms turn multiplication into addition, division into subtraction, and powers into multiplication. These concepts appear in advanced ACT problems involving exponential growth, pH calculations, and earthquake measurements!</p>\n</div>\n\n<!-- QUIZ_24 -->\n    ",

Master the standard forms of circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas, and practice converting between general and standard forms. Remember: circles have equal coefficients for x² and y², ellipses have different positive coefficients, parabolas have only one squared term, and hyperbolas have opposite signs. These advanced topics test your ability to work with complex algebraic expressions and geometric relationships!</p>\n</div>\n\n<!-- QUIZ_25 -->\n    ",

Master the powers of i (repeating pattern: i, -1, -i, 1), practice operations with complex numbers, and understand conjugates for division. Remember: i² = -1 always, complex conjugates multiply to give real numbers, and the absolute value uses the Pythagorean theorem. Complex numbers appear in advanced ACT problems and connect algebra with geometry through the complex plane!</p>\n</div>\n\n<!-- QUIZ_26 -->\n    ",
