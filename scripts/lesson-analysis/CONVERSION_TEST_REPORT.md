## Example Conversions

### Example 1: Em Dash Separation (Reading)

**BEFORE:**
```
When you're uncertain between two answer choices, the best strategy
is to return to the passage and identify precisely where the relevant
information appears. Read that section carefully—often within a window
of 3-5 lines around the line reference—and compare the passage's exact
wording to each answer choice. The correct answer will closely align
with the passage's language and meaning, while wrong answers will
introduce subtle distortions, exaggerations, or contradictions.
```

**AFTER:**

```

### Example 2: Multiple Strong Points (Science)

**BEFORE:**
```
After the introduction, go directly to the figures and tables—this is
where most of the important information lives. For each figure, identify:
(1) what variables are being shown (read axis labels and column headers
carefully), (2) what units are used (meters, grams, seconds, degrees
Celsius, etc.), (3) what general trends are visible (do values increase,
decrease, stay constant, or show a pattern?), and (4) what different
lines, symbols, or categories represent (check the legend or key).
```

**AFTER:**

• what different lines, symbols, or categories: represent (check the legend or key)
```

### Example 3: List Keywords (Reading)

**BEFORE:**
```
The ACT uses predictable types of wrong answers across all Reading
questions. Learning to recognize these patterns accelerates your
elimination process. The six most common wrong answer types are: Too
Extreme (uses absolute language like "always," "never," "impossible,"
or "only" when the passage is more nuanced), Distortion (takes
information from the passage but twists or exaggerates it), Out of
Scope (discusses topics not mentioned in the passage or brings in
outside information), Opposite (states the reverse of what the passage
says), Partially Correct (contains some accurate information but
includes a critical error), and Wrong Section (accurately describes
information from the passage but from a different paragraph than what
the question asks about).
```

## What I Recommend

### Option A: Apply to All Reading & Science Lessons Now
If you approve of the conversion quality shown above, I can immediately run the script on:
- All 14 Reading lessons
- All 17 Science lessons
- Total: 31 lessons

**Time**: ~5-10 minutes to convert all

### Option B: Test a Few More Lessons First
I can test 2-3 more Reading/Science lessons for you to review before applying to all.

### Option C: Adjust Detection Sensitivity
If you think:
- **Too aggressive**: I can make it more conservative (convert fewer paragraphs)
- **Not aggressive enough**: I can make it more aggressive (convert more paragraphs)

---

## Detection Patterns Used

The script currently detects and converts paragraphs with:

1. ✅ **Numbered items** - (1), (2), (3) format
2. ✅ **List keywords** - "include:", "are:", "types are:", etc.
3. ✅ **Sequential words** - "First," "Second," "Then," "Next"
4. ✅ **Multiple semicolons** - 3+ semicolons separating points
5. ✅ **Long paragraphs** - 150+ words with 4+ sentences
6. ✅ **Multiple strong points** - 3+ bold items in one paragraph
7. ✅ **Em dash separation** - Using — to separate concepts

### What It Skips:

- Short paragraphs (<100 words)
- Intro paragraphs (1-2 sentences)
- Key Takeaways sections
- Example/Solution blocks
- Answer choice blocks

## Next Steps - Your Decision

**Please review the BEFORE/AFTER files and let me know:**

1. ✅ **Approve** - Apply to all 31 Reading/Science lessons
2. 🔄 **Test more** - Show me 2-3 more examples first
3. ⚙️ **Adjust** - Make it more/less aggressive
4. ❌ **Reject** - This approach isn't working

**If you approve, I'll create a batch script to apply this to all Reading/Science lessons and provide a final summary report.**
