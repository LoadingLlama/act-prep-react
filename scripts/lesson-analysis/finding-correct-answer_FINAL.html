<html><head></head><body><p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Successfully identifying correct answers on the ACT Reading section requires mastering three essential strategies: prediction before looking at choices, matching technique, and comparison methodology. These complementary approaches help you avoid common traps created by tempting but incorrect answer choices, improve your accuracy even under time pressure, and develop the critical thinking skills needed to distinguish between answers that seem right versus answers that are definitively correct based on textual evidence.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">By systematically applying these three strategies, you can transform your approach from guesswork into a disciplined, reliable process that consistently yields correct answers.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">1. Strategy 1: Predict the Answer Before Looking at Choices</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">The most powerful strategy for finding correct answers is to <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">predict your own answer</strong> before reading the multiple-choice options. This technique prevents you from being swayed by attractive but incorrect answer choices and trains your brain to focus on what the passage actually says rather than what sounds plausible.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 400;">Why Prediction Works</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">When you read answer choices before formulating your own answer, you become vulnerable to confirmation bias—the tendency to accept information that sounds reasonable without rigorously verifying it against the passage. The ACT exploits this by creating wrong answers that incorporate familiar vocabulary from the passage, sound educated and sophisticated, or align with common misconceptions.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">By predicting first, you anchor yourself to the passage's actual content before being exposed to these misleading options. Even if your prediction doesn't match any answer choice exactly, the mental process of forming an answer based on the passage strengthens your comprehension and makes it easier to spot which answer choice best aligns with your understanding.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Think of prediction as building a mental filter that helps you evaluate answer choices more objectively.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 400;">How to Implement the Prediction Strategy</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Read the question carefully</strong>: identifying exactly what it's asking.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Locate the relevant section</strong>: of the passage (using line references, paragraph references, or your memory of the passage structure).</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Formulate your answer</strong>: in your own words based on what the passage says—this can be a brief mental summary or a phrase you whisper to yourself.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Look for the answer choice that best matches your prediction, understanding that the exact wording will likely differ but the core meaning should align.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">This process takes only 5-10 extra seconds per question but dramatically improves accuracy, especially on questions where multiple answers seem plausible.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 400;">When Prediction Is Most Effective</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Detail questions</strong>: ("According to the passage...")</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Cause-effect questions</strong>: ("The author suggests that X resulted in...")</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Vocabulary-in-context questions</strong>: ("As used in line 42, the word 'revolutionary' most nearly means...")</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">For these question types, the passage typically provides explicit information that allows you to formulate a clear prediction. Prediction is somewhat less useful for broad questions like "What is the main idea of the passage?" or complex inference questions where you need to synthesize multiple pieces of information—for these, you might develop a general sense of the answer rather than a specific prediction.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">However, even for difficult inference questions, taking a moment to think "What does the passage suggest about this topic?" before looking at choices helps orient your thinking.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 400;">Dealing with Imperfect Matches</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Sometimes none of the answer choices will match your prediction exactly. This doesn't mean your prediction was wrong—the ACT deliberately paraphrases passage content rather than quoting it verbatim.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">When this happens, look for the answer choice that comes closest in meaning to your prediction, even if the wording is completely different. Focus on conceptual alignment rather than word-for-word matching.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">If multiple choices seem to match your prediction, you may need to return to the passage for a more nuanced understanding, or you might need to use process of elimination to distinguish between close answers. Occasionally, if no answer remotely matches your prediction, it's worth double-checking that you understood the question correctly and located the right section of the passage.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">A mismatch between your prediction and all answer choices often signals that you've misinterpreted either the question or the passage.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 400;">Example: Prediction in Action</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Question: "The passage indicates that the primary reason for the artist's move to Paris was to..."</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><strong>Without prediction:</strong> You read the choices and think, "Hmm, all of these sound reasonable. Paris was a cultural center, so maybe that's why?"</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><strong>With prediction:</strong> You locate the relevant section: "Seeking formal training unavailable in his rural hometown, he relocated to Paris in 1890." You predict: "to get better art education." Then you scan the choices and find "receive professional instruction in painting techniques," which matches your prediction.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Prediction keeps you grounded in the passage's actual content rather than what seems likely.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">2. Strategy 2: Use the Matching Technique for Direct Questions</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">matching technique</strong> is particularly effective for questions that ask about specific details, explicit statements, or clearly identifiable information. This strategy involves systematically comparing each answer choice to the relevant passage section to find the choice that most accurately reflects the text.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 400;">Understanding the Matching Process</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">The ACT rarely quotes passages verbatim in correct answers. Instead, correct answers paraphrase, summarize, or restate passage content using different vocabulary. This is intentional: the test wants to verify that you understand the concept, not just recognize familiar words.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">When using the matching technique, read each answer choice carefully, then ask yourself: "Does this answer say essentially the same thing as the passage, just in different words?" Pay attention to semantic equivalence—different words conveying the same meaning.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">For example, if the passage says "extremely difficult," an answer choice might say "very challenging" or "highly demanding."</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 400;">Identifying Key Elements to Match</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">When comparing answer choices to the passage, verify these key elements:</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Subject/actor</strong>: (who is performing the action or who the sentence is about)</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Action/verb</strong>: (what is happening or being done)</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Object/recipient</strong>: (what is being affected or acted upon)</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Cause and effect</strong>: (what led to what)</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Timing</strong>: (when something occurred or the sequence of events)</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Degree/intensity</strong>: (how much, to what extent, or the strength of something)</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Wrong answers often change one of these elements subtly. For instance, they might swap the subject and object (reversing who did what to whom), shift the timing (claiming something happened before when it actually happened after), or alter the degree (changing "some improvement" to "dramatic transformation").</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 400;">Line-by-Line Verification</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">For questions with line references (e.g., "In lines 34-38, the author suggests..."), the matching technique becomes especially powerful. Locate the exact lines referenced, then read them carefully along with 1-2 sentences before and after for context.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Place your finger or pencil on the relevant section so you can easily refer back. Now read each answer choice and compare it directly to these lines.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Ask: "Does this choice accurately represent what these lines say?" Cross out any choice that introduces information not in those lines, contradicts the lines, or distorts their meaning. The correct answer should feel like a faithful translation of the passage's content into different words.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">This verification process might seem time-consuming, but it takes only 10-15 seconds and dramatically reduces errors on detail questions.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 400;">Recognizing Paraphrasing Patterns</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">The ACT uses predictable paraphrasing patterns in correct answers. Common patterns include synonym substitution (replacing words with synonyms: "rapid" becomes "quick," "demonstrate" becomes "show"), grammatical transformation (changing the grammatical structure while preserving meaning: "The experiment was successful" becomes "The success of the experiment"), summarization (condensing multiple sentences into one statement that captures the main point), and generalization (moving from specific examples to broader categories: "roses, tulips, and daisies" becomes "various flowers").</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Training yourself to recognize these paraphrasing patterns helps you identify correct answers even when they look different from the passage text. Practice this skill by reading explanations for correct answers in official practice tests and noting how they paraphrase passage content.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 400;">Example: Matching Technique</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Passage (lines 45-47): "The scientist's innovative methodology revolutionized data collection, enabling researchers to gather information with unprecedented accuracy and speed."</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Question: "According to lines 45-47, the scientist's new method..."</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Correct answer (good match)</strong>: "significantly improved the precision and efficiency of information gathering" (paraphrases "unprecedented accuracy and speed" and "revolutionized data collection")</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Wrong answer (poor match)</strong>: "was the first method ever used to collect data" (distorts "innovative" and "revolutionized" into an extreme claim not supported by the text)</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">3. Strategy 3: Use Comparison to Choose Between Close Answers</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">When you've narrowed choices down to two or three answers that all seem plausible, the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">comparison methodology</strong> helps you identify the best answer by systematically analyzing the subtle differences between remaining choices and determining which one most accurately reflects the passage.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 400;">The Art of Close Comparison</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Close comparison requires examining the specific differences between similar answer choices to determine which is more accurate. Often, two answers will be nearly identical except for one or two key words—and those small differences are crucial.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">When comparing close answers, identify exactly what distinguishes them: Is it a difference in degree ("some" vs. "many" vs. "all")? A difference in tone ("criticized" vs. "questioned" vs. "praised")? A difference in scope ("the first paragraph" vs. "the entire passage")? A difference in timing ("before" vs. "after" vs. "during")?</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Once you've identified the specific difference, return to the passage to determine which version the text actually supports. The passage will favor one choice over the other, even if the difference seems minor. This granular level of analysis is what separates scores in the 30-36 range from scores in the 24-29 range.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 400;">Spotting the "More Complete" Answer</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Sometimes two answer choices are both technically accurate, but one is more complete or more precise than the other. For example, if a passage discusses how an artist's childhood experiences influenced their mature work, one answer might say "The artist's early life affected their later paintings" while another says "The artist's childhood poverty and family struggles shaped their mature work's focus on social inequality." Both are true based on the passage, but the second answer is more specific and complete.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">In these cases, the ACT typically rewards the answer that provides more relevant detail or captures more of what the passage conveys. However, be careful not to confuse "more complete" with "adding information not in the passage"—the more detailed answer must still be fully supported by the text.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 400;">Identifying the Critical Difference</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Between two close answers, there's usually one critical difference—meaning it determines which answer is correct. For instance, consider two answers: "The author believes the policy was somewhat effective" vs. "The author believes the policy was highly effective." The critical difference is "somewhat" vs. "highly"—a difference in degree.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">You must return to the passage to determine which degree of effectiveness the author actually expressed. Did they use words like "moderately," "partially," or "limited" (supporting "somewhat")? Or did they use words like "extremely," "remarkably," or "significant" (supporting "highly")?</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">The passage will provide clues—you must read carefully because sometimes the difference is subtle. Training yourself to identify and verify these critical differences is essential for achieving top scores.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 400;">The "Best Answer" Mindset</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">ACT Reading questions ask for the "best" answer, not necessarily a perfect answer. Sometimes you'll encounter situations where no answer seems ideal, or where you can find minor flaws in all choices.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">When this happens, don't get paralyzed searching for perfection. Instead, ask: "Which answer is most strongly supported by the passage? Which has the fewest problems or smallest discrepancies?" Even if an answer isn't perfectly worded, if it's clearly better than the other three options, it's the correct choice.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">This pragmatic mindset helps you make decisions efficiently rather than agonizing over imperfect options. Trust that if you're choosing between answers based on careful passage verification, you'll arrive at the intended correct answer. The ACT is designed to have one answer that's clearly best, even if it's not flawless.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 400;">Example: Comparison Methodology</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">You've eliminated choices A and B. Comparing the remaining choices:</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Choice C</strong>: "The researcher's findings challenged previous assumptions."</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Choice D</strong>: "The researcher's findings completely disproved previous assumptions."</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Critical difference</strong>: "challenged" vs. "completely disproved"</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Return to passage</strong>: "These results called into question several long-held beliefs, though further research would be needed to definitively resolve the matter."</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Verdict</strong>: Choice C is correct. "Called into question" aligns with "challenged," while the passage's acknowledgment that more research is needed contradicts "completely disproved."</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">4. Combining All Three Strategies for Maximum Effectiveness</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">While each strategy is powerful individually, combining <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">prediction</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">matching</strong>, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">comparison</strong> creates a comprehensive approach that handles any question type efficiently and accurately. Understanding when and how to use each strategy is key to mastering ACT Reading.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 400;">The Integrated Approach</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">For most questions, an integrated approach works best: Start with prediction (formulate your own answer before looking at choices), then use matching (compare answer choices to your prediction and the passage), and finally employ comparison if needed (choose between close answers by identifying critical differences). This three-step process creates a systematic method that prevents rushing and reduces careless errors.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">For straightforward questions where your prediction matches an answer choice clearly, you might complete all three steps in 20-30 seconds. For complex questions requiring careful analysis, the full process might take 45-60 seconds.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">The time investment is worth it because this systematic approach minimizes wrong answers caused by misreading, hasty judgments, or falling for trap answers.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 400;">Adapting Strategies to Question Types</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Detail questions</strong>: ("According to the passage...") work best with prediction followed by matching.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Main idea questions</strong>: ("The primary purpose of the passage is to...") benefit from matching your understanding of the overall passage to the answer choices, with less emphasis on prediction.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Inference questions</strong>: ("The passage suggests that...") often require comparison because multiple answers might seem reasonable.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Vocabulary-in-context questions work well with prediction (substitute your predicted word into the sentence) followed by matching.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">As you practice, you'll develop intuition about which strategy to emphasize for each question type, making your approach faster and more efficient.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 400;">Building Speed Through Practice</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Initially, using these three strategies systematically will feel slow and methodical. This is normal and expected—you're developing new habits that replace rushed, intuitive answering with disciplined analysis.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">However, with consistent practice, these strategies become automatic and actually increase your speed because you make fewer mistakes that require rethinking or double-checking. Start by practicing these strategies untimed on individual passages, focusing on accuracy over speed.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Once you consistently achieve 90%+ accuracy using the strategies, begin timing yourself and gradually work on speed. Track your progress by passage type and question type to identify where these strategies help most.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Most students find that after 4-6 weeks of deliberate practice, the strategies feel natural and their overall pace improves significantly.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 400;">Troubleshooting Common Challenges</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">If prediction feels difficult, slow down and verify you understand what the question asks. If matching feels impossible because all answers seem different from the passage, practice identifying paraphrases by comparing correct answer explanations to passage text in official practice materials.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">If comparison overwhelms you with too many subtle differences, start by identifying just one critical difference between close answers rather than analyzing all differences.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">If these strategies feel too slow, resist the urge to abandon them—instead, practice specific steps individually until each becomes faster. Accuracy is more important than speed—there's no benefit to finishing early if you're missing many questions. Trust the process and be patient with your improvement.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 400;">Example: Integrated Strategy in Action</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Question: "The passage indicates that the scientist's most significant contribution was..."</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><strong>Step 1 - Predict:</strong> Recall the passage emphasized her development of a new vaccine. Predict: "creating a vaccine."</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><strong>Step 2 - Match:</strong> Scan choices. Choice A says "developing an immunization treatment"—this matches your prediction (vaccine = immunization treatment).</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><strong>Step 3 - Verify:</strong> Choices B, C, D discuss other contributions. Return to passage to verify the vaccine was indeed called "most significant." Passage says "Her groundbreaking vaccine represented the pinnacle of her career." Confirmed.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><strong>Answer:</strong> A. Total time: 35 seconds.</p>
