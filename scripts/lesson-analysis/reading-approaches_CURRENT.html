No single strategy works for everyone, and many successful test-takers adapt their approach based on passage type and difficulty</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">This lesson examines each major reading strategy in depth, explains their advantages and disadvantages, provides guidance on choosing the best approach for your individual needs, and offers techniques for customizing your strategy to maximize both accuracy and speed under the intense time pressure of the Reading section.</li></ul> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 1. The Read-Then-Answer Approach </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Read-Then-Answer approach</strong>, also called the "thorough reading method," involves reading the entire passage carefully and actively before attempting any questions. This traditional strategy emphasizes <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">comprehension</strong> and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">retention</strong> over speed, making it ideal for strong readers who can maintain focus and absorb information efficiently. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> How the Read-Then-Answer Method Works </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">With this approach, you dedicate 3-4 minutes to reading the passage from beginning to end with full concentration and strategic annotation before looking at a single question. During this initial reading, you actively engage with the text by underlining key names and terms, bracketing important examples, noting main ideas in margins, and tracking the author's argument or narrative structure.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The goal is to build comprehensive understanding so that when you reach the questions, you can answer many from memory or quickly locate relevant information. After completing the passage, you tackle questions in order, referring back to specific sections only when necessary for verification or detail questions.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Students using this method typically spend 3-4 minutes reading and 4.5-5.5 minutes answering questions.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Advantages of Read-Then-Answer </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">comprehensive understanding of the passage allows you to answer questions more confidently and accurately, particularly main idea, purpose, and inference questions that require holistic comprehension</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">you can answer many questions from memory without constantly flipping back to the passage, which saves time overall</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">this method reduces the risk of misinterpretation because you understand the full context before analyzing specific details</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">for students who find the constant back-and-forth of other methods disorienting, Read-Then-Answer provides a straightforward, linear process</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">this approach works especially well for Prose Fiction passages where understanding character development, narrative flow, and tone requires reading the full story rather than jumping around</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Disadvantages and Challenges </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">even strong readers sometimes experience information overload, where they read carefully but retain little because they tried to absorb every detail</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">for dense or confusing passages, you might spend 4-5 minutes reading and still feel lost, wasting valuable time</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">this method can encourage passive reading if you're not deliberately engaging with the text—your eyes move across words but your brain doesn't process meaning</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Optimizing Read-Then-Answer for Success </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Read actively:</strong> not passively, by constantly asking yourself questions about the content and purpose.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Annotate strategically:</strong> —mark only the most essential information rather than underlining half the passage.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Summarize:</strong> each paragraph's main point in 2-4 words in the margin to create a roadmap.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Monitor your pace:</strong> —if you're spending more than 4 minutes reading, you need to speed up or switch approaches.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Don't get bogged down: in confusing sections; note them and move forward, returning if questions address those areas</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Finally, after reading, take 5 seconds to mentally summarize the main idea and structure before diving into questions.</li></ul> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Example: Read-Then-Answer in Action Minutes 0:00-3:30: Read the entire Prose Fiction passage carefully, underlining character names and key emotions, noting tone shifts, and writing brief margin notes like "MC's childhood," "meets artist," "conflict with father." Minute 3:30: Mental summary: "Story about a young musician torn between family expectations and artistic passion. Narrator is sympathetic to protagonist." Minutes 3:30-8:45: Answer all 10 questions, referring back only for specific line reference questions and to verify uncertain answers</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Many questions answered from memory of passage structure and content. Result: High accuracy due to thorough comprehension, completed within time limit.</p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 2. The Skim-Then-Detail Approach </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Skim-Then-Detail approach</strong> balances speed and comprehension by quickly surveying the passage to grasp its general structure and main ideas, then returning to read specific sections carefully when answering questions. This hybrid method works well for students who struggle to finish all four passages or who find dense text overwhelming when reading thoroughly. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> How Skim-Then-Detail Works </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">This approach involves two phases. In the skim phase (1.5-2 minutes), you quickly read the first paragraph completely (it usually introduces the topic and sets the tone), then read only the first and last sentence of each middle paragraph (these typically contain topic sentences and concluding thoughts), and finally read the last paragraph completely (it often summarizes or concludes)</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">During skimming, note the passage's general topic, structure, and tone without worrying about specific details. In the detail phase (6-7 minutes), you tackle questions in order, returning to relevant sections of the passage to read carefully and find specific information needed for each question.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">This method trusts that questions will guide you to important details.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Advantages of Skim-Then-Detail </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">it's time-efficient—spending only 1.5-2 minutes on initial reading leaves more time for questions</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">it reduces information overload by having you focus on details only when needed rather than trying to absorb everything at once</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">reading with questions in mind provides purpose and direction, which can improve focus for students who struggle with attention during sustained reading</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">this method works particularly well for Social Science and Natural Science passages that have clear topic sentences and organized paragraph structure</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">for students who read slowly but analyze quickly, this approach plays to their strengths by minimizing reading volume while maintaining comprehension quality</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Disadvantages and Challenges </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">this approach requires extensive back-and-forth between questions and passage, which some students find disorienting or time-consuming</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">main idea questions can be difficult because you haven't read enough to grasp the overall purpose</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">for passages without clear topic sentences—particularly Prose Fiction and some Humanities passages with flowing narrative style—skimming first and last sentences may provide insufficient context</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">students who skim too quickly may miss critical information and end up needing to reread large sections anyway, negating the time savings</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Optimizing Skim-Then-Detail for Success </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">To use this method effectively: Skim actively, not mindlessly—even during the quick skim, engage with what you're reading. Create a mental map noting where different topics are discussed so you can relocate information quickly.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Write brief labels in margins during skimming (e.g., "intro," "problem," "solution," "example") to create landmarks. When reading for questions, read broadly around the relevant section—don't just read one sentence in isolation</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Save main idea questions for last, after you've read most of the passage through answering detail questions. Finally, adapt this strategy by passage type—skim less for fiction, more for organized expository passages.</p> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Example: Skim-Then-Detail in Action Minutes 0:00-1:45: Read first paragraph completely (introduces climate change research). Read first/last sentences of middle paragraphs (note structure: background, methodology, findings, implications).</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Read last paragraph completely (conclusions about policy). Mental note: "Science passage about climate study, organized by research process." Minutes 1:45-8:30: Answer questions in order</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Q1 asks about main purpose—based on skim, answer "to present research findings." Q2 asks detail from paragraph 3—return and read that full paragraph carefully to answer. Continue this pattern</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Result: Time-efficient, sufficient comprehension for most questions.</p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 3. The Questions-First Approach </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The Questions-First approach, sometimes called the "targeted reading method," involves reading the questions before reading the passage. This strategy provides a roadmap of what to look for, turning passive reading into an active search for specific information.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">While controversial and not suitable for everyone, it can be highly effective for certain students and passage types.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> How Questions-First Works </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">This approach begins by spending 1-1.5 minutes reading all question stems (the questions themselves, not the answer choices) to understand what the questions will ask about. Note key terms, names, or line references that questions mention</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Then read the passage with these questions in mind, knowing what information you're hunting for. As you read and encounter information related to a question, mark it (underline, bracket, or write the question number in the margin).</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Some practitioners answer questions as they read, while others read the entire passage with questions in mind, then answer all questions afterward. The key is that questions shape your reading focus from the start.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Advantages of Questions-First </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">it provides clear purpose for your reading—you know exactly what to look for rather than trying to absorb everything</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">it virtually eliminates the need to reread sections because you marked relevant information as you encountered it</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">for students who struggle with attention and focus, having specific targets makes reading feel more like a scavenger hunt than a tedious task</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">this approach works exceptionally well for detail-heavy passages with many specific questions about particular sections</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">it maximizes efficiency by ensuring you focus mental energy on information that's actually tested rather than details that no question addresses</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Disadvantages and Challenges </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">reading 10 questions before the passage can cause cognitive overload—you might not remember what you're looking for by the time you start reading</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">focusing only on question-related information may cause you to miss context and big-picture understanding needed for main idea and inference questions</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">this method is particularly ineffective for Prose Fiction passages where understanding narrative flow, character development, and tone requires reading the story naturally rather than hunting for specific details</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">some students find the constant mental juggling between remembering questions and reading the passage too distracting</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">you risk misinterpreting details by reading them out of context</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Optimizing Questions-First for Success </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">To use this method effectively: Read question stems only, not answer choices, to avoid information overload. Make brief notes about what each question asks—you won't remember all 10 otherwise.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Still read for overall understanding, not just detail hunting—you need context for harder questions. Use this method selectively—it works better for Social Science and Natural Science than for Prose Fiction or complex Humanities passages.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Mark passage sections with question numbers as you find relevant info. Finally, if you find yourself constantly forgetting what you're looking for, this method probably isn't right for you—switch to Read-Then-Answer or Skim-Then-Detail.</p> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Minutes 0:00-1:15:: Read all 10 question stems. Note: Q1 asks about main purpose, Q2-Q4 ask about specific paragraphs</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Q5 asks about "renewable energy" (write "ren. energy" in margin), Q6 vocabulary question about line 45, etc.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Minutes 1:15-7:30:: Read passage with questions in mind. When encountering "renewable energy" in paragraph 3, underline it and write "Q5" in margin</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">When reaching line 45, circle the vocabulary word and write "Q6." Continue marking as you read.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Minutes 7:30-8:45::</strong> Answer questions using your marked sections. Most answers require minimal searching because you marked relevant info during reading.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Result::</strong> Very efficient for well-organized passages with detail questions.</li></ul> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 4. Choosing and Customizing Your Approach </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The best reading approach is the one that maximizes your personal combination of speed, comprehension, and accuracy. Rather than rigidly adhering to one method, successful test-takers often develop hybrid approaches or switch strategies based on passage characteristics.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">This flexibility, combined with deliberate practice, leads to optimal performance.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Determining Your Best Primary Strategy </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">experiment:</strong> during practice. Take three practice passages of the same type (e.g., three Social Science passages) and complete one with each method under timed conditions. Track both your</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">accuracy:</strong> (number correct out of 10) and</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">time: (how long you took). The method that gives you the best accuracy within the time limit is your primary strategy. Also consider subjective factors: Which method felt most comfortable? Which caused the least stress? Which allowed you to maintain focus best? Your ideal strategy should score well, finish within 8-9 minutes</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">feel manageable. Repeat this experiment with different passage types—you might discover that Read-Then-Answer works best for fiction while Skim-Then-Detail works better for science.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Adapting Strategies by Passage Type </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Prose Fiction passages:</strong> generally work best with Read-Then-Answer because narrative flow, character development, and tone require reading the story naturally from beginning to end.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Social Science passages:</strong> with their clear structure and explicit topic sentences, work well with Skim-Then-Detail or even Questions-First.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Humanities passages:</strong> vary—biographical or historical content may work with any method, while literary criticism might require Read-Then-Answer for full comprehension.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Natural Science passages:</strong> often work well with Skim-Then-Detail because they're typically well-organized with clear explanations. Practice with each passage type to identify your optimal approach for each.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Creating Hybrid Approaches </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">many students develop hybrid strategies that combine elements from multiple approaches. For example, you might: Read the first and last paragraphs thoroughly, skim middle paragraphs, then answer questions with detailed reading as needed (hybrid of Read-Then-Answer and Skim-Then-Detail)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Read question stems first to know what to look for, then read the passage thoroughly before answering questions (hybrid of Questions-First and Read-Then-Answer). Read the passage carefully but glance at questions midway through to refocus your attention (Read-Then-Answer with question preview). The key is experimenting to find what works for you. Don't feel constrained by the "official" methods</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">customize based on your strengths</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Building Consistency Through Practice </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Once you've identified your primary strategy (or strategies by passage type), practice it consistently until it becomes automatic. Switching methods randomly or trying new approaches on test day creates confusion and wastes mental energy.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Your goal is to make your chosen approach so habitual that you don't need to think about the process—you can focus entirely on comprehension and answering questions. However, remain flexibly committed: if a particular passage isn't working with your usual method (maybe it's unusually dense or confusing), don't be afraid to adapt.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">For instance, if you normally skim but encounter a complex fiction passage, slow down and read more carefully. The best test-takers have a default approach but can adjust when needed.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Track your progress over multiple practice tests to ensure your chosen strategy consistently delivers results.</p> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Example: Customized Approach by Passage Type Prose Fiction (Passage 1): Read-Then-Answer—read the entire story carefully with focus on characters and plot. Time: 8:30 total.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Social Science (Passage 2): Skim-Then-Detail—quickly skim structure, then read for questions. Time: 8:00 total.</p>
