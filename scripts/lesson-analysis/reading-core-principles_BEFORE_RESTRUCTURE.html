<html><head></head><body><p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Mastering ACT Reading requires understanding and applying seven essential <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">core principles</strong> that separate high-scoring students from those who struggle with time pressure and accuracy. These fundamental concepts—including <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">evidence-based answering</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">process of elimination</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">active engagement</strong>, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">strategic time allocation</strong>—form the foundation of every successful reading strategy. By internalizing these principles and consistently applying them during practice and on test day, you can dramatically improve both your speed and accuracy, transforming the Reading section from an overwhelming challenge into a manageable and even enjoyable part of the ACT. </p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 1. Principle 1: Every Answer Must Be Supported by the Passage </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The most fundamental principle of ACT Reading is that <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">every correct answer must have direct textual support</strong> in the passage. Unlike questions that test general knowledge or personal opinion, ACT Reading questions are designed to have exactly one objectively correct answer based solely on what the passage states or implies. This principle should govern every answer choice you select. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Why This Principle Matters </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Understanding that answers must be <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">passage-based</strong> rather than <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">knowledge-based</strong> changes how you approach every question. Even if you possess extensive background knowledge about a topic, you must resist the temptation to answer based on what you know to be true in the real world. The ACT only cares about what the passage says. This means that if a Natural Science passage claims something factually incorrect (which is rare but possible), you must answer questions based on the passage's claims, not scientific reality. Similarly, if you strongly disagree with an author's perspective in a Humanities passage, you still must select answers that align with the author's stated viewpoint. This principle levels the playing field—students don't need prior knowledge about Shakespeare, quantum physics, or Renaissance art to succeed. Everything you need is in front of you. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> How to Apply Evidence-Based Reasoning </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">even if it sounds plausible or seems reasonable. When reviewing practice questions, always locate the exact line or lines that make the correct answer right. This habit trains your brain to think in terms of evidence rather than assumptions. For inference questions (those using words like "suggests," "implies," or "it can be reasonably inferred"), you're still looking for textual support, but the answer requires combining multiple pieces of information or reading between the lines. However, even inferences must be strongly supported by the passage</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">wild speculation or far-fetched connections are never correct</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Avoiding Outside Knowledge Traps </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The ACT deliberately creates <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">wrong answer choices</strong> that might seem correct if you rely on outside knowledge or common misconceptions. For example, a passage about Abraham Lincoln might omit certain biographical details you learned in history class. If a question asks what the passage reveals about Lincoln's childhood and one answer choice mentions a famous story not included in the passage, that answer is wrong—even if the story is historically accurate. Always restrict yourself to the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">four corners of the passage</strong>. Think of the passage as creating a self-contained universe where only the information presented exists. Your job is to work entirely within that universe, never importing information from outside it. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> The Gold Standard: Line Reference Verification </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">often within a window of 3-5 lines around the line reference</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">and compare the passage's exact wording to each answer choice. The correct answer will closely align with the passage's language and meaning, while wrong answers will introduce subtle distortions, exaggerations, or contradictions. This verification process takes a few extra seconds but dramatically improves accuracy, especially on difficult questions. Make it a habit: locate, verify, select. Never choose an answer based purely on memory or gut feeling without checking the passage first</li></ul> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> <strong>Example: Evidence-Based Selection</strong><br><br> Question: "The author's primary purpose in discussing the artist's early work is to..."<br><br> <strong>Wrong approach:</strong> "I remember learning that this artist's early work was revolutionary, so I'll choose the answer about innovation."<br><br> <strong>Right approach:</strong> "Let me find where the passage discusses the early work. Lines 23-28 say 'Though initially dismissed by critics, these early pieces laid the groundwork for his later masterworks.' This suggests the purpose is showing how early work influenced later development, not discussing innovation."<br><br> Always verify your answer against the passage's actual words. </p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 2. Principles 2-3: Active Reading and Strategic Annotation </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Success on the ACT Reading section requires <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">active engagement</strong> with the text rather than passive consumption of words. Two complementary principles—active reading and strategic annotation—work together to maximize comprehension and retention while minimizing wasted time. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Principle 2: Read Actively, Not Passively </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Active reading</strong> means constantly engaging your mind with questions and predictions as you read. Ask yourself: "What's the main point of this paragraph?", "Why did the author include this example?", "How does this connect to what I just read?", "What might they ask about this section?" This internal dialogue keeps you focused and helps information stick in your memory. Contrast this with <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">passive reading</strong>, where your eyes move across the words but your mind wanders, resulting in reaching the end of a paragraph with no idea what you just read. Active reading is especially crucial on the ACT because the time pressure and dense content make it easy to zone out. If you catch yourself reading passively, stop immediately, go back a paragraph, and restart with active engagement. It's better to read more slowly with full attention than to race through the passage and remember nothing. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Principle 3: Annotate Strategically </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">putting brackets around important examples that illustrate main ideas</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">marking transitions that signal shifts in topic or perspective (words like "however," "moreover," "in contrast")</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">and writing brief margin notes summarizing each paragraph's main idea in 2-4 words. Some students also find it helpful to mark tone shifts or strong opinions expressed by the author</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> What to Annotate (and What to Ignore) </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Focus your annotation on <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">structural elements</strong> and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">key concepts</strong> rather than specific details. Mark topic sentences (usually the first or second sentence of each paragraph) because they often contain main ideas that questions target. Circle proper nouns (names of people, places, organizations) because many questions will reference these specifically, and circling helps you relocate them quickly. Underline words that signal the author's perspective or tone, such as "unfortunately," "remarkably," "surprisingly," or "problematic." However, avoid underlining full sentences or highlighting every fact—this creates visual clutter and defeats the purpose of annotation. Similarly, don't spend time writing lengthy margin notes; brief labels like "background," "first example," "counterargument," or "author's view" are sufficient. Remember, annotation should enhance efficiency, not slow you down. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Balancing Speed with Comprehension </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Some students worry that active reading and annotation will slow them down too much. In reality, these strategies actually <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">save time overall</strong> by reducing the need to reread sections when answering questions. Students who race through passages passively often find themselves rereading entire paragraphs multiple times because they retained nothing from the first reading. In contrast, students who read actively with strategic annotation can usually answer most questions without extensive rereading because they actually understood and remembered the content. The investment of an extra 30-60 seconds during the initial reading pays dividends by shaving seconds off each question. With practice, active reading becomes automatic and doesn't feel slow at all—your brain learns to process text more efficiently while staying engaged. </p> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> <strong>Example: Strategic Annotation in Action</strong><br><br> Original paragraph: "Marie Curie's groundbreaking research on radioactivity transformed modern physics. Born in Warsaw in 1867, she overcame significant obstacles as a woman in science. Her discovery of polonium and radium earned her two Nobel Prizes, making her the first person to win the award in two different sciences."<br><br> <strong>Effective annotation:</strong><br> - Circle "Marie Curie," "polonium," "radium"<br> - Underline "groundbreaking research" and "two Nobel Prizes"<br> - Margin note: "MC's achievements"<br><br> This minimal marking helps you quickly locate information when questions ask about Curie's discoveries or accomplishments without cluttering the text. </p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 3. Principles 4-5: Process of Elimination and Wrong Answer Recognition </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Two of the most powerful strategies for improving accuracy involve focusing on <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">eliminating wrong answers</strong> rather than immediately identifying the right answer. These complementary principles help you navigate difficult questions where the correct answer isn't immediately obvious. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Principle 4: Use Aggressive Process of Elimination </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Process of elimination (POE)</strong> is often more effective than searching for the correct answer directly. For each answer choice, ask: "What's wrong with this answer? How does it contradict, distort, or go beyond the passage?" Physically cross out wrong answers in your test booklet as you <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Cross out wrong answer choices">eliminate</span> them. Even if you can only <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Cross out wrong answer choices">eliminate</span> one or two choices, you've significantly improved your odds of guessing correctly if you run out of time. Many students find it easier to spot what's wrong with an answer than to confidently identify what's right—this is because wrong answers often contain <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">obvious flaws</strong> once you look for them. Train yourself to be skeptical of every answer choice and actively search for reasons to <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Cross out wrong answer choices">eliminate</span> it. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Principle 5: Recognize Common Wrong Answer Patterns </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The ACT uses predictable types of wrong answers across all Reading questions. Learning to recognize these patterns accelerates your elimination process. The six most common wrong answer types are:</p><ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Too Extreme (uses absolute language like "always," "never," "impossible," or "only" when the passage is more nuanced), Distortion (takes information from the passage but twists or exaggerates it), Out of Scope (discusses topics not mentioned in the passage or brings in outside information), Opposite (states the reverse of what the passage says), Partially Correct (contains some accurate information but includes a critical error), and Wrong Section (accurately describes information from the passage but from a different paragraph than what the question asks about)</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Identifying "Too Extreme" Answers </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> One of the easiest wrong answer patterns to spot is the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"Too Extreme"</strong> answer. ACT passages rarely make absolute claims, so be suspicious of answer choices containing words like "always," "never," "all," "none," "impossible," "guaranteed," "only," "exclusively," or "completely." These extreme words are tempting because they sound strong and definitive, but they're usually wrong. For example, if a passage says "Many scientists believe that climate change will significantly impact coastal ecosystems," an answer choice saying "The passage indicates that climate change will definitely destroy all coastal ecosystems" is too extreme—it changes "many scientists believe" to absolute certainty and "significantly impact" to "definitely destroy all." The correct answer would use more measured language like "may affect" or "is likely to impact." Train yourself to flag extreme language and check whether the passage truly supports such absolute claims. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Spotting Distortions and Partial Truths </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Distortion</strong> answers are particularly tricky because they use vocabulary and concepts from the passage, making them sound right at first glance. However, they subtly change the meaning through word substitutions, reversed cause-effect relationships, or exaggerated claims. Always compare the answer choice's wording to the passage's exact phrasing. Similarly, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">partially correct</strong> answers might accurately describe 80-90% of the concept but include one critical error—perhaps switching a date, misidentifying who performed an action, or incorrectly stating an outcome. These answers trap students who skim too quickly and see familiar terms without checking every detail. Your best defense is careful, word-by-word comparison between answer choices and the relevant passage section. Don't let familiar language fool you into assuming an answer is correct without verification. </p> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> <strong>Example: Wrong Answer Patterns</strong><br><br> Passage states: "Some historians argue that the Industrial Revolution improved living standards for workers, while others contend it created harsh working conditions."<br><br> <strong>Too Extreme:</strong> "All historians agree that the Industrial Revolution always improved workers' lives." (WRONG—says "some argue," not "all agree")<br><br> <strong>Distortion:</strong> "Historians believe the Industrial Revolution only harmed workers." (WRONG—passage mentions both positive and negative views)<br><br> <strong>Correct:</strong> "Historians disagree about whether the Industrial Revolution benefited workers." (RIGHT—accurately captures the debate described) </p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 4. Principles 6-7: Strategic Time Management and Flexibility </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The final two core principles address how to manage the Reading section's intense <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">time pressure</strong> and maintain <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">strategic flexibility</strong> to maximize your score. These principles help you make smart decisions about time allocation and prevent common timing pitfalls. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Principle 6: Allocate Time Strategically, Not Equally </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> While the standard advice is to spend about 8:45 per passage, this equal distribution isn't optimal for most students. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Strategic time allocation</strong> means spending less time on passages you find easy and more time on challenging passages, or tackling passages in an order that plays to your strengths. For example, if you're naturally strong with fiction but struggle with science, consider doing passages in this order: Prose Fiction (7 minutes), Humanities (8 minutes), Social Science (9 minutes), Natural Science (11 minutes). This approach banks time early and allocates extra time where you need it most. Alternatively, some students prefer to do their hardest passage type third rather than last, ensuring they tackle it while still mentally fresh. The key is recognizing that not all passages are equally difficult for you personally and adjusting your time budget accordingly. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Avoiding the Time Trap of Difficult Questions </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> One of the biggest timing mistakes is spending 2-3 minutes on a single difficult question while easier questions go unanswered. Remember: every question is worth <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">one point</strong> regardless of difficulty. If you've spent more than 45-60 seconds on a question without making progress, make your best guess, circle it in your test booklet, and move on. You can always return if time permits. This discipline is hard to maintain because our instinct is to "solve" hard problems, but on a timed test, it's better to collect easy points first and use remaining time for difficult questions. Think of it like picking fruit—gather all the low-hanging fruit before attempting to climb the tree for hard-to-reach pieces. Many students find that when they return to circled questions at the end, they can answer them more quickly because they've now read the entire passage and have better context. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Principle 7: Stay Flexible and Adapt Your Strategy </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">the ability to adapt your approach based on what's working (or not working) during the test. No single reading strategy works perfectly for every passage. Some passages have clearly organized paragraphs with explicit topic sentences, making them easy to skim and navigate. Others have dense, complex prose that requires slower, more careful reading. Your strategy should adapt to each passage's characteristics. If you normally annotate heavily but encounter a straightforward passage with simple structure, you can lighten your annotation. If you typically skim first but encounter a confusing literary passage with shifting perspectives, you might need to read more carefully the first time. Similarly, if you're running behind schedule, don't panic</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">adapt by skimming the next passage more quickly or skipping to easier questions first</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Knowing When to Cut Your Losses </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Part of strategic flexibility is recognizing when a passage isn't working for you and making tough decisions about <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">time investment</strong>. If you're 5 minutes into a passage and still confused about the basic content, you have two choices: power through carefully (but accept you'll have less time for other passages) or switch to a different passage and return to this one if time permits. Neither choice is wrong—it depends on your strengths and remaining time. Some students prefer to attempt every question on each passage even if they're unsure, while others strategically guess on the hardest 2-3 questions per passage to bank time for passages they understand better. The key is making these decisions consciously rather than letting time pressure force your hand. Practice different approaches during your preparation to discover what works best for your personal strengths and weaknesses. </p> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> <strong>Example: Strategic Time Allocation</strong><br><br> <strong>Standard approach:</strong> 8:45 per passage (Prose, Social, Humanities, Natural Science in order)<br><br> <strong>Strength-based approach:</strong><br> - Passage 1 (Strong area—Prose Fiction): 7:30<br> - Passage 3 (Strong area—Humanities): 7:30<br> - Passage 2 (Moderate—Social Science): 9:00<br> - Passage 4 (Challenging—Natural Science): 11:00<br><br> By reordering and reallocating time, you maximize points in areas of strength while still giving adequate time to challenging passages. With practice, this strategic approach becomes natural. </p> <p style="height: 1px; margin: 0; padding: 0;"></p><h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700; visibility: hidden; height: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0; overflow: hidden;">.</h3><h3 style="color: #2e7d32; font-size: 1.4rem; font-weight: 700; margin: 3rem 0 1.5rem 0;"> Key Takeaways </h3> <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Every correct answer must be directly supported by evidence in the passage—never rely on outside knowledge</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Read actively by constantly asking questions and making predictions to maintain engagement and retention</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Annotate strategically by marking key names, dates, transitions, and main ideas without cluttering the text</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Use aggressive process of elimination by actively searching for reasons to <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Cross out wrong answer choices">eliminate</span> each wrong answer</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Recognize common wrong answer patterns: too extreme, distortion, out of scope, opposite, partially correct</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Be suspicious of answer choices using absolute language like "always," "never," "all," or "impossible"</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Allocate time strategically based on your strengths—spend less time on easy passages to bank time for hard ones</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Never spend more than 60 seconds on a single question—guess, circle it, and move on if you're stuck</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Stay flexible by adapting your reading strategy to each passage's characteristics and difficulty level</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Practice these principles consistently during preparation until they become automatic on test day</li> </ul></body></html>
