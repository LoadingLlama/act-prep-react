<html><head></head><body><p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The ACT Reading section tests comprehension through seven distinct question types, each requiring specific strategies and skills: Main Idea questions, Detail questions, Inference questions, Vocabulary-in-Context questions, Function and Purpose questions, Author's Attitude and Tone questions, and Comparison questions. Understanding these question types helps you quickly identify what each question asks, apply appropriate strategies, and avoid common traps specific to each type.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">This lesson provides comprehensive coverage of all seven question types, explaining their characteristics, offering targeted strategies for each, and teaching you how to recognize and efficiently answer every question type you'll encounter on test day.</p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 1. Main Idea and Detail Questions </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Main Idea questions and Detail questions together comprise approximately 55-60% of all Reading questions, making them the most common question types. While both test your understanding of passage content, they differ significantly in scope and approach.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Main Idea Questions: Understanding the Big Picture </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Main Idea questions ask about the overall purpose, primary theme, or central argument of the entire passage or a significant portion. Common question stems include:</p><ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">"The main idea of the passage is...", "The primary purpose of this passage is to...", "Which of the following best describes the passage as a whole?"</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">"The passage can best be described as...", or "The author's main point is that..." To answer these questions, you need holistic comprehension</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">understanding not just individual paragraphs but how they work together to convey an overall message. The correct answer will be broad enough to encompass the entire passage but specific enough to capture its unique focus</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Wrong answers are typically too narrow (focusing on one paragraph's content rather than the whole passage), too broad (so general they could describe any passage on the topic), or distorted (misrepresenting the passage's emphasis or purpose)</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Strategies for Main Idea Questions </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Read the introduction and conclusion carefully:</strong> —passages often state their main idea explicitly in these sections.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Track the topic:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">as you read</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">what subject appears in every paragraph? That's likely central to the main idea</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Identify the author's purpose:</strong> —are they explaining something, arguing for a position, telling a story, or analyzing a phenomenon? The main idea should reflect this purpose.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Eliminate answers:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">that focus on supporting details</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">or tangents rather than the central point. If you're unsure</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">ask yourself: "If I had to explain this passage in one sentence</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">what would I say?" Your answer should align with the correct choice</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Some students find it helpful to answer Main Idea questions last, after detail questions have forced them to reread and reinforce their understanding of the passage's content and structure.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Detail Questions: Finding Specific Information </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Detail questions ask about specific facts, events, statements, or examples explicitly mentioned in the passage. They often include line references or paragraph references to guide you.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Common question stems include:.</p><ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">"According to the passage...", "The passage states that...", "The author indicates that...", "Which of the following is mentioned in the passage?"</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">or "In lines 34-38, the author describes..." Detail questions test whether you can locate and accurately understand specific information</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Unlike Main Idea questions that require big:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">picture thinking</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Detail questions reward careful</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">focused reading of particular sections</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">The correct answer will closely paraphrase what the passage says, while wrong answers often distort the passage's information, confuse similar-sounding details, or bring in plausible but unsupported claims</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Strategies for Detail Questions </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Use line references:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">to locate the relevant section quickly</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">read the referenced lines plus 1-2 sentences before and after for context</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Read carefully:</strong> —detail questions often hinge on small distinctions, so pay attention to exact wording.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Match answer choices:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">to the passage text</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">the correct answer should align closely in meaning even if the wording differs</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Eliminate choices:</strong> that introduce information not mentioned in the passage or that contradict what the passage says.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Watch for distortions: —wrong answers might use vocabulary from the passage but twist its meaning. Never answer detail questions from memory alone</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">always verify against the passage. Even if you think you remember the detail clearly, check it—memory can be unreliable under time pressure.</li></ul> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Example: Main Idea vs.</p><ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">just one paragraph's content) Detail Question: "According to lines 23-25, the scientist's initial experiment..." Correct answer: "produced unexpected results that contradicted previous findings" (accurately paraphrases those lines) Wrong answer: "definitively proved the new theory" (distortion</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">passage says results were "suggestive" not "definitive")</li></ul> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 2. Inference and Vocabulary-in-Context Questions </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Inference questions require you to read between the lines and draw logical conclusions based on what the passage implies, while Vocabulary-in-Context questions test whether you understand how specific words function within the passage's meaning. Together, these make up approximately 25-30% of Reading questions.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Inference Questions: Reading Between the Lines </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Inference questions ask you to draw logical conclusions from information the passage suggests but doesn't explicitly state. Question stems include:</p><ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">"The passage suggests that...", "It can reasonably be inferred that...", "The author implies that...", "Based on the passage</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">one can conclude that...", or "Which of the following statements is most strongly supported by the passage?" These questions test critical thinking</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">your ability to combine multiple pieces of information, recognize implications, and identify what must be true based on what the passage says. However, "inference" doesn't mean "wild speculation." Correct inferences are strongly supported by textual evidence even if not stated outright</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Wrong answers often make logical leaps too far from what the passage actually supports or confuse reasonable possibilities with what the passage actually suggests</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Strategies for Inference Questions </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Locate relevant evidence:</strong> —even though the answer isn't stated directly, it will be based on specific passage sections.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Look for clues:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">in descriptive language</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">comparisons</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">cause-effect relationships</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">or the author's tone</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Stay close to the text:</strong> —the correct inference should require only one small logical step from what's stated, not a huge imaginative leap.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Eliminate extreme answers:</strong> —inferences using "always," "never," or "must" are usually wrong unless the passage strongly supports such certainty.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Test each answer: —ask "Does the passage actually support this conclusion, or am I bringing in outside assumptions?" For difficult inference questions</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">work backwards: consider what evidence would support each answer choice, then check if that evidence exists in the passage.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Vocabulary-in-Context Questions: Word Meaning in Passage </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Vocabulary-in-Context questions test your understanding of how a specific word is used within the passage, not your knowledge of the word's dictionary definition in isolation. Question stems typically follow this format: "As it is used in line X, the word 'Y' most nearly means..." The word tested might be relatively simple (like "run" or "charged") but used in an unusual way, or it might be a more sophisticated term whose meaning becomes clear from context.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The key is that you must determine the word's meaning as used in this specific passage, not its general meaning. Wrong answers often include other definitions of the word that don't fit the passage's context, synonyms that are close but not quite right, or words that sound similar but have different meanings.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Strategies for Vocabulary-in-Context Questions </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Read the sentence containing the word:</strong> plus the sentences before and after to understand context fully.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Substitute answer choices:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">into the sentence</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">which one preserves the sentence's meaning and sounds natural?</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Ignore other meanings:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">you know the word can have</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">focus only on how it works in this passage</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Look for context clues:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">like synonyms</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">or explanations in surrounding sentences</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Eliminate answers: that don't make sense in the sentence's context. A helpful technique: cover the word in the passage and predict what word should go there based on context, then find the answer choice closest to your prediction</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Don't overthink these questions—the correct answer should feel natural when substituted into the sentence.</li></ul> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Example: Inference vs. Vocabulary Question:</strong> Passage: "Though the experiment yielded promising preliminary results, Dr. Martinez cautioned against drawing definitive conclusions until additional trials could be conducted with larger sample sizes."</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Inference Question:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">: "The passage suggests that Dr. Martinez believes..." Correct answer: "further research is needed to confirm the findings" (logical inference from "cautioned against definitive conclusions" and "additional trials") Wrong answer: "the experiment was a complete failure" (goes too far</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">passage says results were "promising")</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Vocabulary Question:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">: "As used in line 42</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">'yielded' most nearly means..." Correct answer: "produced" (fits context: experiment produced results) Wrong answer: "surrendered" (another meaning of yield</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">but doesn't fit this context)</li></ul></li></ul> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 3. Function/Purpose and Author's Attitude Questions </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Function and Purpose questions ask why the author included specific content or how it serves the passage's overall goals, while Author's Attitude and Tone questions test your ability to identify the author's perspective, feelings, or stance on the topic. These question types test sophisticated reading skills beyond basic comprehension.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Function and Purpose Questions: Understanding "Why" </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Function and Purpose questions ask about the rhetorical purpose of specific paragraphs, examples, quotations, or sections. Common stems include:</p><ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">"The primary function of the third paragraph is to...", "The author most likely includes the description of X in order to...", "The example in lines 45-50 primarily serves to..."</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">or "The author discusses Y mainly to..." These questions test whether you understand not just what the passage says but why the author chose to include specific content</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Authors include information to support arguments, provide examples, offer contrasts, explain background, transition between ideas, or illustrate concepts</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">The correct answer will identify the strategic purpose of the content in relation to the passage's overall argument or narrative</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Wrong answers might accurately describe what the content is about without explaining its function, or misidentify the role it plays in the passage's structure</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Strategies for Function and Purpose Questions </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Read before and after:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">the referenced section</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">purpose often becomes clear from how content connects to surrounding paragraphs</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Ask "why":</strong> —why would the author include this example, description, or detail? What does it add to the argument or narrative?</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Identify relationships:</strong> —does the content provide evidence, contrast an idea, explain background, transition topics, or illustrate a point?</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Match purpose to structure:</strong> —if a paragraph presents a problem then a solution, its purpose is likely to show how something was resolved.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Eliminate "what" answers: —choices that only describe the content without explaining its function are usually wrong</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Think about the passage as a deliberate construction where every part serves a specific architectural purpose in building the author's overall message.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Author's Attitude and Tone Questions: Reading the Author's Perspective </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">These questions ask you to identify the author's feelings, perspective, or stance toward the subject. Question stems include:</p><ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">"The author's tone in discussing X can best be described as...", "The author's attitude toward Y is primarily one of...", "The author views Z as..."</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">or "The author would most likely describe the subject as..." Tone might be objective, enthusiastic, critical, admiring, skeptical, concerned, nostalgic, analytical, or neutral</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">These questions test your ability to detect subtle clues about the author's stance through word choice, descriptive language, and rhetorical techniques</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">The correct answer will be supported by specific language in the passage, while wrong answers often are too extreme (describing the tone as "outraged" when it's merely "concerned") or misread neutral analysis as emotional response</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Strategies for Author's Attitude Questions </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">For these questions: Look for emotionally loaded words—adjectives like "remarkable," "unfortunate," "brilliant," or "problematic" reveal the author's stance. Notice what the author emphasizes—spending extensive time praising something suggests admiration; focusing on limitations suggests skepticism.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Distinguish fact from opinion—factual, balanced presentation suggests objective tone; evaluative language suggests a subjective stance. Check for consistency—the author's tone should be relatively consistent throughout unless there's a clear shift.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Eliminate extremes—unless the passage uses very strong language, avoid tone words like "hostile," "ecstatic," or "contemptuous." Most ACT passages have moderate, measured tones even when the author clearly favors one side of an issue.</p> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Example: Function vs. Tone Question:</strong> Passage includes a paragraph describing how a painter's early struggles with poverty shaped his later work's themes of social inequality.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Function Question:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">: "The primary function of paragraph 3 is to..." Correct answer: "explain how personal experience influenced the artist's thematic choices" (identifies the rhetorical purpose) Wrong answer: "describe the artist's childhood" (what it does, not why</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">this misses the function)</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Tone Question:: "The author's attitude toward the artist can best be described as..." Passage uses words like "admirably persevered," "profound empathy</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">" "remarkable insight" Correct answer: "respectful and appreciative" (matches the positive language) Wrong answer: "neutral and objective" (misses the clear admiration in the descriptive language)</li></ul> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 4. Comparison Questions and Question Type Integration </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Comparison questions appear when passages include dual texts or when questions ask you to compare elements within a single passage. Understanding how to integrate your knowledge of all question types creates a comprehensive approach to the Reading section.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Comparison Questions: Analyzing Relationships </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Comparison questions ask you to identify similarities, differences, or relationships between two passages, two perspectives within a passage, or two elements discussed in the passage. Common stems include:</p><ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">"Both passages suggest that...", "Unlike Passage A, Passage B emphasizes...", "The two authors would most likely agree about...", "How does the author's view of X differ from their view of Y?"</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">or "Compared to the description of A, the description of B is more..." These questions test your ability to hold multiple perspectives in mind simultaneously and analyze their relationships</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">The correct answer will accurately characterize the nature of the similarity or difference, while wrong answers often overstate agreement, exaggerate differences, or misidentify which passage holds which view</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Strategies for Comparison Questions </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Create a mental comparison chart:</strong> —note what each passage or element says about the topic being compared.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Look for explicit contrasts:</strong> —passages often use transition words like "however," "in contrast," or "unlike" to signal differences.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Identify areas of overlap:</strong> —where both passages discuss the same subtopic, how do their perspectives differ?</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Be precise:</strong> —the correct answer will accurately reflect the specific nature of the similarity or difference, not just that one exists.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Check both passages: —verify that the answer accurately represents what each passage says, not just one</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">For dual passage questions, annotate Passage A with "A" and Passage B with "B" to avoid confusion when questions reference specific passages.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Recognizing Question Types Quickly </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Developing the ability to instantly identify question types saves valuable time and helps you apply appropriate strategies automatically. Create mental associations: "main idea" or "primary purpose" → think big picture, entire passage. "According to" or line references → detail question, locate and verify. "Suggests" or "implies" → inference question, read between lines carefully. "As used in line" → vocabulary question, substitute and check context.
