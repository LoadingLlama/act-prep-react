Skills 1-3: Foundation Time Management Techniques </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The first three time management skills establish the foundation for effective pacing: understanding your target timing, using checkpoint systems, and wearing a reliable watch. These fundamental techniques provide the structure needed for all other pacing strategies to work effectively.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Skill 1: Know Your Target Time Per Passage </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The standard advice is to spend approximately 8 minutes and 45 seconds per passage (35 minutes ÷ 4 passages = 8:45). However, this equal distribution rarely represents the optimal strategy.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Instead, determine your personalized time targets based on your strengths and weaknesses. If you excel at fiction but struggle with science, consider allocating 8 minutes to fiction, 8:30 to humanities, 9 minutes to social science, and 9:30 to natural science.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Or if you're consistently strong across all types, you might budget 8:15 per passage to build in a 2-minute buffer for review or difficult questions. Calculate your targets before test day and practice with them consistently so they become automatic.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Write them down on your practice tests until you've internalized the timing.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Skill 2: Use Time Checkpoints Throughout Each Passage </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Rather than only checking the clock at the end of each passage, establish internal checkpoints that help you maintain pace. For an 8:45-per-passage target, your checkpoints might be: start reading at 0:00, finish reading by 3:30, complete question 5 by 6:00, finish all 10 questions by 8:45.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">These checkpoints serve as early warning signals—if you're significantly behind at the midpoint checkpoint, you know to speed up or make strategic choices about which questions to skip. Checkpoints prevent the all-too-common scenario where you spend 6 minutes reading, don't realize you're behind schedule, then panic when you have only 2:45 for all 10 questions.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">During practice, experiment to find checkpoint times that work for your reading strategy. Some students prefer checkpoints based on passage sections (first paragraph by 0:45, halfway through passage by 2:00) while others prefer question-based checkpoints.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Skill 3: Wear a Reliable Watch </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">This seems obvious, but many students overlook this critical tool. Wear a watch—preferably an analog watch since it provides a visual representation of time passing that's easier to process at a glance than digital numbers.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Smartwatches and digital devices are prohibited, so use a simple analog or digital wristwatch. Some testing centers have wall clocks, but they may be positioned poorly, broken, or inconsistent with the proctor's official time.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Never rely on room clocks. Before starting the Reading section, note the current time and calculate when 35 minutes will expire.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Some students find it helpful to set their watch to 12:00 when the section begins, making time tracking simpler (passage one ends at 12:08:45, passage two at 12:17:30, etc.). Practice with your watch during prep so checking it becomes a quick, automatic glance rather than a distracting interruption.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Creating Your Personal Pacing Plan </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">you simply execute the plan you've practiced. Many high-scoring students report that having a solid pacing plan reduces anxiety because they feel in control of time rather than controlled by it. Your plan might look like: "Passage 1 (Fiction): 8:00 total</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">reading done by 3:00, Q5 by 5:30, done by 8:00. Passage 2 (Social Science): 8:30 total</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">reading done by 3:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">done by 16:30 overall</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">" and so on</li></ul></li></ul> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Strong): Target 8:00 total - Checkpoint 1: Reading complete by 3:00 - Checkpoint 2: Question 5 complete by 5:30 - Checkpoint 3: All questions done by 8:00 Passage 2 (Social Science</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Moderate): Target 8:30 total - Reading complete by 11:30 (3:00 after start) - Question 5 complete by 14:00 - All questions done by 16:30 Practice this exact plan until checking time and adjusting pace becomes automatic</li></ul> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 2. Skills 4-6: Strategic Decision-Making Under Time Pressure </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The next three skills focus on making smart strategic decisions when time becomes tight: knowing when to skip questions, triaging passages, and avoiding time sinks. These skills transform time pressure from a paralyzing problem into a manageable challenge.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Skill 4: Master the Art of Strategic Skipping </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">we naturally want to "solve" hard problems</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">but it's essential for maximizing overall score. Remember: leaving one hard question to answer three easy ones is an excellent trade</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">The key is making skipping decisions consciously and strategically, not out of panic. During practice, develop your skip threshold</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">the specific time limit after which you'll skip a question. For most students, 45-60 seconds is optimal</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">faster readers might use 30-45 seconds while slower readers might allow 60-90 seconds</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Skill 5: Triage Passages Based on Difficulty </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Passage triaging means quickly assessing each passage's difficulty and choosing an order that maximizes points. Before diving into passage one, spend 15-20 seconds scanning all four passages: read their introductory italicized text and glance at the first paragraph of each.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Identify which passages seem most accessible (familiar topics, clear writing, comfortable length) and which seem most challenging (dense prose, unfamiliar concepts, complex structure). Then create an attack order: tackle easier passages first to build confidence, bank time, and guarantee points, leaving harder passages for when you're most pressed for time.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">For example, if passages 1 and 3 look easy while passages 2 and 4 look hard, work in the order 1-3-2-4. This strategy ensures that even if you run short on time, you've maximized points on passages where you're strongest.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Mark your chosen order in your test booklet before beginning.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Skill 6: Recognize and Avoid Time Sinks </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Time sinks are activities that consume disproportionate time without proportional benefit. Common time sinks include:</p><ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">obsessively rereading the same sentence 4-5 times because it's confusing (instead, move forward and see if context clarifies it), spending 2+ minutes on a single question you're determined to solve (skip it), excessive annotation that slows your reading without improving retention (annotate only essentials), rereading entire paragraphs when you could scan for specific information</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">second-guessing answers you've already selected (trust your first choice unless you have concrete evidence it's wrong). Develop time awareness during practice by noting when you fall into these traps. Many students benefit from giving themselves explicit permission to move forward without perfect understanding</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">"good enough" comprehension plus completed questions beats perfect comprehension of three passages with one passage left blank</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Implementing Triage Decisions Quickly </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The key to effective triaging is making decisions quickly and decisively. During your initial 15-20 second passage scan, look for clear signals of difficulty: Does the passage use extremely dense or technical language? Does it have an unusual or confusing structure? Does the topic seem completely unfamiliar? If yes to multiple questions, mark it as "harder" and save it for later.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Conversely, passages with conversational tone, clear organization, or familiar topics should be marked as "easier" and tackled first. Don't overthink this assessment—your gut instinct after a quick scan is usually accurate.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Some students mark passages with E (easy), M (medium), or H (hard) in the corner of each passage, then work through them in E-M-H order. This systematic approach ensures you maximize points even if time runs short on the hardest passage.</p> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Example:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Strategic Skipping in Action: You're on question 7 of a passage, currently at the 6:30 mark (target is 6:00 for question 5</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">you're slightly behind)</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Question 7 is a complex inference question requiring you to synthesize information from three different paragraphs.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Without skipping strategy:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">: You spend 2 minutes working through the question, finish at 8:30, and now have only 0:15 for the last 3 questions</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">likely missing those</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">With skipping strategy:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">: After 45 seconds</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">you recognize this is a time sink. You eliminate two obviously wrong answers</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">guess between the remaining two</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">circle it in your booklet</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">move on. You spend 5 minutes on the remaining 3 questions (which are easier), answering them correctly. Total: 4 questions right (including 3 easy ones you had time for) vs. maybe 2 questions right in the rushed scenario.</li></ul> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 3. Skills 7-9: Advanced Pacing Techniques </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Skills 7-9 represent advanced techniques that separate good time managers from exceptional ones: banking time, calibrating reading speed, and using question difficulty patterns. These skills require practice to implement but can significantly boost your score.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Skill 7: Bank Time on Easy Passages for Hard Ones </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">do your easiest passage first, finish it in 7:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">and you've banked 1:15 of extra time for the hardest passage. However</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">be careful not to sacrifice accuracy for speed</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">banking time only helps if you're still getting questions correct. The ideal scenario is completing easy passages both quickly and accurately by using efficient reading strategies, making quick decisions on straightforward questions</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">avoiding unnecessary rereading. Track your time banking during practice: if you consistently finish your strongest passage type in under 8 minutes with 9-10 questions correct, you're successfully banking time. Use this banked time strategically on your weakest passage type or save it as a buffer for unexpected difficulties</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Skill 8: Calibrate Your Reading Speed to Comprehension </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Many students make the mistake of reading at a constant speed regardless of content difficulty or importance. Calibrated reading means adjusting your pace based on what you're reading.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Read introductory paragraphs and topic sentences more slowly and carefully—these set up the passage's structure and main ideas. Read detailed examples and explanations at moderate speed, noting their purpose without memorizing every fact.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Read transitional material and tangential details more quickly since they're less likely to be tested. Similarly, adjust speed based on comprehension: if you're understanding clearly, you can read faster; if you're confused, slow down to ensure comprehension rather than plowing ahead mindlessly.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">This variable-speed reading is more efficient than reading everything at the same pace. Practice this skill by consciously deciding "I need to slow down for this paragraph" or "I can skim this example" during practice passages.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Skill 9: Use Question Difficulty Patterns to Allocate Time </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">ACT Reading questions roughly follow the passage's chronological order, and easier questions often cluster at the beginning while harder inference questions appear toward the end. Use this difficulty pattern to allocate time efficiently: spend less time (20-30 seconds) on straightforward detail questions (typically questions 2-5), moderate time (30-45 seconds) on mid-range questions about author's purpose or vocabulary (questions 6-8), and more time if needed (45-60 seconds) on complex inference or comparison questions (often questions 9-10).</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">However, if a question seems unusually difficult for its position, don't waste time trying to "solve" it—skip and return if time permits. This pattern-based allocation helps you budget time appropriately: if you know questions 9-10 will likely be harder, you can move through questions 2-5 efficiently to ensure adequate time for the challenging finish.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Building Mental Stamina for Sustained Focus </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">it requires mental stamina to maintain focus and decision-making quality for 35 uninterrupted minutes. Build this stamina through practice: regularly complete full Reading sections (all four passages) under timed conditions, not just individual passages</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Practice when you're tired or distracted to simulate less-than-ideal testing conditions. Develop a mental reset technique</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">when you feel focus wavering, close your eyes for 3 seconds, take a deep breath, and refocus. During practice, note when your concentration tends to drop (often during the third passage, when fatigue sets in) and develop strategies to push through</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Some students benefit from very brief mental breaks (5 seconds of stretching, deep breathing) between passages to reset focus without wasting significant time. Building stamina also means taking care of physical needs: get good sleep before practice and test day, eat protein-rich meals, stay hydrated, and minimize sugar crashes</li></ul> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Prose Fiction about familiar topic): Finish in 7:45 (0:60 banked) Passage 2 (Moderate</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Social Science): Finish in 8:30 (0:15 banked, total banked: 1:15) Passage 3 (Moderate</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Humanities): Finish in 8:45 (no time banked, total remains 1:15) Passage 4 (Hard</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Complex Natural Science):<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Use 10:00 (8:45 standard + 1:15 banked) Result: The extra time on the hard passage allows careful reading and thorough question analysis</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">improving accuracy where you need it most. Without banking</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">you'd have been rushed on the hard passage and likely missed more questions</li></ul></li></ul> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 4. Skill 10: Emergency Strategies and Final Time Management </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The final time management skill addresses what to do when despite your best planning, time runs critically short: implementing emergency protocols, making rapid triage decisions, and ensuring you bubble in an answer for every question. These techniques serve as your safety net when time pressure becomes extreme.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> When You Have 2 Minutes Left and Haven't Finished </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">immediately bubble in a letter of the day (pick one letter, like C</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">bubble it for all remaining questions) to ensure nothing is left blank—you can always change answers if you have time</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">quickly scan remaining questions to identify any that you can answer with minimal reading—often vocabulary questions</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">questions with line references, or questions about specific details you remember. Tackle these quick-point opportunities first</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">for any questions you attempt, use aggressive process of elimination to narrow choices, then select from remaining options</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Do not try to read carefully with less than 2 minutes remaining—you won't have time. Focus on maximizing points through strategic guessing and targeting answerable questions rather than trying to comprehend new passage content</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> The 5-Minute Warning Protocol </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">When you have 5 minutes left, conduct a quick status check: How many questions remain? Can you realistically finish in 5 minutes at your current pace? If yes, continue with your strategy. If no, implement a modified approach: stop reading carefully and switch to scanning for answers, prioritize questions with line references or specific details over broad inference questions, and reduce your per-question time target from 45 seconds to 30 seconds.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Make peace with the fact that you won't answer every question perfectly—focus on maximizing total points. For questions that would require extensive rereading or complex analysis, make an educated guess based on partial information and move on.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The 5-minute mark is your final opportunity to make strategic adjustments before time pressure becomes critical.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Never Leave Questions Blank </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">This point bears repeating: there is no guessing penalty on the ACT, so blank answers guarantee zero points while guesses give you a 20-25% chance (depending on whether you've eliminated any choices). In the final 30 seconds, if any questions remain unanswered, bubble in your letter of the day for all of them.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Some students worry that guessing will hurt their score, but this is mathematically impossible with no guessing penalty. In fact, random guessing on 10 questions should yield 2-3 correct answers on average—that's 2-3 points you'd lose by leaving them blank.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">If you've used any process of elimination to narrow choices, your odds improve further. Make a habit during practice of always filling in every bubble, even if you're purely guessing, so this becomes automatic on test day.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Learning from Timing Failures in Practice </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Every time you run out of time during practice, treat it as a learning opportunity rather than a failure. After completing the practice test, analyze what went wrong: Did you spend too long reading? Did you get stuck on particular question types? Did you fail to skip difficult questions? Did you misjudge passage difficulty and tackle them in the wrong order? Did your checkpoints fail to alert you to time trouble soon enough? Based on this analysis, adjust your strategy and try again.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Many students find that their timing improves dramatically after 4-6 full practice Reading sections once they've identified and corrected their specific timing issues. Keep a timing log during practice: record how long you actually spend on each passage, where you tend to fall behind, and what strategies help you stay on pace.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">This data-driven approach to improvement is far more effective than vaguely trying to "go faster."</p> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Situation::</strong> You check your watch at minute 33:00.
