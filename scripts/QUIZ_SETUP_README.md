# Quiz System Setup Instructions

This guide will help you set up the quiz system in Supabase for your ACT Prep application.

## Overview

The quiz system has been migrated from hardcoded JavaScript to Supabase for better scalability and management. Quizzes are now:
- Stored in Supabase database tables
- Fetched dynamically per lesson
- Track user progress and completion
- **Block lesson progression until completed** (for required quizzes)

## Database Schema

The quiz system uses 4 main tables:
1. **quizzes** - Quiz metadata (title, intro, type, position in lesson)
2. **quiz_questions** - Individual questions for each quiz
3. **quiz_options** - Answer options for each question
4. **user_quiz_progress** - Tracks user completion and scores

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Create Database Tables

Run the SQL schema in your Supabase SQL editor:

```bash
# Copy the contents of create-quiz-tables.sql and run it in Supabase
cat scripts/create-quiz-tables.sql
```

Or go to your Supabase project â†’ SQL Editor â†’ New Query, then paste and execute the contents of `scripts/create-quiz-tables.sql`.

### Step 2: Migrate Quiz Data

After creating the tables, populate them with quiz data:

```bash
node scripts/migrate-quizzes-to-supabase.mjs
```

This will:
- Fetch all quizzes from `lessonQuizData.js`
- Link them to the appropriate lesson
- Insert all questions and answer options
- Set quiz positions and types

### Step 3: Verify Migration

Check that quizzes were created successfully:

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT
  q.id,
  q.title,
  q.quiz_type,
  q.position,
  COUNT(qq.id) as question_count,
  l.title as lesson_title
FROM quizzes q
LEFT JOIN quiz_questions qq ON qq.quiz_id = q.id
LEFT JOIN lessons l ON l.id = q.lesson_id
GROUP BY q.id, l.title
ORDER BY q.position;
```

## Quiz Types

- **practice** - Practice quizzes throughout the lesson
- **checkpoint** - Mid-lesson assessment
- **final** - Final mastery test (shows special completion message)

## Quiz Positions

Quizzes are inserted at specific positions in the lesson:
- **0** - Before any content (intro quiz)
- **1** - After first text section
- **2** - After second text section
- **N** - After Nth text section

Example for Sentence Structure lesson:
- Position 1: Clause Identification Quiz (practice)
- Position 2: FANBOYS & Compound Sentences (checkpoint)
- Position 3: Comma Splices & Fragments (practice)
- Position 4: Final Mastery Test (final)

## How It Works

### In the Code

1. **ProgressiveLessonRenderer.js** fetches quizzes when lesson loads:
   ```javascript
   const quizzes = await QuizzesService.getQuizzesByLessonId(lesson.id);
   ```

2. Quizzes are inserted into the lesson flow based on `position` field

3. **InteractiveQuiz.js** displays the quiz and tracks completion

4. Users **cannot advance** past a quiz until they complete it (handled by `LessonSection.js` and `ProgressiveLessonRenderer.js`)

### User Progress Tracking

When a user completes a quiz:
```javascript
QuizzesService.saveQuizProgress(userId, quizId, score, totalQuestions, answers);
```

This saves to `user_quiz_progress` table with:
- Score
- Total questions
- User's answers (JSON)
- Completion timestamp

## Adding New Quizzes

### Via Supabase UI

1. Insert into `quizzes` table:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO quizzes (lesson_id, title, intro, quiz_type, position, is_required)
   VALUES (1, 'My New Quiz', 'Test your knowledge', 'practice', 2, true);
   ```

2. Insert questions into `quiz_questions`:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO quiz_questions (quiz_id, question_text, question_order)
   VALUES (5, 'What is a clause?', 0);
   ```

3. Insert options into `quiz_options`:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO quiz_options (question_id, option_text, is_correct, explanation, option_order)
   VALUES (10, 'A group of words with subject and verb', true, 'Correct!', 0);
   ```

### Via Migration Script

1. Add quiz data to `lessonQuizData.js`
2. Update `migrate-quizzes-to-supabase.mjs` with new quiz ID mapping
3. Run the migration script again

## Checking Quiz Completion

To check if a user has completed all required quizzes for a lesson:

```javascript
const allCompleted = await QuizzesService.hasCompletedRequiredQuizzes(userId, lessonId);
```

This is used to determine if the "Next Lesson" button should be enabled.

## Row Level Security (RLS)

The tables have RLS enabled:
- **Quizzes/Questions/Options**: Readable by everyone
- **User Quiz Progress**: Users can only see/modify their own progress

## Troubleshooting

### Quizzes not appearing
- Check that `lesson.id` is correctly set
- Verify quizzes exist in database for that lesson_id
- Check browser console for errors

### User progress not saving
- Verify user is authenticated (userId exists)
- Check RLS policies are correctly set
- Ensure `user_quiz_progress` table exists

### Migration script fails
- Ensure `.env` has correct Supabase credentials
- Check that lesson exists with `lesson_key = 'sentence-structure'`
- Verify tables were created first

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Tables created in Supabase
2. âœ… Quiz data migrated
3. âœ… Quiz service implemented
4. âœ… ProgressiveLessonRenderer updated to fetch from Supabase
5. âœ… Quizzes block progression until completed
6. ðŸ”„ Add quizzes to other lessons as needed
7. ðŸ”„ Build admin UI for managing quizzes (optional)

## Benefits

- **Scalable**: Add quizzes without code changes
- **Centralized**: All quiz data in one place
- **User Progress**: Track what students have completed
- **Flexible**: Easy to reorder, edit, or add new quizzes
- **Required Quizzes**: Block progression until mastery is demonstrated
