Chapter 15: Systems of Equations
A system of equations is a set of two equations with the same set of unknowns. The ACT most commonly
hides systems of equations questions in word problems. You will need to turn the word problem into two
equations and then solve for one or both unknowns.
Before we tackle the word problems, let’s start with how to solve a system of equations when we are given the
equations. The easiest methods are elimination and substitution. You will need to be familiar with both of
these methods to solve systems of equations questions correctly.

Elimination
We cannot solve an equation with two variables, so elimination is all about trying to eliminate one variable and
get an equation with only one unknown that can be solved. To do this, we need to make the coefficients for
one variable have the same value and opposite signs in the two equations. With addition, one of the variables
will cancel out, leaving us an equation with just one unknown that can be solved.
Example 1: If 10x — 4y = 16 and 2x + 4y = 8, what is the value of y?
A.

1

B. 2

C. 4

D. 8

Solution: Whenever we have a system of equation where none of the variables are already isolated,
“elimination” 1s the fastest way to get to the answer. Since we are asked to solve for y, we want to cancel the
x-terms. To do so, we multiply the second equation by —5.
10x —4y = 16

—5 (2x
+ 4y = 8)
10x —4y = 16
—10x — 20y = —40

Next, add the equations together and solve for y. Notice that the x-terms cancel out.
—24y = —24
y=1
The answer is A.

Substitution
In substitution, we want to isolate one variable in the fastest and easiest way possible. Once we have an
isolated variable, we can substitute that value into the other equation and have an equation with one variable
that we can solve.
Example 2: If 12x + 8y = 8 and y = 6x — 14, what does x equal?
A.

—2

B.

1

C. 2

D. 7

Solution: If we are given a question where one of the variables is already isolated, use the “substitution”
method. In this question, y is already isolated. We know that y = 6x — 14 from the second equation, so we
can substitute 6x — 14 for the y in the first equation.

12x
+ 8(6x —14) =8
12x +48x-—112=8
60x -112 =8

- 128

60x = 120
x=

The answer is C.

Word Problems
Many word problems are systems of equations questions in disguise. For these questions, the biggest
challenge is turning the words into equations. If you can do that successfully, you then just need to solve the
system of equations. Systems of equations questions on the ACT most commonly look something like this:

Example 3: For her garden, Mary buys 42 plants for a total of $108. Mary is only going to plant

tomatoes and peppers. If a tomato plant costs $3.00 and pepper plant costs $2.00, how many pepper plants
did Mary buy?
A.

10

B.

12

C.

16

D.

18

Solution: Let x be the number of tomato plants and y be the number of pepper plants. We can write two
equations. The first equation comes from the fact that we know Mary bought a total of 42 plants.
x+y
= 42

The second equation includes the prices of each plant to add to the total amount of money Mary spent buying
the 42 plants.
3x + 2y = 108

Once we have these two equations, we can use elimination to solve. We are solving for the number of pepper
plants, y, so we can eliminate the tomato plants, x, by multiplying the first equation by —3.

—3(x+ y = 42)
3x + 2y = 108
—3x —3y = —126
3x + 2y = 108

Next, add the equations together and solve for y. Notice that the x-terms cancel out.
—y=-18
y=18
The answer is D.

On more challenging questions, there can be more than two unknowns, and we will need to write more than 2
equations.

Example 4: Malik made $738 selling his artwork this month and is counting his cash. Malik only has $1,

$5, and $20 bills. He counts and notices that he has 5 more $5 bills than $20 bills and 6 more $1 bills than
$5 bills. How many $1 bills does Malik have?
A.

33

B. 38

C. 48

D. 53

Solution: Method #1 — “Math Teacher Way”: Let x be the number of $1 bills, y be the number of $5 bills,
and z be the number of $20 bills. We can write three equations. First, we are told that Malik has $738. To
find the total amount of money Malik has, we multiply the number of bills by the dollar amount of each bill.

Those must add up to a total of $738.
1x + 5y + 202 = 738

- 129
-

math

We have one equation with three unknowns. Well, that looks no fun! We cannot solve an equation with three
unknowns, so we need to write a few more equations with the rest of the information from the question.

We are told Malik has 5 more $5 bills than $20 bills and 6 more $1 bills than $5 bills, so the other equations
are

zZz+5=y
yt6o=x

We are asked to solve for $1 bills, which is x, so we want to put y and z in terms of x. First, let’s use the
equation y + 6 = x above to solve for y in terms of x. Subtracting 6 from both sides we get
y=x-6

Next, we need to solve for z in terms of x. To do so, we can plug in x — 6 for y in the equation z + 5 = y.
Z+5=x-6
Z=x-—11

Now that we have y and z in terms of x, we can plug these values into our first equations and solve for x.
1x +5(* — 6) + 20(x — 11) = 738
1x + 5x — 30+ 20x — 220 = 738
26x = 988
x = 38

The answer is B. Okay...that was not easy. Good news! There is an easier way to solve questions like this.

Method 2 — Backsolve: The answer choices tell us the possible number of $1 bills. We can use the answer
choices and play guess-and-check to see which one is correct. Let’s say we are going to check if answer
choice B works or not.

Answer choice B says there are 38 $1 bills. If there are 6 more $1 bills than $5 bills, there would be 32 $5
bills. If there are 5 more $5 bills than $20 bills, there would be 27 $20 bills. Now, we just need to see if the

total is equal to $738.
38(1) + 32(5) + 27(20) = 738
38 $1 bills worked to get a total of $738, so the answer is B.

None of the other answer choices would give you $738. That’s much easier than doing all that fancy algebra,
right? For questions with more than 2 unknown values, always backsolve using the answer choices.
