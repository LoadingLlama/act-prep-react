Mixing questions test your ability to <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">track changes when substances combine</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">predict properties of mixtures based on components</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">understand concentration and dilution relationships</strong>, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">interpret how mixing affects physical and chemical properties</strong>. These questions appear in chemistry passages about solutions, biology passages about cell environments, and physics passages about thermal mixing or combined systems. This lesson teaches you systematic approaches for analyzing mixing scenarios, explains how to predict mixture properties using weighted averages and proportional reasoning, provides strategies for tracking concentrations through dilution and combination, and shows you how to avoid common misconceptions about additive versus non-additive properties when substances combine.

1. Understanding Additive and Non-Additive Properties in Mixtures
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
The first critical concept is distinguishing between properties that <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">add directly</strong> when substances mix and properties that <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">must be averaged or calculated differently</strong>.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Additive Properties: Mass, Volume, and Extensive Quantities
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Additive properties</strong> (also called extensive properties) sum directly when substances combine: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Mass</strong>: If you mix 100 g of solution A with 200 g of solution B, the total mass is 300 g (assuming no chemical reaction that changes mass). Mass conservation means masses add. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Volume (usually)</strong>: In most cases, mixing 50 mL of liquid A with 30 mL of liquid B gives approximately 80 mL total. However, some liquids show volume contraction when mixed (alcohol and water), but ACT typically assumes additive volumes unless stated otherwise. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Amount of substance</strong>: If solution A contains 2 moles of solute and solution B contains 3 moles, the mixture contains 5 moles total. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Energy content</strong> (in many cases): Total calories, total joules, or total chemical energy often adds when systems combine. The key characteristic: these properties depend on the amount of material, so doubling the amount doubles the property. When materials combine, these quantities sum.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Non-Additive Properties: Concentration, Density, Temperature, and Intensive Quantities
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Non-additive properties</strong> (intensive properties) require weighted averaging or other calculations: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Concentration</strong>: If you mix equal volumes of 2 M solution and 6 M solution, the result is NOT 8 M—it's 4 M (the average). Concentrations must be calculated from total solute divided by total volume. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Density</strong>: Mixing 100 mL of liquid with density 1.2 g/mL with 100 mL of liquid with density 0.8 g/mL doesn't give density 2.0 g/mL—you must calculate: total mass = (100×1.2) + (100×0.8) = 200 g, total volume = 200 mL, so density = 200/200 = 1.0 g/mL. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Temperature</strong>: Mixing equal amounts of water at 20°C and 80°C gives approximately 50°C (weighted average by heat capacity and mass), not 100°C. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">pH, pressure, color intensity</strong>: These are also non-additive. The key characteristic: these properties are ratios or averages, independent of total amount. Doubling the amount doesn't change density or concentration of a uniform mixture. Never add intensive properties directly—they require proper calculation.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Identifying Property Types in Questions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
To quickly determine if a property is <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">additive or non-additive</strong>: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Ask: "Is this a total or a rate/ratio?"</strong> Totals (mass, volume, moles) are additive. Ratios (concentration = moles/volume, density = mass/volume) are non-additive. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Ask: "Does doubling the sample double this property?"</strong> If yes (like mass), it's additive. If no (like density—doubling sample size doesn't change density), it's non-additive. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Common additive</strong>: total mass, total volume, total moles, total atoms, total energy (often). (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Common non-additive</strong>: concentration (M, %, ppm), density (g/mL), temperature (°C), pH, pressure (in closed systems), percent composition. When a question asks about a mixture property, first identify its type to know whether to add values or calculate weighted averages. This distinction prevents the most common mixing question errors.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Special Case: Properties That Don't Mix Linearly
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Some properties show <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">non-linear behavior</strong> when substances mix: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">pH</strong>: Because pH is a logarithmic scale, mixing equal volumes of pH 2 and pH 4 solutions does NOT give pH 3. The [H⁺] concentrations must be averaged, then converted back to pH. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Color intensity with absorption</strong>: Light absorption may not be additive if substances interact chemically. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Electrical conductivity</strong>: Can be non-linear if ions interact or precipitate when solutions mix. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Chemical reactions</strong>: If mixing causes a reaction (acid + base → salt + water), properties can change unpredictably—heat may be released, pH may change dramatically, precipitates may form. For ACT purposes: (a) Simple mixing without reaction usually follows weighted average rules for intensive properties. (b) If a passage mentions a reaction occurs, read carefully for specific information about resulting properties. (c) pH mixing questions are rare and typically provide enough information to solve them. The key is recognizing when simple averaging applies versus when more complex effects occur.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Additive vs. Non-Additive Properties</strong><br><br>
<strong>Scenario:</strong> Mix 200 mL of 3 M NaCl solution with 100 mL of 6 M NaCl solution<br><br>
<strong>Additive - Volume:</strong> 200 + 100 = 300 mL total<br><br>
<strong>Additive - Moles of NaCl:</strong><br>
From solution 1: 200 mL × 3 mol/L = 0.2 L × 3 = 0.6 mol<br>
From solution 2: 100 mL × 6 mol/L = 0.1 L × 6 = 0.6 mol<br>
Total: 0.6 + 0.6 = 1.2 mol<br><br>
<strong>Non-Additive - Concentration:</strong><br>
WRONG: 3 M + 6 M = 9 M<br>
CORRECT: Total moles / Total volume = 1.2 mol / 0.3 L = 4 M<br>
Or: Weighted average = (200×3 + 100×6) / 300 = (600 + 600) / 300 = 4 M<br><br>
<strong>Key insight:</strong> The moles add (0.6 + 0.6 = 1.2), but concentration is the ratio of total moles to total volume
</p>

2. Calculating Mixture Concentrations and Dilutions
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Concentration problems are the most common mixing questions, requiring you to <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">track solute amounts</strong> and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">calculate final concentrations</strong> after mixing or diluting.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
The Fundamental Mixing Equation for Concentrations
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">universal approach</strong> to mixing concentration problems: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Calculate solute amount in each component</strong>: Amount = Concentration × Volume. Do this for each solution being mixed. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Sum the solute amounts</strong>: Total solute = Sum of all individual solute amounts. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Sum the volumes</strong>: Total volume = Sum of all individual volumes. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Calculate final concentration</strong>: Final concentration = Total solute / Total volume. This method works for any concentration units (molarity, percent, ppm) as long as you're consistent. For example, mixing 50 mL of 4% solution with 150 mL of 8% solution: Solute₁ = 50 × 0.04 = 2 mL; Solute₂ = 150 × 0.08 = 12 mL; Total solute = 14 mL; Total volume = 200 mL; Final concentration = 14/200 = 0.07 = 7%. This systematic approach prevents errors and works for any number of solutions being mixed.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Weighted Average Method for Equal or Simple Ratios
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
For certain mixing scenarios, a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">weighted average</strong> provides a shortcut: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Equal volumes</strong>: If mixing equal volumes of different concentrations, the result is the simple average. Mix 100 mL of 2 M with 100 mL of 8 M → final concentration = (2 + 8)/2 = 5 M. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Different volumes</strong>: The final concentration is weighted by volumes: C_final = (V₁C₁ + V₂C₂)/(V₁ + V₂). Mix 200 mL of 3 M with 100 mL of 9 M → (200×3 + 100×9)/(200+100) = (600 + 900)/300 = 5 M. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Reasoning check</strong>: The final concentration must be between the two starting concentrations. If you get a result outside this range, you made an error. With 3 M and 9 M, the result must be between 3 and 9 M. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Dominant component</strong>: The final concentration is closer to the concentration of the larger volume component. Mixing 900 mL of 2 M with 100 mL of 8 M gives a result closer to 2 M than to 8 M: (900×2 + 100×8)/1000 = 2.6 M. The weighted average method is mathematically equivalent to the fundamental method but can be faster for simple cases.

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Dilution Problems: Adding Pure Solvent
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Dilution</strong> is mixing a solution with pure solvent (concentration = 0): (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Key principle</strong>: The amount of solute doesn't change, only the volume increases. Moles before = Moles after, so C₁V₁ = C₂V₂. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Dilution equation</strong>: C₁V₁ = C₂V₂, where subscript 1 is before dilution, subscript 2 is after. If you start with 100 mL of 6 M and dilute to 300 mL total: (6 M)(100 mL) = C₂(300 mL) → C₂ = 600/300 = 2 M. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Volume added vs. final volume</strong>: Be careful whether the question states "add 200 mL of water" (final volume = original + 200) or "dilute to 300 mL total" (final volume = 300). These are different. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Dilution factor</strong>: If volume triples (×3), concentration becomes one-third (÷3). If volume is halved (though that's concentration, not dilution), concentration doubles. For example, adding 500 mL water to 100 mL of 12 M solution: Final volume = 600 mL (6× original), so final concentration = 12/6 = 2 M. Alternatively, (12)(100) = C₂(600) → C₂ = 2 M.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Percent Composition and Mass Mixing
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
When concentrations are given as <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">percent by mass</strong> or <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">mass ratios</strong>: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Percent by mass = (mass of solute / total mass) × 100%</strong>. A 15% salt solution means 15 g salt per 100 g solution. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">For mixing</strong>: Calculate mass of solute in each component, sum them, then divide by total mass. Mix 200 g of 10% solution with 300 g of 25% solution: Solute₁ = 200 × 0.10 = 20 g; Solute₂ = 300 × 0.25 = 75 g; Total solute = 95 g; Total mass = 500 g; Final % = 95/500 = 0.19 = 19%. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Weighted average for mass percent</strong>: (mass₁ × %₁ + mass₂ × %₂)/(mass₁ + mass₂). Same example: (200×10 + 300×25)/500 = (2000 + 7500)/500 = 19%. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Converting between volume and mass</strong>: If you need to mix by volume but have mass %, use density to convert. If density = 1 g/mL (like dilute aqueous solutions), volume in mL ≈ mass in g. Mass percent problems are identical in logic to molarity problems—track the solute amount and total amount, then calculate the ratio.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Concentration Calculations</strong><br><br>
<strong>Problem 1: Mixing two solutions</strong><br>
Mix 150 mL of 0.4 M NaOH with 350 mL of 0.8 M NaOH. Find final molarity.<br>
Solute₁: 150 mL × 0.4 M = 0.150 L × 0.4 mol/L = 0.06 mol<br>
Solute₂: 350 mL × 0.8 M = 0.350 L × 0.8 mol/L = 0.28 mol<br>
Total moles: 0.06 + 0.28 = 0.34 mol<br>
Total volume: 150 + 350 = 500 mL = 0.5 L<br>
Final molarity: 0.34 mol / 0.5 L = 0.68 M<br><br>
<strong>Problem 2: Dilution</strong><br>
Dilute 75 mL of 3.0 M HCl to a final volume of 250 mL. Find final molarity.<br>
C₁V₁ = C₂V₂<br>
(3.0 M)(75 mL) = C₂(250 mL)<br>
225 = C₂(250)<br>
C₂ = 225/250 = 0.9 M<br><br>
<strong>Problem 3: Percent composition</strong><br>
Mix 400 g of 5% sugar solution with 600 g of 15% sugar solution.<br>
Sugar₁: 400 × 0.05 = 20 g<br>
Sugar₂: 600 × 0.15 = 90 g<br>
Total sugar: 110 g<br>
Total mass: 1000 g<br>
Final %: (110/1000) × 100% = 11%

3. Temperature and Thermal Mixing Problems
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Thermal mixing questions ask about <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">final temperature</strong> when substances at different temperatures combine, based on <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">heat transfer</strong> and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">thermal equilibrium</strong>.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
The Principle of Heat Exchange and Equilibrium
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
When substances at different temperatures mix: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Heat flows from hot to cold</strong> until both reach the same temperature (thermal equilibrium). (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Conservation of energy</strong>: Heat lost by hot substance = Heat gained by cold substance (assuming no heat escapes to surroundings). (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Heat equation</strong>: Q = mcΔT, where Q is heat transferred, m is mass, c is specific heat capacity, ΔT is temperature change. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">At equilibrium</strong>: Q_lost + Q_gained = 0, or Q_lost = Q_gained (taking absolute values). For ACT questions: You often don't need the full calculation if substances are identical (same specific heat). The final temperature is a weighted average based on masses. Understanding that heat exchange continues until temperatures equalize is the conceptual foundation for these problems.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Simplified Method for Identical Substances
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
When mixing the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">same substance</strong> (like water with water): (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Equal masses</strong>: Final temperature is the simple average. Mix 100 g water at 20°C with 100 g water at 60°C → T_final = (20 + 60)/2 = 40°C. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Different masses</strong>: Use weighted average: T_final = (m₁T₁ + m₂T₂)/(m₁ + m₂). Mix 200 g water at 30°C with 100 g water at 75°C → T_final = (200×30 + 100×75)/(200+100) = (6000 + 7500)/300 = 45°C. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Reasoning check</strong>: Final temperature must be between the two starting temperatures. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Effect of mass ratio</strong>: The final temperature is closer to the temperature of the larger mass. If you add a small amount of hot water to a large amount of cold water, the temperature increases slightly from the cold value. This simplified method works because specific heat cancels out when the substance is the same: m₁c(T_f - T₁) = m₂c(T₂ - T_f) → the c values cancel, leaving a mass-weighted average.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Mixing Different Substances with Different Heat Capacities
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
When substances have <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">different specific heats</strong>: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Heat lost = Heat gained</strong>: m₁c₁(T₁ - T_f) = m₂c₂(T_f - T₂), where subscript 1 is the hotter substance losing heat, subscript 2 is the cooler substance gaining heat. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Solving for T_f</strong>: m₁c₁T₁ - m₁c₁T_f = m₂c₂T_f - m₂c₂T₂ → m₁c₁T₁ + m₂c₂T₂ = T_f(m₁c₁ + m₂c₂) → T_f = (m₁c₁T₁ + m₂c₂T₂)/(m₁c₁ + m₂c₂). This is a weighted average where the weights include both mass and specific heat. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Effect of high specific heat</strong>: Substances with higher specific heat (like water) resist temperature change more. Adding 100 g of water at 20°C to 100 g of metal at 80°C results in a final temperature closer to 20°C than 80°C because water's specific heat is much higher. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ACT approach</strong>: These problems usually provide specific heats or ask conceptual questions about which direction temperature shifts. For conceptual questions: The substance with higher (mass × specific heat) dominates the final temperature.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Phase Changes and Heat of Fusion/Vaporization
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Special case</strong>: If mixing causes phase changes (ice melting, water boiling): (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Phase change absorbs/releases heat</strong> without changing temperature. Melting ice at 0°C stays at 0°C until fully melted, absorbing heat of fusion (334 J/g for water). (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Two-step process</strong>: (a) Heat required to melt ice = m × L_fusion. (b) Additional heat to warm melted ice to final temperature = m × c × ΔT. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Example scenario</strong>: Add ice at 0°C to warm water. The warm water cools down, giving heat to (a) melt the ice and (b) warm the resulting water. Final temperature depends on whether all ice melts. If more heat is available than needed to melt all ice, final T &gt; 0°C. If not enough heat to melt all ice, final T = 0°C with some ice remaining. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ACT approach</strong>: Questions with phase changes usually provide necessary values or ask qualitative questions like "will all the ice melt?" For calculations, use Q_total = Q_phase change + Q_temperature change. These are more complex but follow the same heat conservation principle.

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Thermal Mixing</strong><br><br>
<strong>Problem 1: Same substance, different masses</strong><br>
Mix 300 g of water at 25°C with 100 g of water at 85°C.<br>
T_final = (m₁T₁ + m₂T₂)/(m₁ + m₂)<br>
T_final = (300×25 + 100×85)/(300+100)<br>
T_final = (7500 + 8500)/400<br>
T_final = 16000/400 = 40°C<br><br>
<strong>Reasoning check:</strong> Result (40°C) is between 25°C and 85°C ✓<br>
The larger mass (300 g) was at 25°C, so final temperature is closer to 25°C than to 85°C ✓<br><br>
<strong>Problem 2: Different substances (conceptual)</strong><br>
Mix 100 g of water (c = 4.18 J/g°C) at 20°C with 100 g of metal (c = 0.45 J/g°C) at 80°C.<br>
Water's "thermal weight" = 100 × 4.18 = 418<br>
Metal's "thermal weight" = 100 × 0.45 = 45<br>
Water dominates → final temperature much closer to 20°C than to 80°C<br><br>
<strong>Exact calculation:</strong><br>
T_f = (100×4.18×20 + 100×0.45×80)/(100×4.18 + 100×0.45)<br>
T_f = (8360 + 3600)/(418 + 45) = 11960/463 ≈ 25.8°C

More complex mixing questions involve <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">multiple components</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">sequential mixing</strong>, or <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">reverse calculations</strong> to find starting conditions.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Sequential Mixing: Multiple Steps
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Sequential mixing</strong> means mixing occurs in stages: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Calculate intermediate result after first mixing</strong>, then use that as the starting point for the next mixing. You can't skip to the final answer directly. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Example</strong>: Start with 100 mL of 2 M solution. Add 100 mL of water (dilute to 200 mL, giving 1 M). Then add 200 mL of 4 M solution. Final calculation: Total moles = (0.1 L × 1 M) + (0.2 L × 4 M) = 0.1 + 0.8 = 0.9 mol; Total volume = 400 mL; Final concentration = 0.9/0.4 = 2.25 M. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Alternative approach</strong>: Track total solute through all steps. Original solute: 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 mol. Adding water doesn't change moles. Adding 200 mL of 4 M adds 0.8 mol. Total = 1.0 mol... Wait, let me recalculate: original solute is 0.2 mol, stays 0.2 mol after dilution, then adding 200 mL of 4 M adds 0.2 L × 4 = 0.8 mol, total is 1.0 mol. Final volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L. Concentration = 1.0/0.4 = 2.5 M. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Key principle</strong>: Solute moles only change when you add solution containing solute. Adding pure solvent changes volume but not moles. Track moles carefully through each step.

Mixing Three or More Components
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
When <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">multiple solutions mix simultaneously</strong>: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Extend the fundamental method</strong>: Calculate solute from each component, sum all solutes, sum all volumes, divide. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Example</strong>: Mix 50 mL of 2 M, 100 mL of 5 M, and 150 mL of 8 M. Solute₁ = 0.05 × 2 = 0.1 mol; Solute₂ = 0.1 × 5 = 0.5 mol; Solute₃ = 0.15 × 8 = 1.2 mol; Total = 1.8 mol; Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L; Concentration = 1.8/0.3 = 6 M. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Weighted average method</strong>: C_final = (V₁C₁ + V₂C₂ + V₃C₃)/(V₁ + V₂ + V₃) = (50×2 + 100×5 + 150×8)/300 = (100 + 500 + 1200)/300 = 1800/300 = 6 M. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Organization tip</strong>: Make a quick table with columns for Volume, Concentration, and Solute Amount. Fill in known values, calculate solute for each row, then sum the Solute and Volume columns. This prevents losing track of components. The logic is identical to two-component mixing, just with more terms in the sum.

Reverse Calculations: Finding Required Amounts
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Some questions ask "how much of X do you need to achieve Y concentration?": (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Set up equation with unknown</strong>: Let x = volume (or mass) of substance to add. Write the mixing equation with x as a variable. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Example</strong>: You have 200 mL of 3 M solution. How much 9 M solution must you add to make 5 M? Let x = mL of 9 M to add. Equation: (200×3 + x×9)/(200 + x) = 5. Solve: 600 + 9x = 5(200 + x) → 600 + 9x = 1000 + 5x → 4x = 400 → x = 100 mL. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Dilution reverse</strong>: "What volume of 8 M solution is needed to make 500 mL of 2 M?" Use C₁V₁ = C₂V₂: 8×V₁ = 2×500 → V₁ = 1000/8 = 125 mL. You need 125 mL of 8 M solution, diluted to 500 mL total (by adding 375 mL water). (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Reasoning check</strong>: Does the answer make sense? If making a weaker solution from a strong one, you need less than the final volume of the strong solution. If concentrating (rare), you'd need to evaporate solvent or add more solute. Setting up the equation correctly and solving carefully gives the answer.

Practical ACT Strategies for Mixing Questions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">General strategies</strong> for ACT mixing questions: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Identify the property type first</strong>: Additive (sum directly) or non-additive (requires calculation)? This determines your approach. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">For concentrations, always track solute and total separately</strong>: Calculate total solute, calculate total volume/mass, then divide. This systematic approach works for any complexity. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Use units to guide you</strong>: If concentration is mol/L, you need moles (numerator) and liters (denominator). Calculate each separately. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check reasonableness</strong>: Final concentration must be between extremes (or equal to them if one component dominates). Final temperature must be between starting temperatures. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Watch for "trick" language</strong>: "Add 100 mL" vs. "dilute to 100 mL" are very different. Read carefully. (6) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">For multi-step problems, track the state after each step</strong> rather than trying to jump to the end. (7) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Use the fundamental method when in doubt</strong>: Weighted averages are shortcuts that work in specific cases, but the method of calculating total solute ÷ total volume always works. Mixing questions have consistent logic across all contexts—understand the principles, and you can handle any variation.

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Advanced Mixing Problems</strong><br><br>
<strong>Problem 1: Sequential mixing</strong><br>
Start: 100 mL of 6 M HCl<br>
Step 1: Add 200 mL water → dilute to 300 mL<br>
Step 2: Add 100 mL of 3 M HCl<br>
Find final molarity.<br><br>
Track moles: Initial moles = 0.1 L × 6 M = 0.6 mol<br>
After step 1: Still 0.6 mol (water adds no solute)<br>
Step 2: Add 0.1 L × 3 M = 0.3 mol<br>
Total moles: 0.6 + 0.3 = 0.9 mol<br>
Final volume: 100 + 200 + 100 = 400 mL = 0.4 L<br>
Final molarity: 0.9 / 0.4 = 2.25 M<br><br>
<strong>Problem 2: Reverse calculation</strong><br>
You have 150 mL of 4 M solution. How much 10 M solution to add to make 6 M?<br>
Let x = mL of 10 M to add<br>
(150×4 + x×10)/(150 + x) = 6<br>
600 + 10x = 6(150 + x)<br>
600 + 10x = 900 + 6x<br>
4x = 300<br>
x = 75 mL<br><br>
<strong>Check:</strong> (150×4 + 75×10)/(150+75) = (600+750)/225 = 1350/225 = 6 M ✓
