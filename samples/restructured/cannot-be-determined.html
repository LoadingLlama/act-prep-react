Cannot-be-determined questions test your ability to <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">recognize when data is insufficient</strong> to answer a question, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">identify what information is missing</strong> from figures or passages, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">distinguish between answerable and unanswerable questions</strong> based on given data, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">avoid making assumptions beyond what the data supports</strong>. Unlike standard questions where you extract specific values or identify trends from available data, these questions specifically assess whether you understand the limitations of the provided information and can recognize when extrapolation, assumptions, or additional data would be required. This lesson teaches you how to identify when "cannot be determined" is the correct answer, explains common scenarios where data is insufficient despite appearing complete, provides strategies for distinguishing between difficult-to-find information and genuinely missing information, and shows you how to avoid incorrectly selecting "cannot be determined" when the answer is actually present in the figures or passage.

1. Understanding When Information Is Genuinely Missing
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Cannot-be-determined scenarios</strong> occur when the data provided is <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">legitimately insufficient</strong> to answer the question, regardless of how carefully you analyze the figures or passage.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Scenario 1: Data Outside the Measured Range
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
The most common <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">cannot-be-determined scenario</strong> involves questions asking about values outside what was actually measured: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Example</strong>: A graph shows data from 0-100°C. Question asks: "What would the pressure be at 150°C?" Since 150°C is beyond the measured range and you don't know if the trend continues linearly, exponentially, or changes direction entirely, you cannot determine the answer from the given data. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Why it's undeterminable</strong>: Extrapolation beyond measured data requires assumptions about how trends continue, which may or may not be valid. Without additional information confirming the trend continues, you cannot definitively answer. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Key distinction</strong>: Questions asking for reasonable estimates within a small extension of the range may be answerable ("Based on the trend, which is most likely at 110°C?"), but questions far outside the range or asking for exact values beyond the data cannot be determined. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Red flags</strong>: Questions mentioning values clearly outside all measured ranges, asking about conditions not tested, or requesting information about experimental setups not described.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Scenario 2: Variables Not Measured or Reported
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Questions asking about <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">variables that weren't measured</strong> cannot be answered: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Example</strong>: Passage describes measuring temperature and pressure but doesn't mention volume. Question asks: "What was the volume at t=30 min?" Since volume was never measured or reported, you cannot determine it. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Subtle variations</strong>: Sometimes a variable is mentioned in the passage but data for it isn't provided in figures. The passage might say "Students also noted the color" but no figure shows color data. Questions about color cannot be answered. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Indirect measurement questions</strong>: "What was the pH?" when only temperature and pressure are graphed, and no formula or relationship is provided to calculate pH from those variables. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">How to verify</strong>: Check all figures and tables. If the variable mentioned in the question doesn't appear in any axis label, column header, or data row, it likely cannot be determined.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Scenario 3: Ambiguous or Unlabeled Data
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
When <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">data exists but isn't clearly identified</strong>, determination may be impossible: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Example</strong>: A graph shows three unlabeled lines. Passage mentions Trial 1, 2, and 3 but doesn't specify which line corresponds to which trial, and there's no way to deduce it from the data patterns. Question asks: "What was the temperature in Trial 2 at t=20?" You can't answer because you don't know which line is Trial 2. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Missing legends or keys</strong>: Symbols, colors, or abbreviations used in figures without explanation and not defined in the passage. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check carefully</strong>: Before concluding data is ambiguous, thoroughly check figure captions, legends, passage text, and pattern clues. Sometimes the identification is subtle but present. Only if truly no identification exists is it undeterminable. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ACT typically provides identifiable data</strong>, so this scenario is rarer than the others, but it's worth recognizing.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Scenario 4: Questions Requiring Unknown Intermediate Steps
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Some questions cannot be answered because they require <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">information or calculations for which necessary data is missing</strong>: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Example</strong>: Question asks "What was the density?" but the data only provides mass, not volume (and density = mass/volume). Without volume, you cannot calculate density. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Missing formulas or constants</strong>: "Calculate the energy" when energy formula isn't provided and data doesn't directly show energy values. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Missing conversion factors</strong>: Data in one unit, question asks for answer in different unit, but conversion factor isn't provided. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Important note</strong>: Basic scientific formulas and common conversions are sometimes assumed knowledge (like °F to °C conversion), but obscure or complex calculations requiring specific constants won't be required without data. If the question seems to require advanced calculations with missing components, "cannot be determined" is likely correct.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Genuinely Missing Information</strong><br><br>
<strong>Scenario 1 (Outside Range):</strong><br>
Data provided: Temperature measured from 0-100°C, pressure values from 1-5 atm<br>
Question: "What would pressure be at 200°C?"<br>
Analysis: 200°C is far outside the measured range (0-100°C)<br>
Conclusion: Cannot be determined—would require assumptions about trend continuation<br><br>
<strong>Scenario 2 (Variable Not Measured):</strong><br>
Data provided: Figure 1 shows temperature vs time, Figure 2 shows pressure vs time<br>
Question: "What was the volume at t=30 min?"<br>
Analysis: Volume never measured or reported anywhere in passage or figures<br>
Conclusion: Cannot be determined—volume data doesn't exist<br><br>
<strong>Scenario 3 (Ambiguous Data):</strong><br>
Data provided: Three unlabeled lines on a graph<br>
Passage: Mentions Trial A, B, C but doesn't specify which line is which<br>
Question: "What was the value for Trial B at t=20?"<br>
Analysis: Can't identify which line corresponds to Trial B<br>
Conclusion: Cannot be determined—line identification missing<br><br>
<strong>Scenario 4 (Missing Intermediate Data):</strong><br>
Data provided: Mass values for different samples<br>
Question: "What was the density of Sample 1?"<br>
Analysis: Density = mass/volume, but only mass is provided, not volume<br>
Conclusion: Cannot be determined—missing volume data needed for calculation

2. Distinguishing "Cannot Be Determined" from "Difficult to Find"
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
A critical skill is <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">distinguishing between information that's genuinely absent</strong> versus information that's present but requires careful search or analysis to find.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Before Selecting "Cannot Be Determined," Exhaust All Sources
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Before concluding information is missing, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">systematically check every possible source</strong>: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">All figures and tables</strong>: Check every graph, table, and diagram. The information might be in a figure you didn't initially think relevant. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Figure captions and notes</strong>: Read small print, footnotes, and captions carefully. Critical information is sometimes tucked in these locations. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Passage text</strong>: Scan the passage for keywords from the question. Information might be stated in text rather than shown in figures. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Answer choices</strong>: Sometimes answer choices provide clues. If three choices give specific values and one says "cannot be determined," check whether those specific values actually appear in the data. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Only after thoroughly checking all sources</strong> should you conclude the information is missing. Many students prematurely select "cannot be determined" when the information is actually present but requires more careful searching.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Information That Requires Integration or Calculation
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Some questions require <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">combining data from multiple sources</strong> or performing calculations—this doesn't mean it can't be determined: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Multi-figure integration</strong>: If Figure 1 shows temperature at different times and Figure 2 shows pressure at different times, you CAN determine temperature and pressure at the same time by cross-referencing—it's not "cannot be determined" just because you need both figures. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Simple calculations</strong>: If data provides initial and final values and the question asks for the change, you CAN calculate change by subtraction—this is determinable. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Using provided formulas</strong>: If the passage provides a formula and all variables in that formula have values in the data, you CAN calculate the result—it's determinable. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Don't confuse "complex" with "undeterminable."</strong> If the information exists (even if finding it requires multiple steps), it CAN be determined. Only select "cannot be determined" when data is genuinely absent, not when the solution is multi-step.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Information That Can Be Inferred or Deduced
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Sometimes information isn't directly stated but can be <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">reasonably inferred</strong>: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Pattern deduction</strong>: If Figure 1 shows that Trial 1 always has the highest values across all measurements, and the question asks which trial had the highest value at a specific point, you can infer Trial 1 even if that exact point isn't explicitly labeled. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Logical elimination</strong>: If the passage says three trials were run (A, B, C) and two are clearly identified in a figure, the unlabeled third line must be the remaining trial. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Interpolation</strong>: Values between measured points can be reasonably estimated by interpolation—this is determinable, not "cannot be determined." (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Boundary</strong>: Reasonable inference is acceptable. Wild speculation is not. If inference requires multiple assumptions or logical leaps, it may genuinely be undeterminable. But straightforward deductions from available data don't qualify as "cannot be determined."
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Common Student Errors Leading to False "Cannot Be Determined"
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Students sometimes <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">incorrectly select "cannot be determined"</strong> when: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">They didn't search carefully enough</strong>. The information is present but in a different figure or in passage text, not where they expected. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">They gave up too quickly</strong>. The question is challenging or requires multiple steps, so they assume it's unanswerable rather than working through it. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">They confused unfamiliarity with impossibility</strong>. The question asks about a concept or variable they don't understand, so they think it can't be answered, when actually the data is there. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">They misread what's being asked</strong>. They looked for the wrong variable or checked the wrong conditions. To avoid these errors: Always do a thorough, systematic search before selecting "cannot be determined." Treat it as a last resort, not a first response to difficulty. If you're considering "cannot be determined," ask yourself: "Have I checked every figure? Every table? The passage text? Figure captions?" Only if the answer is yes and you still haven't found the information should you select it.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Distinguishing Difficult from Impossible</strong><br><br>
<strong>Difficult but CAN Be Determined:</strong><br>
Question: "What was the temperature when pressure was 2.5 atm?"<br>
Figure 1: Shows temperature vs time<br>
Figure 2: Shows pressure vs time<br>
Process: Find t when P=2.5 atm in Figure 2 (say t=25 min), then find temperature at t=25 in Figure 1<br>
Conclusion: CAN be determined—requires two-figure integration but data exists<br><br>
<strong>Appears Difficult but CAN Be Determined:</strong><br>
Question: "What was the increase in volume from t=10 to t=30?"<br>
Table shows: V=20 mL at t=10, V=45 mL at t=30<br>
Process: Calculate 45-20=25 mL<br>
Conclusion: CAN be determined—simple calculation from available data<br><br>
<strong>Actually CANNOT Be Determined:</strong><br>
Question: "What was the pH at t=30 min?"<br>
Figures show: Temperature vs time, pressure vs time<br>
Passage: Never mentions pH or provides any relationship between pH and the measured variables<br>
Process: Check all figures—pH not shown. Check passage—pH not mentioned. No way to derive it.<br>
Conclusion: CANNOT be determined—pH data genuinely absent<br><br>
The key difference: In the first two, all necessary data exists and can be found or calculated. In the third, the data simply doesn't exist anywhere.

3. Strategic Approaches for "Cannot Be Determined" Questions
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Systematic strategies</strong> help you accurately identify when "cannot be determined" is correct versus when the answer is present but challenging to find.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
The Systematic Elimination Checklist
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
When facing a question where you're struggling to find information, use this <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">checklist</strong>: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Identify exactly what the question asks</strong>. What variable? At what condition? (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check Figure 1</strong>: Does it show this variable or provide data to calculate it? (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check Figure 2, Figure 3, etc.</strong>: Systematically check each figure. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check any tables</strong>: Look for the variable in column or row headers. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Read passage text</strong>: Scan for keywords related to the question. The information might be stated in words rather than shown in data. (6) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check if it can be calculated</strong>: Do you have all components needed for a calculation or formula? (7) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check if it can be inferred</strong>: Can you deduce it from patterns or elimination? (8) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Only if all checks fail</strong>, select "cannot be determined." This systematic approach ensures you don't miss information that's present but not where you expected.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Recognizing "Cannot Be Determined" Answer Choice Patterns
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ACT answer choices provide clues</strong>: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">If three choices are specific values</strong> (20, 40, 60) and one is "cannot be determined," check whether those specific values actually appear in or can be derived from the data. If they can, "cannot be determined" is likely wrong. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">If "cannot be determined" is an option</strong>, the question is testing whether you recognize data limitations. Be extra careful to verify whether information is truly missing. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ACT doesn't frequently use "cannot be determined"</strong> as correct answers—most questions are designed to be answerable from the data. Don't assume it's correct just because a question seems hard. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">When it IS correct</strong>, it's usually clearly correct—the data is obviously missing, not subtly absent. If you're debating whether information is available, it probably is available and you just haven't found it yet. Use the presence of "cannot be determined" as a signal to search extra carefully, not as an easy way out of a difficult question.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Time Management Strategy for These Questions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Balance thoroughness with efficiency</strong>: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Spend 30-45 seconds searching</strong> before considering "cannot be determined." Check all major sources systematically. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">If after thorough search you haven't found the information</strong>, assess whether the data genuinely seems missing. If the variable isn't in any figure, isn't mentioned in the passage, and doesn't appear derivable, it probably is undeterminable. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Don't waste 2+ minutes</strong> desperately searching for information that may not exist. If systematic searching for 45 seconds reveals no information and the data genuinely appears absent, select "cannot be determined" and move on. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Mark for review if unsure</strong>. If you're truly uncertain whether information is missing or just hard to find, mark the question and return to it if time permits. Fresh eyes on the second pass might spot information you missed initially. Balance between thoroughness (don't give up too easily) and efficiency (don't waste excessive time on a question designed to test recognition of missing data).
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Practicing Recognition of Data Limitations
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Developing skill with these questions requires <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">practice recognizing limitations</strong>: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">When reviewing practice passages</strong>, after answering normal questions, ask yourself: "What questions COULDN'T be answered from this data? What variables weren't measured? What ranges weren't covered?" (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Develop awareness of data boundaries</strong>: What's the minimum and maximum x-value? What variables are shown versus not shown? What relationships are demonstrated versus assumed? (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Compare passages that provide complete data versus those with gaps</strong>. Notice the difference between comprehensive experiments and limited studies. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Build confidence</strong> in distinguishing "I can't find it" from "it's not there." This skill improves with practice and reduces anxiety when encountering these questions on test day. The goal is developing intuition for what data supports and what it doesn't.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Strategic Approach</strong><br><br>
<strong>Question:</strong> "What was the conductivity of Solution A at 50°C?"<br><br>
<strong>Systematic Checklist:</strong><br>
✓ Figure 1: Shows temperature vs volume for Solutions A, B, C → No conductivity<br>
✓ Figure 2: Shows pH vs time for Solutions A, B, C → No conductivity<br>
✓ Table 1: Shows initial concentrations of A, B, C → No conductivity<br>
✓ Passage text: Scan for "conductivity" → Not mentioned anywhere<br>
✓ Can it be calculated? No formula relating conductivity to measured variables<br>
✓ Can it be inferred? No patterns or relationships suggest conductivity values<br><br>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> After systematic check, conductivity was never measured or discussed<br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> Cannot be determined<br>
<strong>Time spent:</strong> 40 seconds (efficient, systematic search)<br><br>
<strong>Contrast with:</strong><br>
Question: "What was the volume of Solution A at 50°C?"<br>
Systematic check: Figure 1 shows temperature vs volume → Find 50°C on x-axis, trace to Solution A line, read volume from y-axis → CAN be determined<br><br>
The difference: Volume data exists and is findable. Conductivity data genuinely doesn't exist anywhere. Systematic checking reveals which scenario applies.

4. Common Traps and Advanced Considerations
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Understanding subtle traps</strong> and advanced scenarios helps you navigate these questions with greater accuracy and confidence.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Trap #1: Confusing "Not Directly Shown" with "Cannot Be Determined"
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Many students think if information isn't <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">directly visible in a single figure</strong>, it cannot be determined: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Example trap</strong>: "What was the ratio of Variable A to Variable B at t=20?" Figure 1 shows Variable A, Figure 2 shows Variable B. Students think "I don't see a ratio anywhere" and select "cannot be determined." But you CAN determine it by reading A from Figure 1, reading B from Figure 2, and calculating A/B. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Avoiding the trap</strong>: If all components needed for an answer are available (even if in different places or requiring calculation), it CAN be determined. Only select "cannot be determined" if one or more necessary components are truly absent. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Mental shift</strong>: Think of data as building blocks. If you have all the blocks needed to construct the answer (even if assembly required), it's determinable. Only if a block is missing is it undeterminable. Don't confuse "requires work" with "impossible."

Trap #2: Assuming Extrapolation Equals "Cannot Be Determined"
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Not all extrapolation is undeterminable</strong>: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Small, reasonable extrapolation</strong>: If data goes from 0-100 and the question asks about 110 "based on the trend," you can reasonably extend the line slightly and estimate. This is determinable as an approximation. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Large or extreme extrapolation</strong>: If data goes from 0-100 and the question asks about 500, this is too far beyond the measured range for reasonable prediction. This likely cannot be determined. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Question wording matters</strong>: "Based on the trend, which value would most likely..." suggests approximation is acceptable (determinable). "What exactly would the value be..." for far extrapolation suggests impossibility (cannot be determined). (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Use judgment</strong>: Small extensions of clear trends with "most likely" language are usually determinable. Large extensions or questions asking for precision beyond the data range are usually undeterminable. Context and question wording guide which applies.

Advanced Scenario: Partial Information That's Insufficient
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Sometimes <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">some information is present but not enough</strong>: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Example</strong>: Question asks "What was the final temperature of the mixture?" Passage says two liquids were mixed, one at 20°C and one at 40°C, but doesn't provide volumes, masses, or heat capacities. You know initial temperatures but can't calculate final temperature without additional data. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Another example</strong>: Data shows several data points, but the question asks which mathematical model (linear, exponential, logarithmic) best fits, yet not enough data points are provided to distinguish between models statistically. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Recognition</strong>: You have some relevant information but not all necessary information. It's tempting to guess or make assumptions, but if key data is missing, it cannot be determined. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Test skill</strong>: These scenarios test whether you recognize what information is sufficient versus insufficient for answering a question.

When to Trust Your Instinct vs. Keep Searching
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Developing <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">good judgment</strong> about when to conclude "cannot be determined": (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Trust your instinct if</strong>: After systematic searching, the variable isn't mentioned anywhere, isn't in any figure axis or table header, and you've checked all sources thoroughly. If it's obviously absent, trust that assessment. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Keep searching if</strong>: The question seems very straightforward for a passage that otherwise provides detailed data. If the passage is comprehensive and only this one piece seems missing, double-check—it might be there in an unexpected location. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Context clues</strong>: If the passage is clearly incomplete or limited (described as a "preliminary study" or "partial data"), missing information is more likely. If the passage describes a thorough experiment, comprehensive data is more likely. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Balance</strong>: Don't be so determined to find information that you waste time searching for data that truly isn't there. But also don't give up so easily that you select "cannot be determined" when the information is present but requires effort to find. Experience and practice develop this balanced judgment.

<strong>Example: Avoiding Traps</strong><br><br>
<strong>Trap 1 - "Not Directly Shown" ≠ "Cannot Be Determined":</strong><br>
Question: "What was the change in temperature from t=10 to t=30?"<br>
Student thinking: "I don't see 'change' anywhere in the figures"<br>
Wrong: Selects "cannot be determined"<br>
Correct approach: Figure shows T=45°C at t=10, T=70°C at t=30<br>
Calculate: 70-45=25°C change<br>
Answer: 25°C (CAN be determined through simple calculation)<br><br>
<strong>Trap 2 - Extrapolation:</strong><br>
Data range: 0-100°C<br>
Question 1: "Based on the trend, which value would most likely occur at 110°C: 15, 20, 25, 30?"<br>
Answer: Determinable—small extrapolation with "most likely" language and answer choices to guide<br>
Question 2: "What would the exact value be at 500°C?"<br>
Answer: Cannot be determined—far outside range, asking for exact value<br><br>
<strong>Partial Information:</strong><br>
Question: "What was the density of the mixture?"<br>
Data provided: Mass of component A, mass of component B<br>
Data missing: Volumes (density = mass/volume)<br>
Analysis: Have masses but not volumes needed for density calculation<br>
Answer: Cannot be determined—insufficient data for required calculation<br><br>
These examples show the nuances between genuinely missing data and data that requires some work to find or derive.
