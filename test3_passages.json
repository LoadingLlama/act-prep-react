    "passage_text": "It’s winter, and the sun’s rays no longer shine directly on<u id=\"q1\">Rjukan, </u> a small town in south-central Norway. While all of Norway has precious few sunlit hours in winter, Rjukan is tucked in a valley between two mountain ridges that completely block sunlight from late September to mid-March. Yet despite the mountains, an oval of afternoon sunlight bathes the market square, thanks to the SolspeiI—“sun mirror.”\r\n\r\nAfter moving to Rjukan in 2001, <u id=\"q2\">the prolonged winter gloom alarmed artist Martin Andersen.</u>He wondered if mirrors placed on one of the ridges above Rjukan could <u id=\"q3\">change the situation.</u> \r\n\r\nHe learned that in 1913 local bookkeeper Oscar Kittelsen had proposed erecting mirrors for the same purpose, <u id=\"q4\"> and instead </u> Sam Eyde, the town’s founder, had considered the idea. However, Eyde <u id=\"q5\"> did not follow through on construction of the mirrors, and he abandoned the idea.</u>\r\n\r\nOne hundred years later, Andersen made the mirrors <u id=\"q6\"> a reality. Three </u> 550-square-foot mirrors were airlifted to the top of a ridge 1,475 feet above Rjukan. Helicopters carried the heavy equipment up the <u id=\"q7\"> mountain, moreover,</u> no roads led to the cliffside construction cite. Since a crane would have been too heavy for helicopters to lift, workers used <u id=\"q9\"> tools such as thirty-foot wooden tripods </u> to install the mirrors.\r\n\r\nThe three mirrors <u id=\"q10\"> team up as a group </u> to create a bright 2,000-square-foot ellipse of light in the town square. <u id=\"q11\"> To keep the light on the square,</u> the mirrors adjust every ten seconds, tracking the sun as it crosses the sky.\r\n\r\nThey're controlled wirelessly by a company in <u id=\"q12\">Germany, and monitored, in Rjukan and </u> on the mountain via webcamThe light rays that  <u id=\"q13\">reaches the town is</u> between 80 and 100 percent as strong as direct sunlight. \r\n\r\nIn October 2013, residents rejoiced <u id=\"q14\">due to the bright light when the Solspeil </u> first shone a bright beam of sunlight into Rjukan. Locals wore sunglasses and lay on deck chairs to soak up the rays. Said one, “Who’d have thought it? I’ve stepped out to get a bit of sun.”",

[B] Between the fifth and twelfth centuries, this tradition was upheld by <i>scops,</i> professional poets who sang or recited poetry at ceremonies.\r\n\r\n[C] In the Middle Ages, however, the ability to write wasn’t common, even among royalty. Narratives such as the heroic epic <i>Beowulf</i> and the mournful poem <i>The Seafarer</i> <u id=\"q16\">has been </u> passed on <u id=\"q17\">by people being conversant</u> for centuries. \r\n\r\n[D] The position of scop required not only great memorization skills <u id=\"q18\">(something that could be honed over time) </u> but also the ability to compose epic works <u id=\"q19\">at an elevated, consistent level of frequency</u> Scops became the keepersScops became the keepers of poems, <u id=\"q20\">songs were written,</u> and even the histories of their people.\r\n\r\n\r\nSkilled scops were valued <u id=\"q21\">as</u> highly in Anglo-Saxon society rewards for their talents. There are, <u id=\"q22\">generally,</u> several records of royals giving land to deserving <u id=\"q23\">scops </u>.\r\n\r\n\r\nCoins or gold rings <u id=\"q24\">these could be quite useful</u> —were common gifts for scops <u id=\"q25\">which </u> did well. \r\n\r\nTo achieve this kind of success. a scop needed to transcend being just an entertainer in a mead hall.<u id=\"q26\">  </u> While mindful of the expectation that they would glorify their leaders, scops set standards for morality through their celebration of heroes and condemnation of villains. Therefore, a person’s reputation could rise or fall by the scop’s hand. Additionally, scops preserved and conveyed <u id=\"q27\">through</u> history from one generation to the <u id=\"q28\">next. To provide</u> a type of immortality traditionally revered by the Anglo-Saxons. More than a storyteller, the scop was a historian, teacher, and messenger of community values. The scop’s call of “Hwaet!” was an invitation to audiences to gather and celebrate their culture. ",

He’s a teacher, but in the summer he salvages sunken logs from lakes and sells them. So one <u id=\"q32\">morning as we walked to the dock to ready</u> the pontoon, a versatile type of boat that’s essentially a platform atop two hollow metal flotation cylinders.\r\n\r\nAfter a chilly ride across Moosehead Lake, we reached a bay that Uncle Lee had tagged on his GPS. He activated the boat’s <u id=\"q33\">sonar, and piloted</u> slowly forward as we watched a monitor. Soon, ghostly images appeared on the screen, <u id=\"q34\">showing </u> what looked like a <u id=\"q35\">collection</u> of matchsticks on the lake bottom. They weren’t matchsticks, of course, but sunken logs. \r\n\r\nFor centuries, Maine loggers sent their harvests to market by floating them down rivers. When the logs reached Moosehead Lake, they were bound together and towed to lakeside sawmills. Each year, some of the logs sank. In the deep water, <u id=\"q36\">protected from insects and oxygen,</u> the wood remained well preserved.\r\n\r\nOn the boat, another monitor displayed <u id=\"q37\">and showed the underwater video camera’s view:</u> the boat’s grapple arm reaching for a log <u id=\"q38\">that Uncle Lee thought </u> was birch. The arm’s iron pinchers grasped the log, coaxed it from beneath another log, and, aided by a winch, <u id=\"q39\">they pull </u> it from the depths. When the log surfaced, it looked like <u id=\"q40\">a gunked-up, mega-big</u> telephone pole.\r\n\r\nAs my uncle lashed the log to the boat, he pointed out the axe marks on the wood. Because it was felled by an <u id=\"q41\">axe he explained</u> the tree was probably cut in the mid-nineteenth century. \r\n\r\nAdd to that <u id=\"q42\">when it was cut</u> the age of the tree—easily two hundred years and we were looking at a birch that <u id=\"q43\"> had seen centuries come and centuries go</u> By the end of the day, <u id=\"q44\">I'd gotten pretty good at</u> operating the grapple arm, and we had nine logs tied to the boat. <u id=\"q45\">Uncle Lee said that one day last year he hauled out twenty logs, but some days he’d leave the lake without finding a single salvageable log.</u>",

    "passage_text": "Stax Records of Memphis, Tennessee,<u id=\"q61\">maybe less renowned than</u> Detroit's Motown, but its contributions to 1960s American soul music <u id=\"q62\">has been no</u> less significant. The southern soul coming out of <u id=\"q63\">Stax had</u> a grittier, funkier sound than Motown's, blending elements of country, gospel, and rhythm & blues. [A] But beyond genre, it was the people, their methods, and even the building itself (which had once been a movie theater) that made Stax one of the most exceptional recording studios of the era.\r\n\r\nStax’s unlikely founders, siblings Jim Stewart and Estelle Axton, were bankers <u id=\"q64\">themselves whom </u> loved music. <u id=\"q65\">They knew </u> little about the music industry or soul, but they had open minds and <u id=\"q66\">collected </u> collaboration. Their open-door policy allowed unestablished or unconventional artists <u id=\"q67\">(often ignored by bigger studios)</u> to make their names at Stax.\r\n\r\n[B] Booker T. Jones, Carla Thomas, and Otis Redding <u id=\"q68\">who recorded hits there.</u> \r\n\r\nThat conversation included a range of perspectives rarely found at other studios. Despite the pervasive segregation of Memphis in the <u id=\"q69\">1960s, when </u> the Stax staff and house band were fully integrated, The “Stax family” also included people of various ages and economic backgrounds, all <u id=\"q70\">were contributing</u> to Stax’s unique sound. [C] \r\n\r\nAnother distinction was one of method. At most <u id=\"q71\">studios, performers worked, from</u> previously arranged sheet music. <u id=\"q72\">For example,</u> Stax musicians spontaneously composed music together, a practice called <i> head arranging.</i> Otis Redding might walk in and sing a few lyrics to the band. The other musicians would riff on his idea until a complete song emerged <u id=\"q73\">between</u> the collaboration. Then, they’d record the song without ever putting the notes on paper.\r\n\r\nEven the <u id=\"q74\">building, for instance,</u> helped to create the Stax sound. Recording equipment in the 1960s was rudimentary by today’s standards. [D] But the former theater’s sloped floor and bass-heavy movie speakers gave recordings a deep, raw tone so distinctive that aficionados can often recognize a Stax song within the first few notes.\r\n",
