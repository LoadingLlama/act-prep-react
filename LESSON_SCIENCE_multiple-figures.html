Multiple figures questions require you to <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">synthesize information</strong> from two or more different figures, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">compare data across tables and graphs</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">identify relationships between variables</strong> shown in separate visualizations, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">integrate data from multiple sources</strong> to answer complex questions. Unlike single-figure questions that test your ability to read one graph or table, multiple figures questions assess your capacity to navigate between different representations, track variables across formats, combine numerical data with visual trends, and draw conclusions that require information from more than one source. This lesson teaches you systematic approaches for handling questions that reference multiple figures, explains how to efficiently move between figures without losing track of information, provides strategies for identifying which figures contain the data you need, and shows you how to organize multi-figure information to answer questions accurately and quickly.

1. Recognizing and Approaching Multiple Figures Questions
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Multiple figures questions</strong> explicitly or implicitly require data from <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">two or more separate figures</strong>. These questions test your ability to integrate information across different data presentations and understand relationships between variables shown separately.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Identifying Multiple Figures Questions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Multiple figures questions can be <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">explicitly stated</strong> or <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">implicitly required</strong>. Explicit questions include clear references: "Based on Figures 1 and 2, which statement is correct?", "According to Table 1 and Graph 1, at which temperature...", or "Using data from both Figure 1 and Figure 3...". These questions tell you directly that you need multiple sources. Implicit questions require multiple figures even though they don't explicitly say so: "At what pH was oxygen concentration highest?" might seem like a single-figure question, but if pH data is in Table 1 and oxygen concentration is in Figure 2, you need both. To identify implicit multiple-figure questions: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Read the question carefully</strong> and identify what variables or data points are mentioned. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check which figures contain each piece of information</strong>. If different variables are in different figures, you'll need both. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Look for connecting variables</strong> that appear in multiple figures—these are often the key to linking data across sources. Understanding whether a question requires one or multiple figures prevents you from wasting time searching for data that doesn't exist in a single source.

The Two-Pass Reading Strategy for Complex Passages
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
When a passage contains <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">three or more figures</strong>, use a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">two-pass reading strategy</strong> to build mental organization: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Pass 1 (Initial overview, 30-45 seconds):</strong> (1) Read the passage introduction to understand the general experiment or topic. (2) Quickly note how many figures there are and what type each is (table, line graph, bar graph, diagram, etc.). (3) For each figure, read only the title and axis labels to understand what variables are shown. (4) Identify any connecting variables that appear in multiple figures (for example, "temperature" might be shown in both Figure 1 and Figure 2). <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Pass 2 (Question-driven detail reading):</strong> (5) Read each question and identify which figure(s) it requires. (6) Return to those specific figures and examine them in detail only when needed to answer the question. This two-pass strategy prevents information overload. Rather than trying to memorize all data from all figures upfront, you build a mental map of where information lives, then retrieve it on-demand. This is much more efficient than studying every figure in detail before seeing the questions, and it prevents confusion between similar data in different figures.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Creating a Mental Map of Figure Organization
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
As you examine multiple figures, build a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">mental map</strong> of what information each figure contains. This mental organization helps you quickly locate needed data during questions. To build your map: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Associate each figure with its primary variables</strong>. For example: "Figure 1 = temperature vs. pressure", "Figure 2 = temperature vs. volume", "Table 1 = gas composition". (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Note which variables appear in multiple places</strong>. If temperature appears in both Figure 1 and Figure 2, you know temperature is a connecting variable that links these figures. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Identify the independent variable (x-axis) for each figure</strong>. This helps you understand what's being manipulated versus what's being measured. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Recognize the format of each figure</strong>—tables are good for exact values, line graphs show trends, scatter plots show relationships. This mental organization means that when you encounter a question like "At what temperature was volume highest?", you immediately think "temperature and volume = Figure 2" rather than randomly searching through all figures.

Understanding Common Multi-Figure Relationships
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
ACT Science passages use multiple figures in <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">predictable patterns</strong>: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Different experiments or trials</strong>: Figure 1 shows Experiment 1 results, Figure 2 shows Experiment 2 results, etc. Questions ask you to compare across experiments. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Same variables, different formats</strong>: Table 1 shows numerical data, Figure 1 graphs the same data visually. Questions test whether you can use whichever format is more helpful. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Linked variables</strong>: Figure 1 shows how X affects Y, Figure 2 shows how Y affects Z. Questions ask about the relationship between X and Z (requiring you to connect through Y). (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Different conditions</strong>: Figure 1 shows data at pH 5, Figure 2 shows data at pH 7. Questions ask you to compare results under different conditions. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Complementary information</strong>: Table 1 provides initial conditions, Figure 1 shows results. Both are needed to answer questions about how changes in initial conditions affect outcomes. Recognizing these patterns helps you anticipate what types of questions might be asked and how figures will work together.

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Building a Mental Map</strong><br><br>
<strong>Passage contains:</strong><br>
- Figure 1: Line graph, x-axis = time (0-60 min), y-axis = temperature (0-100°C)<br>
- Figure 2: Line graph, x-axis = time (0-60 min), y-axis = pressure (0-5 atm)<br>
- Table 1: Shows gas composition (% nitrogen, % oxygen, % CO₂) at time 0, 30, and 60 min<br><br>
<strong>Mental Map:</strong><br>
- "Time" appears in all three → connecting variable<br>
- Figure 1 = temperature over time<br>
- Figure 2 = pressure over time<br>
- Table 1 = gas composition at specific times<br>
- If question asks about temperature AND pressure → need both Figures 1 and 2<br>
- If question asks about composition at a certain temperature → need Table 1 (for composition) and Figure 1 (to find when that temperature occurred)<br><br>
This map allows instant navigation to the right data source(s).

2. Strategies for Navigating Between Multiple Figures
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Efficient navigation</strong> between figures is critical for speed and accuracy. Without a systematic approach, you can waste significant time flipping back and forth, lose track of which data came from which figure, or miss connections between sources.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
The Question-First Navigation Method
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
For multiple figures questions, always use a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">question-first approach</strong>: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Read the question completely</strong> before looking at any figures. Understand exactly what's being asked. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Identify which variables or data the question mentions</strong>. For example, if the question asks "At what pH was enzyme activity highest?", you need pH and enzyme activity. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Determine which figure(s) contain those variables</strong> using your mental map. If pH is in Table 1 and enzyme activity is in Figure 2, you need both. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Go to the first figure</strong> and extract the needed information. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Go to the second figure</strong> and extract its information. (6) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Synthesize the data</strong> from both sources to answer the question. This method prevents you from randomly looking through figures hoping to stumble upon the answer. Instead, you purposefully navigate to exactly what you need.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Using Connecting Variables as Bridges
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Connecting variables</strong> that appear in multiple figures serve as <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">bridges</strong> for integrating data. The most common connecting variable is the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">independent variable</strong> (often time, temperature, concentration, etc.) that appears on the x-axis of multiple graphs or as a column in multiple tables. To use connecting variables: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Find the value of the connecting variable</strong> specified in the question or that satisfies the condition you're looking for. For example, if the question asks about "temperature = 50°C", locate 50°C. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">In the first figure</strong>, find what happens at that connecting variable value. At 50°C in Figure 1, pressure = 2 atm. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Use that same connecting variable value in the second figure</strong>. At 50°C in Figure 2, volume = 45 mL. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Now you have data from both figures at the same condition</strong>, allowing you to compare or combine them. The connecting variable ensures you're comparing apples to apples—data from the same experimental conditions, time points, or parameter values.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
The Sticky Note Tracking Method for Complex Questions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
For particularly complex multiple-figure questions, use a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">tracking system</strong> to avoid losing track of information: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">As you extract data from the first figure, jot down the value</strong> in the margin next to that figure or on scratch paper. For example, write "50°C → P = 2 atm". (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Move to the second figure</strong> and find the corresponding data. Write "50°C → V = 45 mL". (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">If a third figure is needed</strong>, continue the same process. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Now you have all the data in one place</strong> (your notes) and can answer the question without needing to flip back and forth repeatedly. This method is especially valuable for questions like "At which temperature were BOTH pressure greater than 2 atm AND volume less than 50 mL?" where you need to check multiple conditions across multiple figures. Writing down intermediate findings prevents you from forgetting what you found in the first figure by the time you check the second.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Efficient Physical Navigation on the Test Page
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Physical navigation</strong> on paper matters for efficiency: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">When figures are on different pages</strong>, use one finger to hold your place on one page while flipping to the other, or fold the test booklet so both pages are visible simultaneously. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Read figure labels carefully each time you switch</strong> to ensure you're looking at the right figure. It's easy to confuse Figure 2 with Figure 3 when switching rapidly. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Use a finger or pencil to track your position</strong> on each figure—point to the exact data point you're reading to prevent losing your place. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Minimize the number of switches</strong>. If you need to check four conditions across two figures, extract all four values from Figure 1 first (writing them down), then extract all four from Figure 2, rather than switching back and forth four separate times. These physical strategies might seem minor, but they can save 10-15 seconds per question, which adds up significantly over a full passage.
</p>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #3b82f6; padding: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Using a Connecting Variable</strong><br><br>
<strong>Question:</strong> "At what time were both temperature greater than 60°C AND pressure less than 3 atm?"<br><br>
<strong>Step 1:</strong> Identify needed data → temperature and pressure<br>
<strong>Step 2:</strong> Identify sources → Figure 1 (temperature vs time), Figure 2 (pressure vs time)<br>
<strong>Step 3:</strong> Identify connecting variable → time (appears in both)<br><br>
<strong>Method:</strong><br>
- Check answer choices: 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, 40 min<br>
- For each time option, check BOTH figures:<br>
  - At t=10: Figure 1 → T=50°C (NO, need >60°C) → Eliminate<br>
  - At t=20: Figure 1 → T=65°C (YES), Figure 2 → P=4 atm (NO, need <3 atm) → Eliminate<br>
  - At t=30: Figure 1 → T=70°C (YES), Figure 2 → P=2.5 atm (YES) → This works!<br>
  - At t=40: Check if needed, but t=30 already satisfies both conditions<br><br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> 30 min<br><br>
The connecting variable (time) allowed systematic checking across both figures.

3. Common Types of Multiple Figures Questions
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Multiple figures questions fall into <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">predictable categories</strong>. Understanding these common question types helps you recognize what approach to use and what kind of information synthesis is required.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Type 1: Direct Comparison Questions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Direct comparison questions</strong> ask you to compare values or trends from different figures: "Was temperature higher in Experiment 1 or Experiment 2 at time = 30 min?", "In which trial was reaction rate fastest?", or "Which figure shows the greatest increase in pressure?" To answer these: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Identify the comparison criterion</strong>—what specifically are you comparing? (temperature, rate of change, maximum value, etc.). (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Extract the relevant value from each figure</strong>. If comparing at t=30 min, find the value at t=30 in Figure 1, then in Figure 2. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Make the comparison</strong>. Which is higher? Lower? Faster? (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Select the answer</strong> that matches your comparison. These questions test your ability to locate equivalent data points across different sources and make simple comparisons. The key is ensuring you're comparing the same conditions—if comparing at t=30 min, make sure you're looking at t=30 in all relevant figures.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Type 2: Condition-Matching Questions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Condition-matching questions</strong> ask you to find when multiple conditions are simultaneously satisfied: "At what temperature were BOTH pH greater than 6 AND enzyme activity greater than 50%?", or "Which trial had a concentration less than 0.5 M AND a reaction time greater than 40 seconds?" To solve these: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Identify all conditions that must be met</strong>. Break down "BOTH X and Y" into two separate requirements. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check answer choices systematically</strong>. For each option, verify whether it satisfies ALL conditions. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Use elimination</strong>. If an option fails even one condition, eliminate it immediately and move to the next. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">The correct answer must satisfy every condition</strong>. These questions require careful tracking because you might find that Option A satisfies condition 1 but not condition 2, while Option B satisfies condition 2 but not condition 1—you need to find the option that works for both.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Type 3: Chained Relationship Questions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Chained relationship questions</strong> require you to trace through multiple figures to connect variables: "Based on the figures, how does increasing pressure affect volume?" when Figure 1 shows temperature vs. pressure and Figure 2 shows temperature vs. volume (requiring you to connect through temperature). To handle these: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Identify the chain</strong>. What's the starting variable, intermediate variable, and ending variable? (Pressure → Temperature → Volume). (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Trace the first relationship</strong>. In Figure 1, as pressure increases, what happens to temperature? (Temperature increases). (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Trace the second relationship</strong>. In Figure 2, as temperature increases, what happens to volume? (Volume increases). (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Chain them together</strong>. Pressure increases → Temperature increases → Volume increases. Therefore, increasing pressure increases volume (through the intermediate effect on temperature). These questions test your understanding of how multiple variables interact across different experimental setups or conditions.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Type 4: Data Integration Questions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Data integration questions</strong> require you to combine numerical values from multiple figures to calculate or determine something new: "If temperature was 50°C and pressure was 2 atm, what was the density according to Table 1?" when Figure 1 provides temperature-pressure relationships and Table 1 provides density at various temperature-pressure combinations. To solve these: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Extract each piece of needed data</strong> from its respective figure. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Combine the data according to the question's requirements</strong>. This might involve looking up a combination of conditions, calculating a ratio, or finding where multiple values intersect. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check that your integrated answer makes sense</strong>. If combining data from temperature and pressure to get density, does the density value seem reasonable given the conditions? These questions often involve using one figure to determine a value, then using that value to look up information in another figure, requiring two-step navigation.

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Question Types in Action</strong><br><br>
<strong>Type 1 (Direct Comparison):</strong><br>
Question: "At t=20 min, was temperature higher in Trial 1 or Trial 2?"<br>
Method: Check Figure 1 (Trial 1) at t=20 → T=45°C; Check Figure 2 (Trial 2) at t=20 → T=60°C<br>
Answer: Trial 2<br><br>
<strong>Type 2 (Condition-Matching):</strong><br>
Question: "At what time were both temperature > 50°C AND pressure < 2.5 atm?"<br>
Method: Check each time in answer choices against both conditions in both figures<br>
Answer: The time where BOTH conditions are true<br><br>
<strong>Type 3 (Chained Relationship):</strong><br>
Question: "How does increasing pH affect oxygen production?"<br>
Figure 1 shows: pH vs enzyme activity (pH↑ → activity↑)<br>
Figure 2 shows: enzyme activity vs oxygen production (activity↑ → O₂↑)<br>
Chain: pH↑ → activity↑ → O₂↑<br>
Answer: Increasing pH increases oxygen production<br><br>
<strong>Type 4 (Data Integration):</strong><br>
Question: "At pH 6, what was the ratio of enzyme A activity to enzyme B activity?"<br>
Figure 1: At pH 6, enzyme A activity = 40 units<br>
Figure 2: At pH 6, enzyme B activity = 20 units<br>
Integration: 40/20 = 2<br>
Answer: 2:1 ratio

Sometimes <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">answer choices reveal which figures you need</strong>: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check what units or variables appear in answer choices</strong>. If answers are in units of "mL", you know you need the figure that shows volume in mL. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Look at the range of answer values</strong>. If answers range from 20-50, find the figure whose scale includes these values. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Notice if answers refer to specific conditions</strong> ("Trial 1", "Experiment 2", "pH 6", etc.), which tells you exactly which figure or subset of data to examine. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Use elimination strategically</strong>. If you can't find a value that matches an answer choice in any figure, that answer is likely wrong and can be eliminated. This strategic use of answer choices prevents you from wasting time examining irrelevant figures or sections of data.

Pitfall #1: Confusing Similar Figures or Variables
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
When passages contain <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">similar-looking figures</strong> (multiple line graphs with similar shapes, or multiple tables with similar layouts), it's easy to confuse them and pull data from the wrong source. To prevent this: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Always verify the figure label</strong> before extracting data. Read "Figure 1" or "Figure 2" explicitly each time. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check axis labels or column headers</strong> to confirm you're reading the right variable. If you need "enzyme A" but you're looking at "enzyme B" data, you'll get the wrong answer. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Use distinct mental labels</strong> for each figure based on content, not just number. Think "the temperature graph" versus "the pressure graph" rather than just "Figure 1" and "Figure 2". (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">When switching between figures, re-orient yourself</strong> each time by quickly re-reading the title or axes. This pitfall is particularly common under time pressure when you're rushing between sources.

Pitfall #2: Missing the Connecting Variable
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Sometimes students <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">fail to recognize the connecting variable</strong> that links multiple figures, leading to incorrect data matching. For example, if Figure 1 shows trials labeled A, B, C and Figure 2 shows trials labeled 1, 2, 3, you need to find the passage text or table that explains which letter corresponds to which number. To avoid this: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Read all figure captions and notes carefully</strong> for information about how figures relate. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Look for common variables in axes, column headers, or labels</strong>. If both figures show "temperature", that's likely your connecting variable. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check the passage introduction</strong> for explanations of how experiments or trials are organized. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Ensure you're matching conditions correctly</strong>. If comparing Trial A in Figure 1 to Trial 2 in Figure 2, verify these are actually the same trial or are meant to be compared. Missing or misidentifying the connecting variable causes you to compare data from incompatible conditions.

Pitfall #3: Forgetting to Check All Conditions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
For condition-matching questions with <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">multiple requirements</strong>, students sometimes find an option that satisfies one condition and select it without checking the other conditions. To avoid this: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Write down all conditions explicitly</strong> before starting. If the question asks for "temperature > 50°C AND pressure < 3 atm", write "T > 50" and "P < 3". (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check each answer choice against every condition</strong>. Don't stop at the first condition. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Use a systematic elimination process</strong>. For each option, check condition 1 (if it fails, eliminate and move on; if it passes, check condition 2; etc.). (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Only select an answer after confirming it satisfies ALL conditions</strong>. Be especially careful with questions containing "both", "all", "and"—these signal multiple requirements. Students who rush often select the first option that satisfies one condition without verifying it meets all of them.

Pitfall #4: Over-Complicating Simple Multi-Figure Questions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Not all multiple-figure questions are complex. Some are actually quite straightforward—they simply require looking up one value in Figure 1 and another value in Figure 2 without any sophisticated integration. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Over-thinking these questions wastes time</strong>. To avoid this: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Assess question complexity before overthinking</strong>. If it's just asking for two separate facts from two figures, treat it as two simple lookups. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Don't assume integration is needed if it's not requested</strong>. "What was the temperature in Trial 1 and the pressure in Trial 2?" is asking for two separate values, not their relationship. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Read the question literally</strong>. If it asks for simple comparison or listing, don't invent complex relationships. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Trust straightforward interpretations</strong>. If a question seems simple, it probably is—answer it simply and move on. Some students, upon seeing "multiple figures", assume the question must be difficult and look for complexity that doesn't exist, wasting valuable time.

<strong>Example: Avoiding Pitfalls</strong><br><br>
<strong>Pitfall 1 Prevention:</strong> Question asks about enzyme A activity at pH 5<br>
Before reading: "I need enzyme A data at pH 5"<br>
Check figure label: "This is Figure 2, enzyme B" → WRONG FIGURE<br>
Switch to Figure 1: "enzyme A vs pH" → CORRECT<br>
Prevention: Always verify you're reading the correct figure and variable<br><br>
<strong>Pitfall 2 Prevention:</strong> Figure 1 shows "Sample 1, 2, 3", Figure 2 shows "Low, Medium, High"<br>
Don't assume Sample 1 = Low<br>
Check passage: "Sample 1 was tested at low concentration, Sample 2 at medium..." → Now you know the connection<br>
Prevention: Find the explicit link between different labeling systems<br><br>
<strong>Pitfall 3 Prevention:</strong> Question asks "When were BOTH T > 60°C AND P < 3 atm?"<br>
At t=20: Check Figure 1 → T = 65°C ✓ (Satisfies first condition)<br>
Don't stop here! Check Figure 2 → P = 3.5 atm ✗ (Fails second condition)<br>
Eliminate this option and check others<br>
Prevention: Verify ALL conditions before selecting an answer<br><br>
<strong>Pitfall 4 Prevention:</strong> Question: "What was the temperature in Trial 1 and the pressure in Trial 2?"<br>
This is just two simple lookups—don't overthink it<br>
Figure 1, Trial 1: T = 50°C<br>
Figure 2, Trial 2: P = 2 atm<br>
Done. No complex integration needed.<br>
Prevention: Answer simple questions simply
