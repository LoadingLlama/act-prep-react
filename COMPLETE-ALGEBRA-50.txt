QUESTIONS 11-17 (EASY - Remaining 7)
=====================================

Q11: What is 10 ÷ 2 + 3?
A) 2 ❌ This calculates 10 ÷ (2 + 3) = 10 ÷ 5 = 2. Division and addition have different priorities - divide first, then add.
B) 8 ✓ CORRECT. Division before addition: 10 ÷ 2 = 5, then 5 + 3 = 8.
C) 6.5 ❌ This might come from (10 + 3) ÷ 2 = 13 ÷ 2 = 6.5. Follow PEMDAS: division comes before addition.
D) 13 ❌ This adds first without dividing: 10 + 3 = 13. You must perform 10 ÷ 2 = 5 first.

Q12: Simplify: 9m - 5m + m
A) 5m ✓ CORRECT. Combine all like terms: 9 - 5 + 1 = 5, so the answer is 5m.
B) 4m ❌ This calculates 9 - 5 = 4 but forgets to add the final m (which equals 1m).
C) 15m ❌ This multiplies or adds incorrectly. The correct calculation is 9 - 5 + 1 = 5.
D) 3m ❌ This might subtract the m at the end: 9 - 5 - 1 = 3, but +m means add 1m.

Q13: What is (-2) × (-5)?
A) -10 ❌ This treats it like multiplying a negative by a positive. Two negatives multiplied give a positive.
B) 10 ✓ CORRECT. Negative times negative equals positive: (-2) × (-5) = 10.
C) -7 ❌ This adds instead of multiplies: -2 + (-5) = -7.
D) 7 ❌ This might come from |-2 - 5| = 7. The operation is multiplication: (-2) × (-5) = 10.

Q14: What is 2 + 6 ÷ 2?
A) 4 ❌ This adds first: (2 + 6) ÷ 2 = 8 ÷ 2 = 4. Division comes before addition in PEMDAS.
B) 5 ✓ CORRECT. Division before addition: 6 ÷ 2 = 3, then 2 + 3 = 5.
C) 8 ❌ This might add 2 + 6 = 8 and forget to divide. You must perform 6 ÷ 2 first.
D) 1.33 ❌ This might calculate 2 ÷ (6 ÷ 2) or 2 ÷ 6 + 2. The correct order is 2 + (6 ÷ 2) = 5.

Q15: Simplify: 2x + 3x - x
A) 4x ✓ CORRECT. Combine like terms: 2 + 3 - 1 = 4, giving 4x.
B) 5x ❌ This adds 2 + 3 = 5 but forgets to subtract the x (1x).
C) 6x ❌ This adds all coefficients: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6, treating -x as +x.
D) 2x ❌ This might only add the first two terms: 2x + 3x = 5x, then incorrectly calculate 5 - 1 = 2 or make another error.

Q16: What is 3 - (-4)?
A) -1 ❌ This treats the double negative as regular subtraction: 3 - 4 = -1. Subtracting a negative is the same as adding.
B) 7 ✓ CORRECT. Subtracting a negative equals adding: 3 - (-4) = 3 + 4 = 7.
C) -7 ❌ This might calculate -(3 + 4) = -7. The correct operation is 3 + 4 = 7 (positive).
D) 1 ❌ This subtracts: 4 - 3 = 1, reversing the operation or making a sign error.

Q17: Simplify: 5p + 2q - 3p + q
A) 2p + 3q ✓ CORRECT. Combine p terms: 5 - 3 = 2, giving 2p. Combine q terms: 2 + 1 = 3, giving 3q.
B) 8p + 3q ❌ This adds 5 + 3 instead of subtracting: 5 - 3 = 2, not 8.
C) 2p + q ❌ This correctly finds 2p but forgets to add the implied 1 in the final +q: 2q + q = 3q.
D) 5pq ❌ This incorrectly combines different variables into a product. You can only combine like terms.

D) 9x^2 ❌ This adds all coefficients incorrectly and combines unlike terms. You cannot add x^2 and x terms together.

Q21: What is (-10) ÷ 2?
A) -5 ✓ CORRECT. Negative divided by positive equals negative: -10 ÷ 2 = -5.
B) 5 ❌ This gives the absolute value but wrong sign. A negative divided by a positive is always negative.
C) -8 ❌ This might subtract: -10 - 2 = -12, or make another error. The operation is division: -10 ÷ 2 = -5.
D) -20 ❌ This multiplies instead of divides: -10 × 2 = -20. The operation is division.

Q22: Simplify: 4(x + 2) - 3x
A) x + 8 ✓ CORRECT. Distribute: 4x + 8, then subtract: 4x - 3x = x, giving x + 8.
B) 4x + 8 - 3x ❌ This distributes correctly but doesn't combine like terms. Simplify further: 4x - 3x = x.
C) 7x + 8 ❌ This adds the x coefficients: 4 + 3 = 7 instead of subtracting. It should be 4 - 3 = 1.
D) x + 2 ❌ This correctly finds x but forgets that 4 × 2 = 8, not 2.

Q23: What is 3 × 4 - 2 × 5?
A) 2 ✓ CORRECT. Multiply first (left to right): 3 × 4 = 12 and 2 × 5 = 10, then subtract: 12 - 10 = 2.
B) 10 ❌ This might calculate 3 × 4 = 12, then forget to subtract. Or calculate (3 × 4 - 2) × 5 incorrectly.
C) 30 ❌ This might calculate (3 × 4) × (2 × 5) or add instead of subtract. Follow PEMDAS carefully.
D) -2 ❌ This reverses the subtraction: 10 - 12 = -2. The correct order is 12 - 10 = 2.

Q24: Simplify: -5y - (-3y)
A) -2y ❌ This treats the double negative as regular subtraction: -5y - 3y = -8y. Subtracting a negative means adding.
B) 2y ❌ This has the correct magnitude but wrong sign. The calculation is -5 + 3 = -2, which is negative.
C) -2y ✓ CORRECT. Subtracting a negative equals adding: -5y - (-3y) = -5y + 3y = -2y.
D) -8y ❌ This calculates -5y - 3y = -8y, treating -(-3y) as -3y. Double negative becomes positive: -(-3y) = +3y.
