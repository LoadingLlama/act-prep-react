Chapter 16: Quadratics
Quadratics are mathematical expressions containing a term to the second degree with a standard form of

y=ax*+bx+c
For quadratics on the ACT, you need to be able to multiply binomials (FOIL), factor, interpret quadratics on a
graph, use the quadratic formula, and find the vertex.

G) Multiplying Binomials
In order to multiply binomials, you will need to FOIL, which stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last. You are
likely very familiar with how to multiply binomials by now, but just in case you can use the example below to

review.

To multiply (2x + 3)(x + 6)...

First terms: (2x)(x) = 2x?
Outer terms: (2x)(6) = 12x
Inner terms: (3)(x) = 3x

Last terms: (3)(6) = 18

so we get: (2x + 3)(x + 6) = 2x? +12x+ 3x+18 = 2x7+15x+18
Multiplying Perfect Squares — Don’t Forget to FOIL
When multiplying perfect squares, make sure to avoid the common mistake of forgetting to FOIL.

(x +5)? #x2425
To help avoid this mistake, you can write the perfect square as two expressions and then FOIL.

(x +5)? =(x+5)(x +5) = x2 4+5x+5x4
25
So

(x +5)? =x?24+10x+25

Example 1: Which of the following is equivalent to (2x + 3)? + 4x ?
A. 4x*+16x+9

B. 4x*+4x+9

C. 2x*+4x+3

D. 6x? +9

Solution: To solve, multiply out the squared expression and then combine like terms.

(2x + 3)? + 4x
(2x + 3)(2x + 3) +4x

Ax* +12x+9+4x
Ax? + 16x +9
The answer is A.

Shortcut Method — Substitution: In Chapter 2, we discussed using substitution (plug in a number for x) to
solve a question like this. Solving simpler questions like Example 1 algebraically works but using substitution
is a good backup method. This trick is particularly useful if you ever get stuck trying to solve algebraically, as
you will still be able to find which answer choice is correct.

Factoring Quadratics
On the ACT, you often need to factor quadratics. Factoring can help you simplify expressions or identify the
solutions of a quadratic equation.

The “Box” Method
We can use the “box” method to find the factors for a quadratic equation. The factors will appear on the
outside of the box and the quadratic will appear in the box.
To see how this works, let’s factor the quadratic below:

f(x) = 3x7-x-2

x

1. Place the x? term in the top left of the box. Place the number in the bottom right.

3x]

3x2

2. Write down the two terms that must multiply to the top left term (3x and x)
outside the box.

—?

3. Identify which number(s) can multiply to the number in the bottom right of the

x

box (1 and —2, 2 and —1).

—1

3x}

3x? | —3x

2)

2x

4. Place the pairs of number outside the box. You have the correct setup when the
top right and bottom left boxes (the x-terms) add up to the middle term in our

—2

quadratic, which in this example is —x. The factors appear on the outside of the
box.

5. Write down the quadratic in factored form.

3x7 -x-2=(3x+2)(x-1)

There are other ways to factor quadratics. If you have a different method that works for you, use that method.
We will not review factoring any more beyond this example in this book. If you need to review factoring, look
up some lessons and practice problems online and in your textbooks.

“Easy to Factor” Quadratics
Keep an eye out for perfect squares and difference of squares on the ACT. These are very common in
quadratics questions, and they can be factored quickly and easily as long as you spot the pattern. The table
below shows the three common “easy to factor” quadratics you should know.

Example

Perfect Square (Addition)

Perfect Square (Subtraction)

(x—y)* =x* -—2xy+ y?

(x -—3)? =x*-6x4+9

Difference of Squares

(x+ y)(x-y) =x? -y?

Example 2: For {x|x # 3}, which of the following expressions is equal to — +3x+1?

A, SU
x-3

OB x243x49

Cx-4 D. 4x-3

Solution: To simplify, we need to factor the numerator of the fraction and see if any expressions cancel.
x2-7x+4+12
x-3

+3x+1=

(x-3)(x-4)
x-3

+3x+1

Since there is an x — 3 in the numerator and the denominator, we can cancel these and then combine like
terms.

SPA)
1 234414 = x-443x41= 4x-3
x*x—-3

The answer is D.

Shortcut Method — Substitution: Pick a value for x and plug that value into the original equation. Here, we
pick x = 2, the original equation is equal to 5. Then, plug in x = 2 to the answer choices and look for which

one 1s equal to 5.

Solutions, Roots, x-intercepts, and Zeros for Quadratic Equations
The ACT may ask you to find the “solutions,”

99

66

“roots,” x-intercepts,” or “zeros” of a quadratic equation. All

these terms refer to the values of x that make f(x) = 0. Remember, all these terms mean the same thing. We
will refer to these as the “solutions” in the rest of this chapter.
To find the solution(s), set the quadratic equation equal to zero and factor. Let’s pick up with the example we
are currently working on.

3x*-x-2=0
We just showed how we can factor this quadratic to get

(3x
+ 2)(x-1) =0
To find the solutions, set each factor equal to zero and solve.
3x+2=0

x-1=0

2

x=--

and

3

x=1

The solutions are x = = and x = 1.
Remember that the solutions are also the x-intercepts if the quadratic is graphed (more on this on the next

page).
Example 3: What is the sum of the roots of the polynomial f(x) = x2 — 11x +18?
A.

—11

B. —7

C. 7

D. 11

Solution: To solve, we need to find the values of x that make f(x) = 0.

x? —11x+18=0
We factor the quadratic and then set each factor equal to zero.

(x -2)(x-9) =0
x=2,9

The solutions are 2 and 9. The sum of the roots is 2

+9 = 11. The answer is D.

Chapter 16: Quadratics

Example 4: Given that x = 3 is a solution to x* — bx + 12 = 0, which of the following polynomials is
a factor of x? — bx +12?
A.

x—4

B.

x-—2

C.x+3

D.

x+4

Solution: Since x = 3 is a solution, we know that (x — 3) is one polynomial factor of x? — bx + 12. We will
call the other unknown polynomial (x + a) and solve.

(x —3)(x
+a) = x*—bx+12
So, how can we figure out what a is? Think about our FOIL and how we get the +12 on the right side: we

must multiply —3 by a. So a = —4. The other factor must be (x — 4).

(x —3)(x
-—4) = x* -—bx +12
The answer is A.

How Solutions Appear on a Graph
Roots or solutions appear as the x-intercepts when graphed. When you have a quadratic or other polynomial
in factored form, you can see where the x-intercepts will be. We will review the rules for multiplicity (the
power to whicha factor is raised) and zeros for polynomial functions below:

y = (x+2)(x—- 4)

(—2,0)

y =(x-1)

TIP — Functions With No Solution

If a function never crosses the x-axis, that function has no real solutions.
In other words, the function does not have any x-intercepts.

As an example, the function f(x) to the right has no real solutions. This
function cannot be factored to solve for any real values of x.
If you used the quadratic equation, the solutions are complex numbers.

tM,

Solution: To solve this question, we need to look at the behavior of the function at each of the x-intercepts.

There are x-intercepts at x = —2, x = 1, and x = 3, so we need to see the factors (x + 2), (x — 1), and
(x — 3) in the correct answer. Now, we need to find out what power each term should be raised to. At

x = —2 and x = 1, the function bounces, so the (x + 2) and (x — 1) terms are squared. At x = 3, the
function goes straight through, so the (x — 3) should be to the first power. The answer is A.
Shortcut Solution — Use Your Graphing Calculator (if you have one): For those of you with a graphing
calculator who know how to use it, you can just graph the answer choices and see which one matches the
graph! Sure, it may take some time, but you will be able to guarantee that you get the correct answer.
In general, remember you can always use your graphing calculator to find the zeros for any quadratic functions
or to see what the graph of any equation looks like. Many students forget to use their calculators for questions
like this.

@) The Quadratic Formula
If a quadratic is not easily factorable, you will need to use the quadratic formula to solve for the solutions of a
quadratic function. You will need to have the quadratic formula memorized.

For ax* + bx +c = 0, the solution(s) are given by:

x =

—b +yV b2-4ac

The answer is B.

Using the quadratic formula is not too common on the ACT, but you should still memorize the equation just in
case. If you do need to use the quadratic formula, it will usually appear on the hardest questions from 30-45.

Chapter 16: Quadratics

The Discriminant
In the quadratic formula, the discriminant is the b* — 4ac term under the radical. This term is very important
because it can quickly tell us how many real or complex solutions there will be for any quadratic function. The
exact value of the discriminant is not important, but whether it’s positive, negative, or zero is!

Discriminant Value

Types of Solutions

b* —4ac > 0

2 real solutions

b* — 4ac = 0

1 real solution

b* —4ac <0

0 real solutions, 2 complex solutions

You should memorize these rules. If you ever see a question about the number of solutions to a quadratic
function, use the discriminant to solve.

Example 7: How many rational roots are there to the equation 2x? — 7x +9?
A. 0

B.

1

C. 2

Solution:

D. 3

Discriminant = b? — 4ac = (—7)* — 4(2)(9)
Discriminant = —23

The discriminant is negative, so there are no real solutions. The answer is A.

Example 8: In the system of equations below, m is a constant. For which of the following values of m
does the system of equations have exactly 1 real solution?

y=x*-—8x+10
y=m-—2x
A. —2

B. —-1

C. 0

D.

1

Solution: To start, we set the equations equal.

x? —8x+10=m-— 2x

x? —6x+(10—m) =0
If the system of equations has one real solution, the equation above should have one real solution and the
discriminant should be equal to 0.

Discriminant = b* — 4ac = (—6)? — 4(1)(10 — m) = 0
At this point, we can either test each of the answer choices to see which one makes the discriminant equal 0 or
solve algebraically form. Below shows how to solve algebraically.

(—6)? — 4(1)(10 — m) =0
36 -40+4m=0
—-4+4m=0
4m
= 4
m=1
The answer is D.

Just to be clear, Example 9 is an extremely difficult question and would be one of the “who gets a 36”
questions on the test. Do not expect to see any questions like this on test day. That being said, this is
absolutely fair game, and questions of similar difficulty have been on the test before.

The Vertex
The vertex is the highest or lowest point of a parabola. For the parabola shown below, the vertex is at (1, —4).
You should memorize the vertex form equation shown below.

y=(x-1)2-4

When a quadratic is written in vertex form, we can tell what the vertex is without graphing. As you can see in

the example above, we can tell the vertex is at (1,—4). We can think of the vertex as the midpoint of a
parabola because the x-coordinate of the vertex is always the midpoint of the two solutions, or x-intercepts.
The x-coordinate of the vertex is equal to the average of the solutions. Using the parabola above as an
example, we can see how this works. Since the solutions to the parabola are located at x = —1 and x = 3, the
x-coordinate of the vertex is at x =

—14+3

= 1, which matches the graph.

Remember, the vertex is always the maximum or minimum of a quadratic. For the example above, the
minimum is at y = —4.

Example 9: For the equation f(x) = (x — 6)(x + 2), what is the value of x at the minimum value of
the function?
A.

—2

B. 0

C. 2

D. 4

Solution: The minimum value of a parabola is at the vertex, so we need to find the coordinates of the vertex.
Since the function is already in factored form, we see the solutions are at x = 6 and x = —2. The x-coordinate
of the vertex is the average of the solutions, so we can find
_ 64+(-2) _
==

2

The x-coordinate of the vertex is at x = 2, so the answer is C.
Shortcut Method — Backsolve: To find which answer choice minimizes the function, plug the answer

choices in for x and see which one gives you the smallest value for f(x).

The average method works perfectly if you are given a quadratic that is already factored. But what if you are
not given a quadratic in factored form or vertex form? Good news! There is a second way to quickly find the
vertex.

For any quadratic in the form of ax* + bx + c, you can find the x-coordinate of the vertex using
b
Za

Make sure you memorize this equation! It can really help you quickly and easily solve any questions where
you need to find the vertex of a parabola.

Example 10: Andre runs a business that sells used cameras. To get the cameras ready to sell, Andre must

spend x hours repairing and cleaning each camera. The equation P(x) = —0.05x? + 0.4x + 0.9 models
the percentage of profit, P, that Andre gets from selling a camera. Which of the following shows the
number of repair hours that maximizes Andre’s percentage of profit for selling a camera?
A. 3

B. 4

C. 6

D.

8

Solution: Here, we need to find where Andre’s percentage of profit is maximized, so we need to find the
vertex of the equation. Since the leading value in the parabola is negative, the parabola is downward facing, so
the vertex will be the maximum of the graph. The number of hours will be on the x-axis, so we just need to
find the x-coordinate of the vertex to solve.

To find the x-coordinate of the vertex, we can use the equation we just introduced above:
b

Shortcut Method #1 — Backsolve: The question asks which value of x maximizes the function. To solve,

plug the answer choices back into the function and see which one gives the biggest value for P(x).
Shortcut Method #2 — Graph the Function: If you have a graphing calculator, you can also graph the
equation and find the maximum value. Make sure to use your calculator as much as possible on test day, as it
can often shortcut many questions that are difficult to solve algebraically.
