Chapter 25: Complex Numbers
Complex numbers are a combination of real and imaginary components expressed in the form a + bi, where a
and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit. The imaginary unit is defined as

i=vV-1
Since part of complex numbers are “imaginary,” it is difficult to grasp how they work. But do not worry, you
only need to learn a few methods for how to handle complex numbers when they appear on the ACT.

Adding and Subtracting Complex Numbers
For addition and subtraction with complex numbers, we combine like terms. For example,

(84+ 5i) + (5 —2i) = 134+ 3i
Simple right? For subtraction questions, always make sure that you distribute the negative sign to both terms.

(2-31) -(5-7) =2-3i1-5+7i=-3+4i
Many students make the mistake of forgetting to distribute the negative sign and get an answer of —3 — 10i.
Be careful because the ACT will have this common mistake as an incorrect answer choice.
Example 1: What is the difference of complex numbers 22 — 14i and 7 — 3i ?
A. 15-17i

B.15-11i

CC. -15+11i

D. 29-17i

Solution: Set up the equation and combine like terms.

(22 —14i) — (7 — 3i) = 22 -141-—-7 + 3i=15-11i
The answer is B.

Multiplying Complex Numbers
Before we go into the details of how to multiply complex numbers, you need to know that

i=-1
Multiplying complex numbers is just like multiplying binomials: use FOIL, which stands for First, Outer,
Inner, Last. For example,

(3 — 5i)(2
— 21) = 6 — 6i — 10i + 1072 = 6 — 161 + 107?

We are not done yet. Since there is an i? term when we multiply complex numbers and i? = —1, we must
plug in —1 for i?.
6 — 16i + 10(—1)
Combining the numbers, we get the answer of
—4—-16i

Example 2: What is the product of complex numbers 1 — 3i and 11 + 2i ?
A.

11-6i

B.

12 -i

C.

11
— 38i

D.

17 —31i

Solution: Multiply the two imaginary numbers together and combine like terms.

(1 — 3i)(11 + 2i) = 11 + 2i — 333i — 6i7 = 11 — 31i — 6i?
Now, plug in —1 for i? and combine the numbers.

Chapter 25: Complex Numbers

11 — 31i-—6(-1) = 17 -31i
The answer is D.

The Complex Conjugate
All complex numbers have a complex conjugate. The complex conjugate is a complex number with an
identical real part and an imaginary part with the opposite sign. In algebra terms,
a+ bi and a — bi are complex conjugates.
If you prefer numbers,
2 + 3i and 2 — 3i are complex conjugates.

To find the complex conjugate of any complex number, switch the sign of the imaginary part.
So why does this matter? The complex conjugate is important because the product of any complex number
and its complex conjugate is a real number.

(a + bi)(a — bi) = a* + b*
With numbers, we can see how the imaginary terms cancel out and we just get numbers.

(2+ 3i)(2-—3i) = 4-6i1+
6i- 917 = 4-917 = 4-—9(-1) = 13

Notice that 27 + 3% = 13, so we can skip all that math if we memorize the shortcut for the product of complex
conjugates.
Complex conjugates are most often used when complex numbers are fractions with the imaginary part in the
denominator. Fractions are not allowed to have the i in the denominator. To fix this problem, we can multiply
the top and bottom of the fraction by the complex conjugate. For example, if we are given
10
1—-2i

we need to multiply the top and bottom of the fraction by the complex conjugate, which here is 1 + 2i.

TIP — Use Your Calculator
If you calculator has an i button, you can type most complex numbers questions into your calculator,
and it will tell you the answer. You do not need to do any math! For those of you with a TI-83, TI-84
TI-Nspire (non CAS), and many Casio calculators, you can enter complex numbers in your calculator! If
you have a different type of calculator, it is worth looking up if you have an i button.
To see how this trick works, go back to Examples 1—3 that we just solved and plug them into your
calculator. When you press ENTER, the calculator will show you the correct answer!

The Powers of i
You should memorize the following pattern of i powers.

ji=i
i

2— —1

3 = —t

i*=1
Knowing this pattern will be essential to solving certain imaginary numbers questions that ask you to solve for

a higher power of i, such as i1°?. The method for solving these questions is covered in Chapter 20 on p. 192,
so you can go to that chapter to learn how to solve questions with higher powers of i.

For most students, that is all that you need to know about complex numbers!
The ACT will also rarely include questions that involve the complex plane, which we will discuss next. Since

it is very rarely tested, the complex plane can be skipped for students on a time crunch to get ready for the
ACT. In general, it is only important for students aiming for top math scores who want to know everything

that can be on the ACT.

Advanced Complex Number Topics
The following advanced complex number topics are rarely tested on the ACT. If these topics do appear on the
test, they are usually later in questions 35-45. The good news is these questions are usually pretty easy to
solve as long as you know the rules that you will learn in the rest of this chapter.

The Complex Plane
The complex plane is a way to represent complex numbers on a coordinate plane. The complex plane works

just like the standard (x, y) coordinate plane, except that now the x-axis is “real” and the y-axis is
“imaginary.” For graphing complex numbers, you need to know the following rule:

Any complex number a + bi is graphed on the complex plane at point (a, b).
Let’s graph 3 + 4i, 1 — 3i, and —1 + 2i in the complex plane.

U~

For 3 + 4i, the point is at (3,4). This makes sense because the complex number has a value of 3 for the real
number, which is on the x-axis, and a value of 4 for the imaginary number, which is on the y-axis. For the

same reasoning, 1 — 3i is at (1, —-3) and —1 + 2i is at (—1, 2).
Example 4: When graphed in the complex plane, the sum of complex numbers —2 + 4i and —3 — 2i

appears in which quadrant?
A.

I

B. U

Cc.

Ul

D. IV

Solution: First, we need to add the complex numbers together.

(—2+ 4i) + (-3 -— 21)

= -5+2i

The complex number —5 + 2i will be at point (—5, 2) in the complex plane, which is in quadrant II. The
answer is B.

Absolute Value of a Complex Number
The absolute value of a complex number is equal to its distance from the origin in the complex plane.

la
+ bi| = Va? + b?
As an example, for the complex number 3 + 41, we get

13+ 4i] =/32 +42 =V94+
16 =V25=5
This equation is just the Pythagorean theorem in disguise. 3 + 4i is at (3, 4) in the complex plane. To find the
distance from the origin to the point (3, 4), we can draw a triangle. The triangle will have a base of 3 anda

height of 4 and 32 + 4? = 52, which tells the distance from the origin is 5.

Solution:

|7 —4i| = v72 +42 =v65

The answer is D.

Distance Between Complex Numbers
To solve for the distance between two complex numbers, we find the distance between the numbers on the
complex plane. In other words, we just use the distance formula!

For any two complex number a + biand c + di, distance = (a — c)? + (b— d)?
Let’s try this with complex numbers 2 + 4i and —3 + i.

Distance = J(2 — (-3))2 + (4-1)? = v52+4+3% = ¥25+9

= 34

We can also solve for the distance between complex number by graphing them in the complex plane. Once we
have the points graphed, we can drawa triangle and solve for the distance.

From the diagram above, we know the base of the triangle is 5 and the height is 3, so we can use the
Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse, which is the distance between the two complex numbers.

Distance = V52 +32 = ¥254+9

= 34

Example 6: What is the distance, in coordinate units, between 6 — 3i and 2 + 7i on the complex plane?

A. 4

B. 4V5

Cc. 2/29

D. 2V41

Solution: Distance = (6 — 2)? + ((—3) — 7)? = /42+(—10)? = V¥16+100 = V116= 2V29
The answer is C.

Chapter 26: Word Problems
One of the challenges of the ACT Math Test is dealing with everyone’s least favorite questions: word
problems. Word problems are often written in a way that makes it confusing to figure out exactly what is
happening in the question. Word problems include a wide variety of math topics that we have already learned

in this book, so we will not cover any specific type of word problem in this chapter. Instead, we will focus on
the tips that can help you solve all types of word problems more effectively and efficiently.

Tip #1 — Do Not Be Intimidated
Word problems look scary. Many students see a big paragraph and say, “no way, I can’t solve that.” They feel
intimidated before even trying to solve the question. Do not let this be you! Word problems at their core are
no more difficult than any other ACT Math questions. When you see a big paragraph on test day, take a deep

breath and solve it one step at a time.

Tip #2 — Turn Words into Equations
When approaching a word problem, take it one sentence at a time. As you read through the question, identify
each piece of key information and write it down in an equation. If you can convert the question from a word
problem into an equation or equation(s), the question will be much easier to solve.
One of the most common types of word problems is a system of equations question, which we covered in
Chapter 15 on pp. 129-130. For these questions, you will need to turn the word problem into two equations.

Once you have converted the word problem into two equations, you will be able to solve the question with the
methods we learned in Chapter 15.

Tip #3 — Backsolve with the Answer Choices
For some word problems, writing your own equation(s) is very difficult and may not be the fastest or easiest
way to solve. If you cannot write out the equation(s) or are not sure if the equation(s) that you wrote are
correct, try backsolving. Sometimes it is faster and easier to take the answer choices, go through the steps of
the word problem, and see if you have the correct answer. Even if you cannot tell which answer is correct,
backsolving can often help you eliminate some answer choices and make a better guess. If you need to review
how to backsolve, go back to Chapter 1.

Tip #4 — Guess and Move on (If You Have To)
If you get to a word problem, try using the tips above, and still have no idea how to solve it, circle the
question, bubble in your best guess, and move on! It is easy to waste a lot of time reading and rereading long,
confusing word problems. Students who do this often end up running out of time. Save those precious
minutes to answer more questions that you know how to solve. We know it sounds backwards but giving up
quickly on a word problem that you have no idea how to solve may help you actually get a better score.
If you complete the rest of the questions in the section and have time remaining, you can always come back to
any questions that you guessed on. Sometimes, when re-reading the question, you will realize how to solve it.
It is easier to think more clearly when you are no longer worried about finishing the rest of the questions on the
test.
