Chapter 15: Logical Placement
Logical placement questions ask you to place a sentence in the paragraph. These questions are all about
context. To find the correct answer, plug the sentence into each potential spot in the answer
choices and re-read the paragraph. When checking the placement, make sure that you read the
sentence(s) before and after the sentence you are placing. Many students make mistakes by not
continuing to read the sentence(s) after where the sentence is being placed. The correct placement
should flow smoothly and fit in with the context of the paragraph.

TIP - Notice the Bracketed Numbers [1] or Letters [A]
As you are reading the passages, some paragraphs will have bracketed numbers at the beginning of
each sentence. On the ACT, it will look just like this:
[1] Morgan Freeman’s smooth voice is one of the many things that have made him an A-list
celebrity. [2] Everyone has probably tried to do a Morgan Freeman impression, but nobody can
match the real thing. [3] Still, that has never stopped me from trying to
Bracketed numbers only appear for a logical placement question, so read these paragraphs
more carefully. Be aware that the paragraph may currently be out of order, so it may seem confusing
when you first read it.
Bracketed letters appear when a logical placement question will be at the end of the passage.
When reading the passage, you do not need to pay attention to the letters. Just know there will be a
question at the end of the passage asking you where to place a sentence.

bars, which are delicious. [3] But have you ever

SUOW

had chocolate from Switzerland? [4] Take a real
Swiss chocolate like Lindt, for example. [5] The

after sentence 4

. after sentence 5

higher percentage of cacao, 23 percent in Lindt
chocolate in comparison with only 11 percent in
Hershey’s, results in a much darker, richer taste,
and the lower sugar content brings out the
natural bitterness of the chocolate. [6] The Swiss
really know how to make chocolate properly. [7]
It just melts in your mouth and has such a rich,
bold flavor with just the right amount of
bitterness.

For the sake of logic and coherence, Sentence
6 should be placed:

last twenty years. [2] Before the mid 1990s, there

A. where it is now

was absolutely no in-flight entertainment for

B. after sentence 2

passengers. [3] Seats had no screens in the back

C. before sentence 4

of each headrest with on-demand movies, music,

D. after sentence 7

and games. [4] There were not even those old,
clunky TVs that folded down from the ceiling
every few rows and played just one movie for the
entire plane. [5] Even portable music devices, like
the iPod or Walkman, had not been invented yet.
[6] All passengers could do was read or sleep. [7]
Now, | actually look forward to catching up on the
movies that I missed on long flights. [8] It sure
makes the time go by much more quickly while
flying.

[1] Cancer occurs when cells undergo a DNA

3.

For the sake of logic and coherence, Sentence

mutation and begin to replicate uncontrollably.

2 should be placed:

[2] Most mutations are “silent” mutations that

A. where it is now

have no tangible effects. [3] These cancerous cells

B. before sentence 1
C. after sentence 4

begin to divide uncontrollably and form

D. before sentence 6

dangerous tumors. [4] What most people do not
know is that mutations occur in our cells all the
time. [5] Only mutations to specific parts of
certain genes, like the p-53 gene, can lead to cells
becoming cancerous. [6] As a result, most cancer
research to date has focused on p-53 and other
similar genes.

fungi. [3] However, only N. hemsleyana pitchers
have acquired traits to attract bats. [4] They do

after sentence 1
after sentence 2

. after sentence 3

not eat the bats but rather benefit from the bat’s
guano. [5] The bats benefit because the plants
provide a perfectly sized shelter to rest in. [6]
These tropical pitcher plants have evolved in
shape to stand out against a bat’s echolocations.

The writer wants to add the following

[1] When he was born in Hong Kong to poor

parents, no one could have imagined Jackie Chan
would grow up to be an American movie star. [2]
It all started with his passion for Kung Fu and his
academic struggles as a child. [3] This ultimately
resulted in him joining the China Drama Academy

As a child, he had always loved the
slapstick comedy of Buster Keaton and
Charlie Chaplin.
The sentence would most logically be placed:

PSGAWD

where children were trained to be in Chinese
movies. [4] The school was brutal, with daily
training lasting 17-19 hours with little room for
pleasure. [5] After over ten years in the school,

after sentence 1
after sentence 2
after sentence 4
after sentence 7

Jackie graduated and, free to take roles of his own
choosing, would often select roles that involved
doing stunts no other actors dreamed of
attempting. [6] After experiencing many failures
and injuries, Jackie finally earned his first break as
Bruce Lee’s stunt double. [7] After Bruce Lee’s
death, Jackie tried to replicate Lee’s onscreen
persona but failed and realized he needed to do
something different. [8] So, he decided to blend
comedy and stunts and his career began to take
off.

[1] Snow leopards are one of the most elusive big

For the sake of logic and coherence, Sentence

cats in the world. [2] Sightings of snow leopards

A. where it is now

anyone seeing a snow leopard in person. [3] Due

B. after sentence 1
C. after sentence 2

to this challenge, almost all recorded footage of

D. after sentence 3

snow leopards is made using motion activated
cameras. [4] Even so, motion activated cameras
may still only get a very short glimpse, often only a
few seconds, ofa snow leopard. [5] Due to its
curious nature, a snow leopard may sniff the
camera before lazily moving on. [6] A single snow
leopard often has a territory of a few hundred
square kilometers, making it nearly impossible to

film. | ¢ |

[1] The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is a collection

7.

For the sake of logic and coherence, Sentence
6 should be placed:

of marine debris that litters the North Pacific

. where it is now

SUOW

Ocean, but the name is actually a bit of a
misnomer. [2] There are actually two distinct
patches. [3] One of the patches is located between

after sentence 1
after sentence 2

. after sentence 3

California and Hawaii, and the other is located
close to Japan. [4] Garbage keeps getting added to
these two distinct patches due to the ocean
currents. [5] The currents act as a gyre and slowly
suck pollution into these two distinct patches
where it gets stuck. [6] Further, although one
would think that the patches would be visible
from a satellite, both are actually enormous
accumulations of tiny pieces of plastic that cannot
even be seen from a plane.

[1] The concern that donations to political

policy makers has long perturbed the public. [2]
However, the effects of contributions on policy
makers’ decisions are incredibly difficult to assess.
[3] So how could an experiment be run ina
controlled manner? [4] To address this challenge,
the American Political Science Company decided
to run the first controlled experiment. [5] For the
experiment, they decided to schedule meetings
with 140 congressional offices. [6] The American
Political Science Company randomly assigned
whether the offices would be told that the caller
was a donor or not. [7] When officials in the
offices were told that the caller had donated,
meetings were five times more likely to be
scheduled than when the caller was not a donor.
