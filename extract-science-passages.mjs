    introduction: "Study of factors affecting photosynthesis rates in aquatic plants under controlled conditions.",
    passage_text: `Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, producing glucose and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water. In aquatic plants, this process is particularly important for maintaining oxygen levels in aquatic ecosystems.

Researchers conducted experiments to determine how various factors affect the rate of photosynthesis in aquatic plants. They measured the rate by counting oxygen bubbles produced per minute under different experimental conditions.

Table 1 shows the rate of photosynthesis at different light intensities for aquatic plants maintained at 25¬∞C with adequate CO‚ÇÇ supply.

Figure 1 displays the relationship between light intensity and photosynthesis rate, showing how the rate increases with light intensity up to a saturation point.

The experiments revealed that light intensity is the primary limiting factor at low intensities, but other factors become limiting at higher intensities. Temperature and CO‚ÇÇ concentration also significantly influence the photosynthesis rate.`,

    passage_text: `Electrical conductivity is a measure of a material's ability to conduct electric current. In solutions, conductivity depends on the concentration of ions and their mobility.

Scientists conducted two experiments to study factors affecting electrical conductivity in salt solutions.

Experiment 1: Various concentrations of sodium chloride (NaCl) solutions were prepared, and their electrical conductivity was measured at room temperature (25¬∞C).

Experiment 2: A 0.5 M NaCl solution was tested at different temperatures ranging from 10¬∞C to 50¬∞C to determine the effect of temperature on conductivity.

The results showed that conductivity increases with both salt concentration and temperature. This occurs because higher concentrations provide more charge carriers (ions), while higher temperatures increase ion mobility.

Figure 2 shows the linear relationship between temperature and conductivity for the 0.5 M NaCl solution.`,

    passage_text: `Atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased significantly since the Industrial Revolution. Scientists agree that this increase contributes to global warming, but there are different viewpoints on the relative importance of various factors.

Viewpoint 1: CO‚ÇÇ is the Primary Driver
Some scientists emphasize that carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) is the most significant greenhouse gas contributing to climate change. CO‚ÇÇ concentrations have increased from 315 ppm in 1960 to approximately 410 ppm in 2020. This viewpoint stresses that fossil fuel combustion is the dominant human activity causing climate change.

Viewpoint 2: Multiple Factors Approach
Other scientists argue that while CO‚ÇÇ is important, other greenhouse gases like methane (CH‚ÇÑ) and nitrous oxide (N‚ÇÇO) have much higher heat-trapping potential per molecule. They advocate for a comprehensive approach addressing all greenhouse gases and their sources.

Figure 3 shows atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ concentrations from 1960 to 2020, while Table 2 presents the relationship between CO‚ÇÇ levels and global temperature anomalies.`,

    introduction: "Study of inheritance patterns in flowering plants using controlled crosses.",
    passage_text: `Gregor Mendel's principles of inheritance explain how traits are passed from parents to offspring through discrete units called genes. Modern plant breeding relies heavily on these principles.

Experiment 1: Researchers crossed pure-breeding purple-flowered plants with pure-breeding white-flowered plants. All F1 offspring had purple flowers, suggesting that purple is dominant over white.

Experiment 2: F1 plants were allowed to self-pollinate to produce an F2 generation. The results showed a 3:1 ratio of purple to white flowers, confirming Mendel's predictions for a simple dominant-recessive trait.

Table 3 shows the results of both generations, demonstrating classic Mendelian inheritance patterns. The researchers also performed test crosses to verify the genotypes of the F1 plants.

These experiments confirm that flower color in this species follows simple Mendelian inheritance, with purple (P) being dominant over white (p).`,

Scientists studied various rock samples to understand the relationship between formation processes and mineral composition. They measured hardness using the Mohs scale, where diamond = 10 (hardest) and talc = 1 (softest).

Table 4 presents data on common minerals found in these rock types, including their hardness ratings and primary formation environments.

Figure 4 shows a geological cross-section illustrating how different rock layers form over time, with the oldest layers typically at the bottom due to the principle of superposition.

The study revealed that igneous rocks generally contain harder minerals, while sedimentary rocks often contain softer minerals due to their formation from weathered materials.`,

Experiment 1: Researchers measured the pH of various hydrochloric acid (HCl) solutions at different concentrations to establish the relationship between concentration and acidity.

Experiment 2: Different chemical indicators were tested to determine their color changes at various pH levels. Indicators are substances that change color depending on the pH of the solution.

Table 5 shows the relationship between HCl concentration and pH, demonstrating the logarithmic nature of the pH scale.

The experiments confirmed that as acid concentration increases, pH decreases proportionally on the logarithmic scale. Common substances like lemon juice (pH ‚âà 2), pure water (pH = 7), and baking soda (pH ‚âà 9) were used as reference points.`,

Study A - Orbital Mechanics: Scientists analyzed the orbital periods and distances of planets in our solar system. According to Kepler's laws, planets farther from the Sun have longer orbital periods and slower orbital speeds.

Figure 5 shows the relationship between planetary distance from the Sun and orbital period for the inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars).

Study B - Cellular Respiration: Researchers investigated how temperature affects the rate of cellular respiration in plant cells. Cellular respiration produces ATP (energy) and CO‚ÇÇ from glucose and oxygen.

Table 6 presents data showing how cellular respiration rate changes with temperature in controlled laboratory conditions.

Both studies demonstrate fundamental scientific principles: gravitational forces governing planetary motion and enzymatic reactions controlling biological processes.`,
