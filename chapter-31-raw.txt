Chapter 31: Arcs and Sectors
Arcs and sectors questions occasionally appear on the ACT. This topic is not as commonly tested as the rest of
the geometry concepts we covered in Chapters 3-4, but it is one that you should still be familiar with for test
day.

Arcs
The arc of a circle is a portion of the circumference. Arcs can be measured in two ways: the degree measure of
the arc or the length of the arc itself.

The degree measure of an arc is equal to the measure of the central angle intersecting the arc. The arc
length is the actual distance covered moving from point A to point B along the circle.

To solve arc questions, you need to memorize the two equations below. These are different versions of the
same equation. Being familiar with both the conceptual idea and the actual equation well help you solve
different types of arc questions on the ACT.

Example 2: Sherry is making a pie chart to represent the favorite ice cream flavor of her classmates. If 5

out of the 25 students in Sherry’s class selected strawberry as their favorite flavor, what should the
measure of the central angle, in degrees, be for the strawberry sector?
A.

B. 80

C. 95

D.

Solution: The proportion of the students who selected strawberry, 5, to the total students in class, 25, is
equal to the proportion of the measure of the central angle to 360°.

TIP — Inscribed Angle Theorem
An inscribed angle is an angle that has its vertex on a circle and whose sides are chords. While that fancy
definition may seem confusing, all you need to know for the ACT is the following rule:

0-4)

For an inscribed angle and central angle that intersect the
same portion of the arc, the inscribed angle is half the measure
of the central angle.

As you can see in the figure, the inscribed angle of 45°1s half of the
measure of the central angle of 90°. This rule does not come up
often on the ACT, but you should still memorize it just in case.

©) Sectors
The sector is the measure of the area of a portion of a circle. To solve sector questions, you need to memorize
the equations below.

SectorArea — Angle Measure

S _ 8

Area of Circle _

nmr2—- 360

360°

S = sector area

& = central angle

r = radius

Example 3: For the circle to the right, the radius is 6. If 2C = 150°, what is

D

the area of sector BCD?
A. 82

B. 102

C. 127

B

D. 15z

Solution: Using the sector equation above, we can plug in the values from the question and solve to find the
area of the sector.

Since both sides have 36 in the denominator, we can multiply both sides by 36 and cancel out the 36s to get

Example 4: Andrew bought a 12-inch diameter pumpkin pie and cut it into 12 equal slices. After eating

2 slices, he calculates that he consumed 480 calories. How many total calories are in the entire pie?
A.

1,440

B.

1,920

C2400

D. 2,880

Solution: The proportion of calories in two slices to calories in the entire pie is equal to the proportion of the
area of the 2 slices of pie to area of the entire pie.
