Chapter 23: Factorial, Permutations, Combinations, and
Organized Counting
On the ACT, you will have to answer a variety of “how many” questions, such as “how many outfits can a
person create with 3 shirts, 4 shoes, and 5 pairs of pants?” or “if a lock code consists of 3 numbers and 2
letters, how many different lock codes are possible?” To successfully answer these questions, you must
understand the differences in how to setup and solve using permutations, combinations, and organized
counting and know how factorials work.

Factorial
The factorial, symbolized by the “!”’, is a function that multiplies an integer by every integer below it. For

example,
5§!}=5xX4xX3x2x1
3!=3x2x1

For easy factorial questions on the ACT, that is all you need to know!
Example 1: The expression 2! + 4! is equal to:
A. 6

B. 24

C. 26

D. 720

Solution: Rewriting the factorial expression in terms of multiplication, we get
2!+41=(2x1)+(4x3x2x1)
2!+4!=2+
24
2!+
4! = 26

The answer is C. Many calculators also have a “!” button and can solve factorial questions for you. If you
set 2°

are unsure if your calculator has a “!” button, go look it up online.
Questions like Example 1 are the most common way factorials are tested on the ACT. However, more
advanced questions do appear at the end of the ACT, so if you are a stronger math student, make sure you
understand the equation below.

The factorial n! for a positive integer n is defined as n! = n(n — 1)(n — 2)... (2)(1)
This equation is the exact same rule that we learned above, but now it is written in fancy math terms. For any
integer n, you multiply n by every integer below it until you get to 1. Understanding this equation is important
for solving advanced factorial questions.

C.

~

nti

Solution: We can solve this question algebraically or can substitute in number.
Method #1 — Math Teacher Way: We can use the definition of factorial to write out the equation.
(3!))(n)(n — 1)(n — 2)... (2)C1)

(n+ 1)(n)(n — 1)(n — 2)...(2)(1)

math

Do you notice what cancels out once we have written it out in this form? The entire n! in the numerator

cancels out because we have an (n) on top and bottom, (n — 1) on top and bottom, and so on. The only terms
that do not cancel out are 3! and (n + 1).

6

The answer is B. Okay, so that was confusing. What is an easier way to solve this question?
Method #2 — Substitution (Cheat Method): We can pick a value to plug in for n and solve. To make the
numbers easy, let’s pick n = 2. Plugging in 2 for n we get:
312!

(3x2x1)(2x1)=

12

3... 2°~*«“‘< K2xtCOCO!
Our answer is 2. To tell which answer choice is correct, we plug inn = 2 to the answer choices and see which
one is equal to 2. The only one that give us 2 is B, so we can tell that the answer is B. Much easier, right?
Always look to use substitution when you see variables in the answer choices.
That is a difficult question that would appear late on the ACT Math Test, so if you find that confusing and are
not a strong math student, do not worry too much. You are not likely going to see a question like this on test
day.

Permutations
In permutations, the order matters. Ifthe order in which the objects are selected makes the outcome

different, we use a permutation to solve.
Example 3: A class with 15 students is selecting 3 different students for the positions of president, vice

president, and party planner. How many possible different selections can be made?
A.

135

B. 225

C. 455

D. 2,730

Solution: The order matters here because a different order of students being selected first, second, and third
leads to a different outcome of who is president, vice president, and party planner. We need to count every
possible selection, so we must use a permutation.
To solve a permutation, we use:
n!

nPy 7 (n-r)!
where n is the number of items we are choosing from and r is number of items we actually choose. Most

calculators have nPr programmed into them, so you likely do not need to memorize the equation. If your
calculator does not have it, you will need to memorize the equation.
For Example 3, n = 15 since we are selecting from 15 students, and r = 3 since we are choosing 3 students
for the positions.

15P3 =

15!

(15-3)!

= 2,730

The answer is D.

Chapter 23: Factorial, Permutations, Combinations, and Organized Counting

Combinations
In combinations, the order does not matter. In other words, if the order that you select the objects does not

affect the final outcome, we use a combination to solve.
Example 4: Andrew has 5 tickets to a baseball game and 1s going to invite 4 of his friends to go with him.
If Andrew has 12 friends, how many different combinations of 4 people can he invite?
A.

495

B. 792

C.

1,320

D.

11,880

Solution: The order does not matter here. Let’s say Andrew texts 4 friends to invite them to the game. As
long as Andrew asks the same 4 friends to go to the game with him, it does not matter who he texts first,
second, third, or fourth. The outcome (who attends the baseball game) is the same, so we use a combination.
To solve a combination, we use:
n!

nCy = ri (n-r)!
where 7 is the number of items we are choosing from and r is number of items we actually choose. As with

permutations, most calculators have nCr programmed into them, so you do not need to memorize the equation.
For example 4, n = 12 since we are selecting from 12 friends, and r = 4 since we are choosing 4 students to
give tickets to.
12!

Gasp = 495
12C4 = -——
The answer is A.

Permutations and combinations do appear on the ACT, but these are not as commonly tested as the organized
counting questions we are about to cover.

Organized Counting
Most “how many” questions on the ACT are not permutations or combinations, so we need to use a different
method to solve. For these questions, we can answer the question “how many choices do I have” for each
position where we need to select an item. To see how this works, let’s work through the examples below:
Example 5: For his graduation dinner, Eric needs to select his outfit. If Eric has 6 dress shirts, 5

pairs of dress pants, 7 ties, and 3 pairs of shoes, how many different outfits could Eric put on?
A.

30

B. 210

C. 630

D.

1,260

Solution: This example is the simplest type of organized counting question. We recommend drawing
out a sketch with positions for each item as shown below:

Shirts

Pants

=

x

x

x

Ties

Shoes

Total Outfits

All we need to do now is put the number of choices in each position. Since Eric has 6 shirts, we put a 6 in the
position for shirts. Since Eric has 5 pairs of pants, we put a 5 in the position from pants, and so on.

6
Shirts

5
Pants

x

7
Ties

x

3
Shoes

=

630
Total Outfits

To solve, multiply all the numbers together to find the total number of possibilities.
Eric has 630 possible outfits. The answer is C.

More advanced organized counting questions may at first seem far more difficult, but we can solve them in the
exact same way as example 5.
Example 6: Bertha’s Beans labels a 7-character code on each can of beans it produces? Each code

contains 2 letters followed by 5 numbers. The letters and numbers may repeat. How many 7-character
codes are possible?

A.

26(25)(10)(9)(8)(7)(6)

B. 262(105)

C. 265(102)

OD. 2(26)(10)

Solution: To start, sketch a diagram of the 7-character code.

Now, label how many choices we have at each spot. For the first spot in the code, we have 26 letters in the
alphabet, so there are 26 possible letters for that position. Since the letters can repeat, we can also have 26
possible letters for the second spot in the code. For the numbers, we have 10 numbers to pick from (0 through
9). Since the numbers can repeat, there are 10 possible options for all 5 number spots in the code.
Filling in the number of choices for each position, we get:
26

x

yx

=

number

To solve, multiply all the numbers together. There are 262(10°) or 67,600,000 possible 7-character codes.
The answer is B.

Example 7: The LockTight Safe Company just released its brand new safe. To access the safe, the

correct 6-character code must be entered. The first and last characters must be different letters. The
middle characters are all numbers, the numbers can be repeated, and the second character must be either a
0 ora 1. How many combinations are possible for the safe?
A.

655,200

B. 936,000

C.

1,300,000

D.

1,352,000

Solution: To start, sketch a diagram of the 6-character code:
x

x

Oor 1

x

number

x

number

x

number

=

letter

Let’s start with the letters. For the first character in the code, there are 26 possible options. The first and last
characters must be different letters. Once a letter is selected for the first character, there are only 25 other
letters left to choose from, so there are 25 possible options for the last character in the code.

25

Next, let’s deal with the numbers. The second character in the code must be a 0 or a 1, so there are only 2
possible options for this spot. The numbers can be repeated, so the other characters have 10 possible options.
Filling in the numbers, we get
26

Multiply the numbers together to solve. There are 1,300,000 possible combinations for the safe. The answer
is C.

Questions like examples 6 and 7 are very common on the ACT. Easier versions of these questions appear in
the middle of the test anywhere from questions 15-30 while more advanced ones appear in the last 15
questions. Use the “draw a diagram and label the spots” method that we used for these examples and solving
these questions should be quick and easy!

Advanced Combinations, Permutations, and Organized Counting
Advanced combinations, permutations, and organized counting questions are some of the most difficult
on the ACT Math Test, so this section is only for strong math students aiming for top ACT Math Scores.

If you are not a strong math student, do not worry about mastering this section.
There are a variety of ways the ACT can test you on these topics, so in the rest of this chapter we will cover the
most common ways the ACT has tested these in the past. Understanding the following examples will give you
the skills you need to handle these challenging questions 1n case you see them on test day.

Question Type #1 — Advanced Organized Counting
Example 8: At the end of a men’s basketball game, all 5 players on the court high five each other player
and the coach. What was the total number of high fives given?
A. 36

B. 25

C. 21

D.

15

Solution: We can solve this questions using combinations or organized counting. Both methods are shown,
so you can find out which seems easier to you.
Method #1 — Combinations: A high five takes a pair of people, so this question is actually just asking us to

find out how many pairs of 2 people can be selected from the 5 players and the coach. The order does not
matter, so we use a combination. We have 6 total people, son = 6, and need to select 2, so r = 2.

The answer is D. If that seems confusing or you do not feel confident with combinations, you may prefer
using method #2.
Method #2 — Organized Counting: The key to solving this question is to have an organized approach and to
recognize the pattern to save time. To make this simpler, let’s call the players A, B, C, D, E. Now, let’s
consider the first player A.
To high five the 4 other players and the coach, player A must make 5 high fives. We can show the high fives
as © to give a visual as well.
ASPB

A&E

A#& Coach

Total High Fives

Now, let’s consider player B. Player B has already high fived player A, so he only needs to high five players
C, D, and E and the coach.
Bec

BeD

BeE_

Be Coach

Total High Fives = 5 + 4

What about player C? Well, player C has already high fived players A and B, so he only needs to high five
placed D and E and the coach.
CeD

CeE

Ce# Coach

Total High Fives=5+4+3

Player D has already high fived players A, B, and C, so he only needs to high five player E and the coach.

E © Coach

Total High Fives

=5+44+3+4+2+4+1

Everyone has already high fived the coach, so we are done.
Total High Fives

=5+4+34+2+4+1=15

The answer is D. You likely recognized the pattern pretty quickly, so these questions can be solved pretty

quickly with this method. The organized counting method and pattern can appear in any similar questions
where we are being asked about the various ways to count events that involve making pairs.

Question Type #2 — Advanced Combinations and Counting Multiple Outcomes
Example 9: There are 12 donuts in a box in the break room. 7 of the donuts are glazed, 3 are chocolate,

and 2 are cinnamon sugar. If Trace randomly selects two donuts, what is the probability that he gets 1
chocolate donut and 1 cinnamon sugar donut?
1

A. =
11

1

B. =
12

1

Cc. =
22

1

D. —
24

Solution: The key to solving this question is understanding that we need to count two separate outcomes that
both end up with Trace getting 1 chocolate donut and 1 cinnamon sugar donut:
1st Donut Selected

2nd Donut Selected

Outcome #1

Chocolate

Cinnamon Sugar

Outcome #2

Cinnamon Sugar

Chocolate

We now need to find the probabilities for outcome #1 and outcome #2. The big mistake most students make is
only counting one of these outcomes. For the outcome #1, we need to find the probability of first getting a
chocolate donut and then getting a cinnamon sugar donut:
3

Probability (Outcome #1) = P(Chocolate) x P(Cinnamon Sugar) = — x

2

12°11

6

132

For outcome #2, we need to find the probability of first getting a cinnamon sugar donut and then getting a
chocolate donut:
3

Probability (Outcome #2) = P(Cinnamon Sugar) x P(Chocolate) = D x Ti

6

132

To get our final answer, we add the probabilities of both outcomes and simplify:
6

6

12

1

732132132,
11
The correct answer is A. Anytime you see a question like this asking you to find the probability of a specific
event, make sure that you remember that various orders can lead to the desired outcome and, to solve correctly,
you may need to solve for the probabilities of multiple outcomes.
