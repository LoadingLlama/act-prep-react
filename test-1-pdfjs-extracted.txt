Practice   ACT   #1  Instructions:  Please   print   off   this   practice   ACT   if   you   can   to   simulate   test-day   conditions   and   be   sure   to  follow   the   self-timing   guidelines   strictly.   Do   NOT   give   yourself   a   few   extra   minutes   to   finish  any   sections   of   the   test.   If   you   run   out   of   time,   guess   just   like   you   would   on   test   day.  You   can   find   the   self-timing   sheets   in   the   “Welcome   To   The   Ultimate   ACT   Course”   Course   in  the   lecture   titled   “Download   Practice   ACTs   +   How   To   Best   Use   Them.”   If   you   are   approved  for   extended   time,   use   the   extended   timing   sheets.   Otherwise,   use   normal   time.  Ideally,   it   is   best   to   take   your   practice   tests   in   the   morning   at   8:30am   to   simulate   test   day  (you   will   arrive   at   8:00am   on   test   day,   but   you   will   most   likely   not   actually   start   the   test  until   closer   to   8:30).   Take   the   practice   test   in   a   quiet   environment   without   interruptions.  Scoring:  Once   you   have   completed   this   practice   ACT,   you   can   use   the   answer   key   at   the   back   of   this  test   to   score   your   answers.   You   can   then   use   the   scoring   table   at   the   back   to   find   your  scores.   You   will   get   a   score   1-36   for   each   section   (English,   Math,   Reading,   Science).   Your  composite   score   is   an   average   of   your   4   section   scores   rounded   to   the   nearest   whole  number.

DIRECTIONS:  In  the  five  passages  that  follow,  certain  words   and   phrases   are   underlined   and   numbered.   In  the   right-hand   column,   you   will   find   alternatives   for   the  underlined   part.   In   most   cases,   you   are   to   choose   the  one   that   best   expresses   the   idea,   makes   the   statement  appropriate  for  standard  written  English,  or  is  worded  most  consistently   with  the  style  and  tone  of  the  passage  as   a   whole.   If   you   think   the   original   version   is   best,  choose  “NO  CHANGE.”  In  some  cases,  you  will  find  in  the   right-hand  column  a  question  about  the  underlined  part.  You  are  to  choose  the  best  answer  to  the  question.  You   will   also   find   questions   about   a   section   of   the   pas-  sage,   or   about   the   passage   as   a   whole.   These   questions  do   not   refer   to   an   underlined   portion   of   the   passage,   but  rather   are   identified   by   a   number   or   numbers   in   a   box.  For   each   question,   choose   the   alternative   you   consider  best   and   fill   in   the   corresponding   oval   on   your   answer  document.   Read   each   passage   through   once   before   you  begin   to   answer   the   questions   that   accompany   it.   For  many   of   the   questions,   you   must   read   several   sentences  beyond   the   question   to   determine   the   answer.   Be   sure  that   you   have   read   far   enough   ahead   each   time   you  choose   an   alternative.  PASSAGE   |  Double  the  Manta  Rays  There   are   thousands   of   new   animal   species   identified  T  each   year,   the   vast   majority   are   small   or   geographically  isolated.   So   as   graduate   student   Andrea   Marshall   studied  manta  rays,  which  are  neither  small   nor  isolated,  she  didn’t  expect  to  identify  a  new  species.

[1]   To   investigate,   Marshall   began   collecting   data.  [2]   Other   data   required   a   closer   look.   [3]   The   skin   of   all  mantas,   for   example,   is   embedded   with   tiny,   toothlike  “denticles.”   [4]   Marshall   found   that   denticles   on   some  mantas   were   randomly   spaced   and   occasionally  overlapped,   whereas   denticles   on   other   mantas   were  evenly   spaced   and   never   overlapped.   [5]   Another   discovery  was:   that   some   mantas   had   egg-shaped   masses   at   the   base  of   their   tail   fins,   [6]   Each   mass   contained   a   bony   spine  about   an   inch   long—the   vestige   of   a   stinging   barb   from  the   manta’s   ancestors.   [   *   |  Tn   2009,   Marshall   announced,   with  9  two   other   scientists,   that   indeed   there  py  is   two   manta   species.   The   reef   manta,  Manta   alfredi,   is   the   smaller   and   more  common   of   the   two.   Thriving   in   shallow   water,  it   kind   of   sticks   around   one   area.   In   contrast,   the  giant   manta,   Manta   birostris,   favors   deep   water  and   migrates   thousands   of   miles   a   year.  ACT-Cos  5.

“T  leave  the  creation  of  the  picture  to  the  sound  itself,”  ey  _  Klimas   says,  Klimas’s  idea  for   his  sonic  sculptures  were  sparked  »  by  the  experiments,   of  Swiss  scientist,  Hans  Jenny.  In  the  0  1960s,  Jenny’s   study  on  the  effects  of  sound  vibrations  a  on  various  materials.  For  example,   Jenny  discovered  that  low  sonic   tones  caused  powdery  substances  to  form  into  uniform  lines,  while  deeper  tones  caused  the  same   powder  to  form  into  more  nuanced  patterns.  [2]  Klimas  relies  on  similar  principles,  only   with  a  more  compelling  component:  music.  Klimas  has  photographed  sonic  sculptures  of  classical  music  by  Wagner  and  Bach; jazz  by  Miles  Davis,   Charlie  Parker,  and   John  Coltrane;  and   psychedelic   rock   by   Pink   Floyd   and   Jimi   Hendrix.  While  he  acknowledges  that  all  forms  of  music  can  generate   sonic  sculptures.  Klimas  says,  “I  3  typically   select  something  dynamic  and  percussive.”  That  would  certainly  impress  Jenny.

That   year,   Samuel   Hill   and   Samuel   Lancaster,  a   businessman   and   an   engineer,   respectively,   began  constructing   a   road   through   the   gorge   to   connect   the  towns   along   the   river.

Completed   in   1922,   the  highway   earned   the   local   nickname   “the   King   of   Roads.”  [3]  Impressive   as   it   was,   the   highway   was   soon   outmoded because   of  increased  traffic  and  larger   vehicles.   In  time,  Oregon   built   a   new   road   along   the   Columbia,   imuch   of  the   highway   was   destroyed   to   make   room;   other   stretches  were   abandoned.   By   1954,   only   the   western   third   of   the  original   road   was   still   in   use,   mainly   by   tourists   seeking  36  waterfalls.  [D]  ACT-Co3   10  50.  51.  52.  53,  54,  55.

Selling   Hip-Hop  One   night   in   the   late   seventies,  at   a   popular   club   in   New   York   City,  singer   and   music   producer   Sylvia   Robinson   had  =x,  ot  a  revelation.  At  the  time,  hip-hop  subculture—based  on   the   graffiti,   breakdancing,   deejaying,   and   rapping  art   forms—were   emerging   as   a   phenomenon.   Robinson  watched   as   DJ   Lavebay   Starski   spun   records   for   the  crowd   and   rapped   over   the   instrumental   breaks   in   the  music.   Every   time   the   DJ   chanted,   “Throw   your   hands  in   the   air,”   everyone   obeyed,   Robinson   could   hear   the  enthusiasm   shared   betwee   the   hip-hop   performer   and  his   audience.   She   knew   she   had   to   capture   that   excitement  on   record.  Robinson   wasted   no   time   in   recruiting   three   aspiring  rappers:   Big   Bank   Hank,   Master   Gee,   and   Wonder   Mike—  6  to   record   on   her   label   as   the   Sugarhill   Gang.   [¢s]   Wanting  to   re-create   the   feel-good   vibe   of   the   music   she'd   heard,  an   upbeat   disco   record   provided   the   background   that  66  the   rappers   rhymed   over.   The   resulting   track,   “Rapper's  6  sold   fourteen   million   copies;   Robinson   had Delight.  produced   the   first   rap   record   to   break   into   the   charts.

ne   ee   oe   oe   ee   oe  Nevertheless,   Robinson's   musical  7  instincts,   and   business   savvy   had   served   her   well  om  with   the   Sugarhill   Gang.   However,   there   was   more   to  hip-hop   music   than   party-ready   club   anthems.   She   hoped  to   capitalize   on   her   success   by   expanding   the   genre,  Robinson   signed   Grandmaster   Flash   and   the   Furious   Five,  a   group   that   already   had   a   following,   to   her   label.  Robinson   allowed   the   group   to   record   a   track   that  70  studio   musician   Edward   Fletcher   had   written.   The   track,  titled   “The   Message,”   encountered   new   commercial  7  hip-hop   ground   by   addressing   harsh   realities   of   inner-city  life.   It   was   a   far   cry   from   the   more   digestible   singles   the  group   had   previously   released   ‘ause   the   rappers   were  hesitant   to   record   it.   But   Robinson   believed   it   was   a  surefire   hit.   In   the   opposite   fashion,   Fletcher   and  3  Melle   Mel   (one   of   the   Furious   Five)   recorded   the  track,   which   became   the   group's   biggest   hit.  Its   socially   conscious   rhymes   helped   usher   in   a  4  new   generation   of   artists   and   secured   Robinson’s  ag  legacy   in   the   landscape   of   commercial   hip-hop.  67,  68.  69.  70.  71,  72.  73.  74,  NO   CHANGE  On   the   other   hand,  As   a   result,  DELETE   the   underlined   portion. pomp   NO   CHANGE  instincts,   and,   business   savvy  instincts   and   business   savvy  instincts   and   business   savvy, omom   NO   CHANGE  She   was   hoping  The   hope   was  Hoping come  Which   choice   most   effectively   indicates   that   Robinson  had   to   convince   Grandmaster   Flash   and   the   Furious  Five   to   record   “The   Message"?

Ganeshananthan   (©2008  by  Vasugi  Ganeshananthan).  He  met  her,  my  mother,  in  New  York  City,  and  the  Heart  said  plaintively:  Thump  thump  thump.   That  was  not  the  sound  of  illness.  Theirs  was  an   auspicious  meet-  ing,  although  no   one  had  troubled  to  check  the  align-  65  ment  of  the  stars;  the  young  woman  was  twenty-seven—old  for   a  prospective  bride?—but  she  did  not  look  it.  She  had  a  generous  face,  he  said  to  himself.  He  liked  her   glossy  sheaf  of   dark  hair,  her   sparse  10  brows,  her  pronounced  chin,  her  full  lower  lip.  She smiled  with   her  mouth  closed  because  she  did  not  like  her  teeth,  He  could  already   see  within  the   structure  of  her  face  how  she  would  become  thinner,  that  her  bones  would  give  her  older  face  a  certain  elegance,  a  chiseled  15  and  austere  severity.  He  liked  her  precision  in  even  the smallest   of  ta:  ike  arranging  hibiscus  in  a   vase.  Her  reserve,  her  inability   to  say   anything  truly  personal  in  public.  He  thought   she  might   be  full  of  secrets  and  wanted  to  know  them.  She  never  raised  her  voice,   but  20   she  did   not  speak  softly.  How  are  you?  That's  a  beauti- ful  sari.  How  are  the  children?  1  like  this  rice.  She  liked  her  food   steaming  and  spicy,  as  he  did.  She  made  her  own  clothes,  staying  up  late  into   the   night,  her  foot  on  the  pedal  of  a  sewing   machine  that  had   belonged  to  her  25  mother   and   had  crossed  the  ocean  with  her.  Her   hem-  lines  suited  both  the  times  and  her  young  pale  slimness,  which   reminded   him  of  a  flowering  tree  by  his  home  in  Jaffna.  He  never   caught  her   admitting   she  was  wrong;  her  words   clambered   around  that  impossibility,   but  so  30   sheepishly  that  he   found  it  endearing.  In  a  noisy  room  he  learned  to  tell  the   clear  bell  sound  of  her  bangles  apart  from  the  rest.  Suddenly,   he  was   no  longer   thinking   about  widows  or   about   repeating  his  own  father’s  collapse.  It  was  as  35  though   an  invisible  conductor  was  directing   the   pulling  of  strings  to  draw   them  together.  Whether  it  was  Murali  who   managed  to  get  introduced  to  Vani   or   the   other  way  around,   no   one  else   really  remembers.  And  they  will  never   admit   which   one  of  them   was  responsible.  And  40  yet,  it  was  this  simple:   a   friend  of  his  noticed  that  they  were  staying   near   each  other.  Perhaps   Murali   could   give  ACT-Co3   30  45  50  55  65  70  Vani  a  ride  home?  Yes,  yes,  two  heads  nodded.  They  left  the  party  they  were  at  too  quickly  to  say  all  their  good-byes.  After  the  door  closed  behind  them  the  space  where  they  had   been  was  filled  with  the  laughter  of  friends.  He  took   her  home,   She  boarded  with  a  family  in  Brooklyn.   During   the   car   ride   they   were   silent.   It   was   a  strange   and   comfortable   silence   for   two   people   who   had  waited   for   so   long   to   be   alone.   The   thrum   of   the   motor  was  loud  because  the  car  was  old,  When  they  turned  around   the   corner   he   pulled   over   and   turned   the   engine  off   and   there   was   a   quiet   as   loud   as   the   motor   had   been.  He   walked   her   to   her   door   and   she   thanked   him.   She   did  not   ask   him   in   for   a   cup   of   coffee;   it   was   not   her   house,  But   it   was   out   of   his   way   and   both   of them   knew   it.   She  forgot   that   she   did   not   like   her   teeth   and   bared   them   at  him.  Her  smile,  for  once,  was  not  self-conscious.  She  watched  him  drive  away,  waving  from  the  window.  The  Sri  Lankan  elders   of  New  York  City  were  all  too   eager   to   play   parents   to   the   couple.   She   was   Proper:  smart  and  polite  and  a  good   cook  and  lovely.  Vani  had  a  job,  and  more  important  than  any  of  these  things,  she  had  grace,  which  was  something  that  could  not  be  taught.   Murali,   of   course,   was   the   Beloved   Parentless  Boy;   their   favorite   bachelor-doctor   whom   they   took   into  their   homes   and   bosoms   and   tried   to   smother   with   wel-  come   and   curry.   Occasions   were   arranged;   even   the  very   rooms   seemed   to   conspire   to   make   the   two   end   up  next   to   each   other.   And   then   one   day   something   was  suggested   by  one  of   those  elders.  And   somehow  the  pair  of  them  were  talking  about  it.  To  each  other.  Directly.  Which   was  a  faux  pas.  But  neither  of  them  Oceans   away,   families   exploded.   True   to   form,   his  ily”  fe  ly.  But  her   family  almost  did   not   consent:   afraid   of   the   Improper,   they   questioned  his   intentions,   his   failure   to   observe   certain   formalities,  75   minded.  family’s   discord   faded   quic!  80   his   ancestry,   his   habi   and   his   character.   He   heard  about   what   they   had   said   and   turned   to   her,   his   eyes   full  of   questions,  They   may  not  know  these   things   about   you,   she  said,   but   I   do.

85   Are   you   sure?   he   asked   her.   The   unsaid:   they   may  not   forgive   you   for   this.  Positive,   she   answered.   Countries   away,   Vani's  brother   crashed   into   Murali’s   brother's   house,   yelling:  Who   is   this   doctor   who   wants   to   marry   my   sister?   Who  90   is   this   doctor   who   is   in   love   with   my   sister?  The   nerve   of   Murali,   they   thought.   In   Love?   These  were   not   words   they   were   used   to   saying.  1.   The   third   paragraph   (lines   33-46)   marks   a   shift   from  the   second   paragraph’s   focus   on   Murali’s   impressions  of   Vani   to   the   rest   of   the   passage’s   focus   on:  A.   Murali’s   life   as   a   married   man.  B.   Murali’s   concerns   about   marriage.  C.   Murali   and   Vani's   courtship   and   its   effects   on  others,  D.   Murali’s   characteristics   and   his   family   conflicts.  2.   Details   in   the   second   paragraph   (lines   9-32)   primarily  characterize   Vani   as:  F,   reserved   but   self-assured.  G.   severe   and   impolite.  H,   intelligent   and   apologetic.  J.   beautiful   but   unkempt.  3,   Which   of   the   following   events   mentioned   in   the   pas-  sage   occurred   first   chronologically?  A.   The   elders   organized   occasions   in   which   Vani   and  Murali   would   be   together.  B.   A   friend   suggested   that   Murali   drive   Vani   home.  C.   Vani   smiled   at   Murali   without   thinking   about   her  teeth.  D.   Vani's   brother   burst   into   Murali's   brother’s   home.  4.   As   it   is   presented   in   the   passage,   the   italicized   portion  How   are   you?   That's   a   beautiful   sari.   How   are   the  children?   I   like   this   rice”   (lines   20-21)   most   likely  indicates:  F.   the   types   of   pleasantries   that   Murali   would   prepare  in   his   head   before   meeting   someone   new.  G.   parts   of   a   conversation   between   Murali   and   Vani  when   they   were   first   introduced.  H.   commenis   typical   of   the   kind   that   Vani   would  make   when   in   public.  J.   secret   thoughts   that   Murali   imagined   Vani   to   be  thinking.  ACT-Co3  5.   According   to   the   passage,   one   similarity   between  Murali   and   Vani   is   that   both:  A.   enjoyed   eating   spicy   food.  B.   were   born   in   New   York   City.  C.   had   a   passion   for   cooking,  D.   worked   at   a   medical   clinic.  6.   In   the   context   of   the   passage,   the   statement   “And   they  will   never   admit   which   one   of   them   was   responsi-  ble”   (lines   38-39)   most   strongly   suggests   that:  F.   neither   Murali   nor   Vani   remembers   who   first  sought   to   be   introduced   to   the   other.  G.   each   of   Murali   and   Vani’s   friends   claims   to   have  been   the   one   who   introduced   the   two   of   them.  H.   Murali   initiated   contact   with   Vani,   though   he  would   stubbornly   deny   that   he   did   so.  J.   both   Murali   and   Vani   refuse   to   confess   to   initiating  their   introduction   to   each   other,  7.   In   the   passage,   the   narrator   makes   clear   that   Vani  didn*t   ask   Murali   in   for   coffee   because   Vani;  A.   felt   extremely   self-conscious   in   Murali’s   presence.  B.   did   not   want   to   invite   Murali   into   someone   else’s  house,  C.   assumed   that   Murali   wanted   to   get   home   at   a   rea-  sonable   hour.  D.   did   not   want   to   further   burden   Murali   with   her  requests.  8,   The   passage   indicates   that   the   description   of   Vani   in  lines   61-65   most   closely   reflects   the   perspective   of;  F,   Murali.  G.   Vani’s   family   in   Sri   Lanka.  H.   Murali’s   friends   in   New   York   City.  J.   the   Sri   Lankan   elders   in   New   York   City.  9.   It   can   reasonably   be   inferred   from   the   passage   that,   by  traditional   standards,   the   Sri   Lankan   community   would  have   considered   Murali   and   Vani's   direct   discussion   of  marriage   to   be:  A.  proper.  B..  sensible.  C.   superficial.  D.   unconventional.  10.   As   it   is   used   in   line   79,   the   word   observe   most   nearly  means:  study.  follow.  express.  perceive.  zen =

Passage   B   is   adapted   from   the   book  The  End  of  Night:  Searching  for  Natural  Darkness  in  an  Age  of  Artificial  Light  by  Paul  Bogard  (©2013  by  Paul  Bogard)  Passage   A   by   Verlyn   Klinkenborg  For  most  of  human  history,  the  phrase  “light  pollu- tion”  would  have  made  no  sense.  Imagine   walking  toward  London  on  a  moonlit  night  around  1800,  when  it  was  Earth’s  most  populous  city.  Nearly  a  million  people  lived  there,  making  do,   as  they  always  had,  with   can- dies  and  rushlights  and  torches  and  lanterns.  Only  a  few  houses   were   lit   by   gas.   and   there   would   be   no   public  gaslights  in  the  streets  or  squares  for  another   seven  years.  From  a  few  miles  away,  you  would  have   been  as  likely   to  sme//  London  as  to  see  its  dim  collective  glow.  Now  most  of  humanity  lives  under  intersecting  domes  of  reflected,  refracted  light,  of  scattering  rays  from  overlit  cities  and  suburbs,  from  light-flooded  highways  and  factories.  Nearly  all  of  nighttime  Europe  is  a  nebula  of  light,  as  is  most  of  the  United  States  and  all  of  Japan.  In  the  south  Atlantic  the  glow  from  a  single  fishing  fleet—squid   fishermen  luring  their  prey with  metal  halide  lamps—can  be  seen  from  space,  burn-  ing   brighter,   in   fact,   than   Buenos   Aires   or   Rio   de  Janeiro.  In  most  cities  the  sky   looks  as  though  it  has  been  emptied  of  stars,  leaving  behind   a  vacant  haze  that  mir-  rors   our   fear   of   the   dark.   We've   grown   so   used   to   this  pervasive  orange   haze  that  the   original  glory   of  an  unlit  night—dark   enough  for   the  planet  Venus  to  throw  shad-  ows  on   Earth—is  wholly  beyond  our  experience.  And  yet  above  the  city’s  pale  ceiling  lies  the  rest  of  the  uni-  verse,  utterly  undiminished  by  the  light  we   waste—a  bright  shoal  of  stars  and  planets  and  galaxies,  shining  in  seemingly   infinite   darkness.  We've  lit  up  the  night  as  if  it  were  an  unoccupied country,  when  nothing   could   be  further  from  the  truth.  Among  mammals  alone,  the  number  of   nocturnal species  is  astonishing.  Light  is  a  powerful  biological force,  and   on  many  species  it  acts   as  a  magnet,  a  process   being  studied  by  researchers  such  as  Travis  Longcore   and  Catherine  Rich,  The  effect  is  so  powerful  that   scientists  speak   of   songbirds  and  seabirds  being “captured”   by  searchlights  on  land   or  by  the   light  from  gas  flares  on   marine  oil  platforms,  circling  and  circling  in  the  thousands.  Passage  B   by   Paul  Bogard Unless   Vincent  Van   Gogh’s   The  Starry  Night   from  1889  is  traveling  as   part   of   an  exhibition,  it  hangs  at  home  on  its  wall  at  the  Museum  of  Modern  Art  (MoMA)   in   Manhattan   as   fifty   million   people   pass   by  every  year.  On  a  Saturday   morning  I  stand   near  Van Gogh's   scene   of  stars  and  moon  and   sleeping   town, talking   with  its  guardian  for   the   day,   Joseph,  as  he  ‘ACT-Cos  repeats,  “No  flash,  no  flash,”  “Two  feet  away,”  and  50   “Too   close,   too   close”   again   and   again   as   people   from  around   the   world   crowd   near.   “What's   the   appeal   of   this  painting?”   I   ask.   “It’s   beautiful.”   he   says,   “What   more  can   you   say   than   that?”  You  could  rightly  leave  it  at  that.  But  I  love  the  55   story   this   painting   tells,   of   a   small   dark   town,   a   few  yellow-orange   gaslights   in   house   windows,   under   a  giant   swirling   and   waving   blue-green   sky,   This   is   a  painting   of   our   world   from   before   night   had   been  pushed   back   to   the   forest   and   the   seas,   from   back   when  60   sleepy   towns   slept   without   streetlights.   People   are   too  quick,   I   think,   to   imagine   the   story   of   this   painting—  and   especially   this   sky—is   simply   that   of   “a   werewolf  of   energy,”   as   Joachim   Pissarro,   curator   at   the   MoMA  exhibition   Van   Gogh   and   the   Colors   of   the   Night,   would  65   tell   me.   While   Van   Gogh   certainly   had   his   troubles,   this  painting   looks   as   it   does   in   part   because   it’s   of   a   time  that   no   longer   exists,   a   time   when   the   night   sky   would  have   looked   a   lot   more   like   this.   Does   Van   Gogh   use   his  imagination?   Of   course,   but   this   is   an   imagined   sky  70   inspired   by   a   real   sky   of a   kind   few   of   the   fifty   million  MoMA   visitors   have   ever   seen.   It’s   an   imagined   sky  inspired   by   the   real   sky   over   a   town   much   darker   than  the   towns   we   live   in   today.   So   a   painting   of   a   night  imagined?   Sure.   But   unreal?  75   In   our   age,   yes.   But   Van   Gogh   lived   in   a   time  before   electric   light.   In   a   letter   from   the   summer   of  1888,   he   described   what   he'd   seen   while   walking   a  southern   French   beach:  The   deep   blue   sky   was   flecked   with   clouds   of   a  80   blue   deeper   than   the   fundamental   blue   of  intense  cobalt,  and  others   of  a  clearer  blue,  like  the  blue   whiteness   of  the  Milky   Way.  In  the  blue  depth  the   stars  were  sparkling,  greenish,  yellow,   white,   pink,  more  brilliant,  more  85   sparkling   gemlike   than   at   home—even   in   Paris:  opals  you   might  call  them,   emeralds,  lapis  lazuli,  rubies,  sapphires.  It’s  remarkable  to  modern  eyes,  first  of  all,  that  Van   Gogh   would   reference   the   stars   over   Paris—no   one  90   has   seen   a   sky   remotely   close   to   this   over   Paris   for   at  least   fifty   years.   But   stars   of   different   colors?   It’s   true.  Questions   11-13   ask   about   Passage   A.  11,   The   main   idea   of   the   first   paragraph   of   Passage   A   is  that:  A.   before   electricity,   it   was   difficult   to   travel   to  London  at  night.  B.   gas   lighting   existed   long   before   it   was   widely  used.  C.   light   pollution   is   a   relatively   recent   phenomenon  in   human   history.  D,   because   of   its   large   population,   London   has   had  light   pollution   for   centuries.  GO   ON   TO   THE   NEXT   PAGE.

12.   In   the   third   paragraph   of   Passage   A   (lines   21-30),   the  author   makes   a   contrast   between   the:  FE.   hazy   night   sky   over   cities   today   and   the   bright  stars   and   planets   that   exist   above   it.  gray   night   sky   over   cities   and   the   various   colors   of  the   stars.  brightness   of   the   planet   Venus   on   an   unlit   night  and   the   comparative   dimness   of   the   stars.  appreciation   that   people   once   had   for   stars   and   the  apathy   that   is   pervasive   today.  G.  H.  J  13.   It   can   reasonably   be   inferred   from   Passage   A   that   an  animal   “captured”   by   light   is   most   nearly   one   that:  A.   has   lost   the   ability   to   search   for   food   in   dark   areas.  B.   is   irresistibly   drawn   to   artificial   light   at   night.  C.   is   confined   to   limited   dark   areas   at   night.  D._   has   lost   its   natural   habitat   to   urban   expansion.  Questions   14-17   ask   about   Passage   B.  14.   Compared   to   what   Joseph   appreciates   about   The   Starry  Night,   the   author   of   Passage   B   is   more   appreciative   of  the:  F.   painting's   vivid   colors,  G.   beauty   of   the   painting.  H.   story   the   painting   tells.  J.   technique   used   in   the   painting.  15.   The   main   purpose   of   the   first   paragraph   of   Passage   B  (lines   42-53)   is   to   introduce   the   passage   by:  A.   describing   The   Starry   Night   and   providing   an   idea  of   the   painting's   popularity.  B.   conveying   the   passage   author’s   excitement   when  he   first   saw   The   Starry   Night.  C.   showing   examples   of   people's   expectations   about  The  Starry  Night  and  their  reactions  to  it.  D,   establishing   when   and   why   Van   Gogh   painted   The  Starry  Night.  16.   Based   on   Passage   B,   which   of   the   following   statements  best   summarizes   the   passage   author’s   point   about   Van  Gogh's   use   of   imagination   while   painting   The   Starry  Night?  F.   Van   Gogh   had   to   rely   heavily   on   his   imagination  because   he   usually   painted   during   the   daytime.  Van   Gogh’s   work   is   almost   entirely   imagined  because   the   painting's   stars   have   colors   that   are  unlike   actual   stars.  Van   Gogh   used   his   imagination   in   part,   but   his  painting   was   also   inspired   by   the   real   night   sky   he  observed,  Van   Gogh   barely   used   his   imagination   at   all;   he  tried   to   depict   the   vivid   night   sky   exactly   as   it   was.  G.  33  17.   As   it   is   used   in   line   90,   the   phrase   remotely   close   ta  most  nearly  means:  A.  exactly  similar  to.  B.   anything   like.  C.   anywhere   nearby,  D.   somewhat   adjacent to.  Questions   18-20   ask   about   both   passages.  18.  Which  of  the  following   statements  best  captures  the  main   difference   in   the   information   presented   in   the   two  passages?  F.   Passage   A   summarizes   the   process   by   which   light  at  night  became  common,  whereas  Passage  B  explores  one  person's  reaction  to  Van   Gogh's  The  Starry   Night.  Passage  A  offers  suggestions  for  restoring  dark-  ness  to  today’s  night,  whereas  Passage  B  compares  the  night   skies  of  several  Van  Gogh  paintings.  Passage  A  discusses  the  problems  of   today’s  bright  night  sky,  whereas  Passage  B  explains  how  people  in  Van   Gogh’s  time  used  light  at  night.  Passage  A  gives  an  overview  of  the   issue  of  light at  night,  whereas  Passage  B  examines  the  matter  of  light  at  night  through  a  discussion  of  Van  Gogh’s   The  Starry  Night.  19.   One   similarity   between   the   passages   is   that,   in   order   to  make   a   point   about   light   at   night,   both   authors   discuss:  A.  how  dark  large  cities  once  were. B.  the  opinions   of  scientific  researchers.  C.   well-known   works   of   art.  D.  personal  memories  of  when  night  was  darker.  .  Compared  to  Passage  B,  Passage  A  offers  more  infor-  mation   about  the:  F.   effects   lighting   up   the   night   sky   can   have   on  animals.  colorful  appearance  stars  had  prior  to   electric  lights.  interaction  between  nature  and  the  imagination.

HUMANITIES:  This  passage  is  adapted  from  the  essay  “On  Places,  Photographs,  and  Memory”  by  Chris  Engman  (©2012  by  Chris  Engman).  Recently  I  visited  a  place  that  I  knew  intimately  in  childhood,  a   waterfall  with  cliffs  on  both  sides  and  a  pool   of  cold  water  below,  We  used  to  jump  from  those  cliffs  despite  our  parents’  concerns.  |  loved  this  place,  5  and  revisiting  it  1  am  amazed  by  all  that  I  can  remem-  ber.  Bends  in   trails,  sap  stains  on  bark,  crooks  in  branches,  the  intricate  web  of  root   structures,  the  shape of  trees—all  are  startlingly  unchanged   and  I  remember  them   precisely.   A   small   tree   is   in   the   middle   of   the   trail.  10  I  put  my  hand  on  it  for  support  and  drops   of   moisture  fall  on  my  back  from  above,  and  I  realize:  1  have  done  this  before.  I  remember  the  sensation  precisely,   the  sound  of  rustling  leaves  above,  the  freshness  of  the  smell,   the   temperature   of   the   droplets,   the   mixture   of  15  apprehension  and  pleasure.  Standing  on  a  rock  ledge  getting   ready   to   jump,   I   reach   for   a   handhold   so   I   can  lean   over   the   edge   and   prepare   myself   for   what   I   am  about  to  do,  The  shape  of  the  rock  where  my  hand  touches   it   is   known   to   me:   I   have   performed   this   ritual.  20   Places   hold   memories   better   than   people   and   better  than  photographs.   Family,  or  people  from  our  past  who  may  remind  us  of   events  in  our  lives  and  with  whom  we  may   remi   ,   are   themselves   constantly   changing,   as  is  their  version  of  events.  Conversations  with  others  25  about  shared   experiences  of  the   past  can  seem  to  aug-  ment  memory  but   quite  often,  more  often   than  we  prob-  ably  realize.  they   operate  in  the  opposite  way:  they  alter  or  even  replace  our  own  memories  with   those  of  another.  Whatever  the   event,  one’s  memory  of  it  is  30   inevitably  altered  through  conversation;  recalling   the  same  event  at  a  later  date,  it  becomes  difficult  or  impos-  sible   to  distinguish  an  original  memory  from  the  altered  version   that   emerged.  Photographs  act  on  us  in  a  similar   fashion.  What-  35  ever  their  apparent  precision   or  correctness,  pho-  tographs   inaccurately   reflect   experience   from   the   start.  They  convert  the  three  dimensions  of   space  into  two  and   eliminate   the   third   spatial   dimension   and   time.   Also  sacrificed   are   smell,   touch,   sound,   and   context.   In   a  40  word,  a  photograph  is  an  abstraction  of   experience.  Yet  we   take   them   compulsively.   We   fill   scrapbooks   and hard  drives  with   family  outings,   vacations,  ballgames—  Scotty  in  front  of  Niagara  Falls,  Dad  and  Grandma  smiling   in   front   of   the   famous   restaurant—in   the   hope  45   of  freezing   time,  making  experience  tangible  for  future  reference,   preserving   memory.   I   do   it,   too.   But   it   is   well  to   realize   that  photographs   do  not   preserve  memory,  they   replace  memory.  Just   as  photographs  are  an abstraction   of   experience,   they   are  even  more  so   an  60   abstraction   of  memory—a  dangerously   compelling  abstraction.  Memories  are  fragile  and  impressionable.  They  cannot   hold  up  against   the  seemingly  irrefutable  factuality  of  a  photograph.  It  isn’t   that  what  is  in  a  pho-  tograph  is  false:  a  photograph’s   version   of   events   did  55   happen.   what  is  in   a  picture   did   indeed   pass   before   the  ACT-Co3  70  75  85  21.  22.  lens.   The   problem   is   that   photographs   only   tell   such   a  small   part   of   any   story.   And   while   they   may   be   techni-  cally   correct,   nonetheless   they   deceive,   Does   a   smile   in  a   photograph   mean   that   a   person   is   happy?   Or   does   it  mean   that   a   photographer   prodded,   “look   up   and  smile”?   Was   the   fish   I   caught   really   bigger   than   my  uncle's,   or   did   I   cleverly,   intentionally   hold   mine   closer  to   the   lens?   Photographs   deceive   in   another   respect.  Whatever   the   event   one   wishes   to   preserve,   snapshots  are   most   commonly   a   break   from   that   event.   The  moment   that   a   photograph   is   taken   is   experienced   as   a  moment   taking   a   photograph,   not   as   a   moment   engaged  in   the   activity   implied   by   the   resulting   image.   Time  taken   to   make   photographs   is   time   subtracted   from   the  experience   of   the   thing   being   photographed.   What   pho-  tographs   most   accurately   record,   ultimately,   is   nothing  more  than  the  act  of   photography,  itself.  To   be   sure,   photographs   can   form   a   record   of   our  lives   that   has   value,   and   I   cherish   my   old   snapshots   as  much   as   the   next   person.   But   as   image-makers   and   con-  sumers,   which   all   of   us   are   these   days,   there   is   also  value   to   be   had   in   a   recognition   of   the   limits   of   photog-  raphy   to   the   facility   of   memory—in   an   understanding  of   what   images   can   and   cannot   offer   us   in   this   regard.  Moreover   it   is   precisely   the   deceitfulness   of   photogra-  phy   as   it   pertains   to   memory   that   gives   the   medium   its  unique   platform   to   address   the   nature   of   memory   itself:  its   malleability,   its   unreliability,   its   elusiveness,   It  seems   to   me   that   no   conversation   or   photograph   can  make   memory   so   vivid   or   recognizable,   so   physically  palpable,   as   the   return   to   a   place.  The  passage  as  a  whole  can  best  be  described  as:  A.   a   summary   of   a   childhood   incident   followed   by  reflections   on   how   the   memory   of   that   incident   has  changed.  B.   a   description   of   an   experience   followed   by   consid-  eration  of  a  topic   raised  by  that  experience.  C.   an   account   of   the   author's   lifelong   interest   in   a  hobby.  D.   an   explanation   of   why   the   author's   opinions   on   a  topic   have   changed.  Which   of   the   following   statements   best   represents   the  passage’s   central   claim?  F.   The   accuracy   of   most   memories   is   improved   by  viewing   photographs  related   to  the  memories,  G.   Revisiting   a   place   evokes   clearer   and   more   accu-  rate   memories   than   conversations   or   photographs.  H.   The   truth   represented   by   a   photograph   is   only   as  accurate  as  your  memory  of  the   event  in  the  photograph.  J.   Memories   are   sustained   over   time   only   through   a  combination   of   conversations,   photographs,   and  visits   to   places.  GO   ON   TO   THE   NEXT   PAGE.

23.   The   author’s   tone   when   recounting   his   visit   to   the  waterfall   can   best   be   described   as:  A.   joking.  B.   gloomy.  C.   pleading.  D.   reverent.  24.   The   main   idea   of   the   second   paragraph   (lines   20-33)   is  the  F.   over   time,   some   memories   fade.  G.   frequently,   reminiscing   with   other   people   changes one’s  memories.  H,   reminiscing   with   other   people   helps   preserve   one’s  memories,  J.   family   members   better   evoke   one’s   memories   than  nonfamily  members.  25.   When   the   author   states   “What   photographs   most   accu-  rately   record,   ultimately.   nothing   more   than   the   act  of   photography,   itself”   (lines   70-72),   he   most   nearly  means  that:  A,   the   quality   of   a   photograph   reflects   the   skill   of   the  photographer.  B,   when   viewing   a   photograph,   people   forget   that   the  photographer   is   an   unseen   participant   in   the   scene.  C.   photographs   by   nature   are   records   of   brief  moments.  D.   photographs   tend   to   depict   people   stopping   an  activity   and   posing   for   the   photographer.  26.   It   can   most   reasonably   be   inferred   that   immediately  after   the   events   described   in   the   first   paragraph,   the  author:  F._   hikes   back   down   the   cliffs.  G.  sits  on  the  rock  ledge.  H,   jumps   into   the   water   below.  J.   takes   a   photograph   of   the   scene.  35  27.   Which   of   the   following   details   does   the   author   use   to  support   his   claim   that   photographs   don't   accurately  reflect  experiences?  A.  Photographs  are  usually  only  taken  by  adults.  B.   People   take   photographs   without   considering   the  best  way  to  photograph  an  event.  C.   Photographs   don’t   record   the   passage   of   time.  D.   The   human   eye   can   discern   more   detail   than   a   pho-  tograph  can  capture.  28.   The   information   between   the   dashes   in   lines   43-44   pri-  marily  serves  to:  F.   highlight   the   difference   between   trivial   pictures  and   meaningful   pictures.  G.   exemplify   the   kind   of   commonplace   pictures   that  people  take.  H.   point   out   the   usefulness   of   photographs   in   captur-  ing   moments   in   our   lives.  J.   list   events   from   the   author's   life   that   he   wishes   he  had   pictures   of.  29.   The   phrase   “seemingly   irrefutable   factuality”  (lines   52-53)   mainly   serves   to   emphasize   that  photographs:  A.   convey   an   impression   of   objective   truth.  B.  help  clarify   the  events   being  photographed.  C.   record   details   that   can't   be   proven.  D.   imply  a   story  beyond   what  they  actually  depict.  30.   As   it   is   used   in   line   82,   the   word   nature   most   nearly  means:  F.  temperament.  G.   essence,  H.  scenery.  J.  environment.  GO   ON   TO   THE   NEXT   PAGE.

Passage   IV  10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  50  NATURAL   SCIENCE:   This   passage   Is   adapted   from   the   article  “Reinventing   the   Leaf”   by   Antonio   Regalado   (©2010   by   Scien-  tific   American,   a   division   of   Nature   America,   Inc.).  Nathan   S.   Lewis   has   been   giving   a   lecture   on   the  energy   crisis   that   is   both   terrifying   and   exhilarating.   To  avoid   potentially   debilitating   global   warming,   the  chemist   says   civilization   must   be   able   to   generate   more  than   10   trillion   watts   of   clean,   carbon-free   energy   by  2050.   That   level   is   three   times   the   U.S.’s   average  energy   demand   of   3.2   trillion   watts.  Before   Lewis's   crowds   get   too   depressed,   he   tells  them   there   is   one   source   of   salvation:   the   sun   pours  more   energy   onto   the   earth   every   hour   than   humankind  uses   in   a   year.   But   to   be   saved,   humankind   needs   a  radical   breakthrough   in   solar-fuel   technology:   artificial  leaves   that   will   capture   solar   rays   and   churn   out   chemi-  cal   fuel   on   the   spot,   much   as   plants   do,   We   can   burn   the  fuel,   as   we   do   oil   or   natural   gas,   to   power   cars,   create  heat   or   generate   electricity,   and   we   can   store   the   fuel  for   use   when   the   sun   is   down.  Lewis’s   lab   is   one   of   several   that   are   crafting   pro-  totype   leaves,   not   much   larger   than   computer   chips,  designed   to   produce   hydrogen   fuel   from   water,   rather  than   the   glucose   fuel   that   natural   leaves   create.   Unlike  fossil   fuels,   hydrogen   burns   clean.   Other   researchers  are   working   on   competing   ideas   for   capturing   the   sun’s  energy,   such   as   algae   that   has   been   genetically   altered  to   pump   out   biofuels,   or   on   new   biological   organisms  engineered   to   excrete   oil,   All   these   approaches   are  intended   to   turn   sunlight   into   chemical   energy   that   can  be   stored,   shipped   and   easily   consumed,   Lewis   argues,  however,   that   the   man-made   leaf   option   is   the   most  likely   to   scale   up   to   the   industrial   levels   needed   to  power   civilization.  Although   a   few   lab   prototypes   have   produced  small   amounts   of   direct   solar   fuel—or   electrofuel,   as  the   chemicals   are   sometimes   called—the   technology  has   to   be   improved   so   the   fuel   can   be   manufactured   on,  a   massive   scale,   very   inexpensively.   To   power   the   U.S.,  Lewis   estimates   the   country   would   need   to   manufacture  thin,   flexible   solar-fuel   films,   instead   of   discrete   chip-  like   devices,   that   roll   off   high-speed   production   lines  the   way   newsprint   does.   The   films   would   have   to   be   as  cheap   as   wall-to-wall   carpeting   and   eventually   cover   an  area   the   size   of   South   Carolina.  Far   from   being   a   wild   dream,   direct   solar-fuel  technology   has   been   advancing   in   fits   and   starts.   ever  since   President   Jimmy   Carter's   push   for   alternative  energy   sources   during   the   1970s   oil   shocks.   Now,   with  a   new   energy   and   climate   crunch   looming.   solar   fuel   is  suddenly   gaining   attention.  In   photosynthesis,   green   leaves   use   the   energy   in  sunlight   to   rearrange   the   chemical   bonds   of   water   and  carbon   dioxide,   producing   and   storing   fuel   in   the   form  AcT-Cos  of   sugars.   “We   want   to   make   something   as   close   to   a  leaf   as   possible,”   Lewis   says,   meaning   devices   that  work   as   simply,   albeit   producing   a   different   chemical  55   output.   The   artificial   leaf   Lewis   is   designing   requires  two   principal   elements:   a   collector   that   converts   solar  energy   (photons)   into   electrical   energy   (electrons)   and  an   electrolyzer   that   uses   the   electron   energy   to   split  water   into   oxygen   and   hydrogen.   A   catalyst—a   chemi-  60   cal   or   metal—is   added   to   help   achieve   the   splitting.  Existing   photovoltaic   cells   already   create   electricity  from   sunlight,   and   electrolyzers   are   used   in   various  commercial   processes,   so   the   trick   is   marrying   the   two  into   cheap,   efficient   solar   films.  65   Bulky   prototypes   have   been   developed   just   to  demonstrate   how   the   marriage   would   work.   Engineers  at   a   Japanese   automaker,   for   example,   have   built   a   box  that   stands   taller   than   a   refrigerator   and   is   covered   with  photovoltaic   cells.   An   electrolyzer,   inside,   uses   the  70   solar   electricity   to   break   water   molecules.   The   box  releases   the   resulting   oxygen   to   the   ambient   air   and  compresses   and   stores   the   remaining   hydrogen,   which  the   automaker   would   like   to   use   to   recharge   fuel-cell  cars,  75   In   principle,   the   scheme   could   solve   global   warm-  ing:   only   sunlight   and   water   are   needed   to   create  energy,   the   by-product   is   oxygen,   and   the   exhaust   from  burning   the   hydrogen   later   in   a   fuel   cell   is   water,   The  problem   is   that   commercial   solar   cells   contain   expen-  80   sive   silicon   crystals.   And   electrolyzers   are   packed   with  platinum,   to   date   the   best   material   for   catalyzing   the  water-splitting   reaction,   but   it   costs   $1,500   an   ounce.  Lewis   calculates   that   to   meet   global   energy  demand,   future   solar-fuel   devices   would   have   to   cost  85   less   than   $1   per   square   foot   of   sun-collecting   surface  and   be   able   to   convert   10   percent   of   that   light   energy  into   chemical   fuel.   Fundamentally   new,   massively   scal-  able   technology   such   as   films   or   carpets   made   from  inexpensive   materials   are   needed.  31,   The   main   function   of   the   seventh   and   eighth   para-  graphs   (lines   65-82)   is   to:  A,   suggest   that   solar   technology   has   advanced   but  still   faces   problems   that   prevent   it   from   being   a  viable   power   source   on   a   large   scale.  B,   introduce   the   information   that   under   specific   labo-  ratory   conditions   electrolyzers   can   be   used   to  release   energy   from   water   molecules.

Four  students  observed  that  in  a  population   of  land  plants,  Population  A,  a  plant  could  have  a  green  stem  or  a  purple  stem.  Each  student  proposed  an  explanation  for  this  observation,  Student   1  All  plants  in  Population  A  produce  the  green  pigment  chlorophyll,  If  a  plant  receives  8   hr  or  more  of  sunlight  each  day,  it  also  produces  a  purple  pigment,  causing  its  stem  to  be  purple.  If   a  plant  receives  less  than  8  hr   of   sun-  light  each  day,  it  does  not  produce  this  purple  pigment,  so  its  stem  is  green.  All  plants  in  Population  A  are  genetically  identical,  so  they  all  have  the  ability  to  produce  both  pigments.  Student  2  All  plants  in  Population  A  produce  the  green  pigment  chlorophyll.  If  a  plant  receives   too  little  phosphorus  (a  nutrient),  it  also  produces  a  purple  pigment,   causing  its  stem  to  be  purple.  If   a  plant  receives  enough  phosphorus,  it  does  not  produce  this  purple  pigment,  so  its  stem  is  green.  All  plants  in  Population  A  are   genetically  identical,  so   they  all  have  the  ability  to  produce  both   pigments.  The   amount  of  sunlight  received  by  a   plant  does  not  affect  stem  color,  Student   3  All   plants  in  Population  A  produce  the  green  pigment  chlorophyll,  The  production  of  purple  pigment  is  deter-  mined  by  Gene  Q,  which  has  2  alleles  (Q  and  g)  and  3  pos-  sible  genotypes  (QQ,  Qq,  and  gq),  A  plant  with  either   the  Gene  Q  genotype  QQ  or  the  Gene  Q  genotype  Qq  produces  the  purple  pigment,   causing  its  stem  to  be  purple.  A  plant  with  the  Gene  Q  genotype  gq  does  not  produce  this  purple  pigment,  so  its  stem  is  green.  The   amount  of   sunlight   or  nutrients  received  by  a  plant  does  not  affect  stem  color.  Student   4  All   plants  in  Population  A  produce  the  green  pigment  chlorophyll.  The  production   of   purple  pigment  is  deter-  mined  by  Gene  Q,   which  has  2  alleles  (Q  and  g)  and  3  pos-  sible  genotypes  (QQ,  Qq,   and  gq).  A  plant  with  the  Gene  Q  genotype  gq  produces  the  purple  pigment,   causing  its  stem  to  be  purple.  A  plant  with  either   the  Gene  Q  genotype  OQ  or  the  Gene  Q  genotype  Qq  does  not  produce  this  purple  Pigment,  so  its  stem  is  green.  The   amount  of  sunlight   or nutrients  received  by  a  plant  does  not  affect  stem  color.  AGT-Cos  44  OG  20.  Which  student  would  be  the  most  likely  to  agree  that  the   soil   in   which   a   Population   A   plant   is   grown   will  influence   its   stem   color?  F.   Student 1  G.   Student 2  H.   Student 3  J.  Student 4  21.   Suppose   it   were   found   that   the   presence   of   the   purple  pigment  in  some  plant  tissues  protects  those  tissues  from  being  damaged  by  sunlight.  Would  this  finding  better   support   the   explanation   of   Student   I   or   the  explanation  of  Student  2?  A.  Student  I,  because  Student  1  indicated  that   the  plants  receiving  the  most  sunlight  will  have  purple  stems.  B.   Student   1,   because   Student   1   indicated   that   the  plants  receiving  the  most  sunlight  will  have  green  stems.  C.

Explanation   of   Procedures   Used   to   Obtain  Scale  Scores  from  Raw  Scores  On   each   of   the   four   tests   on   which   you   marked   any  responses,   the   total   number   of   correct   responses   yields   a   raw  score.   Use   the   table   below   to   convert   your   raw   scores   to   scale  scores.   For   each   test,   locate   and   circle   your   raw   score   or   the  range   of   raw   scores   that   includes   it   in   the   table   below.   Then,  read   across   to   either   outside   column   of   the   table   and   circle   the  scale   score   that   corresponds   to   that   raw   score.   As   you  determine   your   scale   scores,   enter   them   in   the   blanks   provided  on   the   right.   The   highest   possible   scale   score   for   each   test   is  36.   The   lowest   possible   scale   score   for   any   test   on   which   you  marked  any  responses  is   1.  Next,   compute   the   Composite   score   by   averaging   the   four  scale   scores,   To   do   this,   add   your   four   scale   scores   and   divide  the   sum   by   4.   If   the   resulting   number   ends   in   a   fraction,   round   it  off   to   the   nearest   whole   number.   (Round   down   any   fraction   less  than   one-half;   round   up   any   fraction   that   is   one-half   or   more.)  Enter   this   number   in   the   blank.   This   is   your   Composite   score.  The   highest   possible   Composite   score   is   36.

This   booklet   contains   tests   in   English,   mathematics,  reading,   and   science.   These   tests   measure   skills   and  abilities   highly   related   to   high   school   course   work   and  success   in   college,   Calculators   may   be   used   on   the  mathematics   test   only.  The   questions   in   each   test   are   numbered,   and   the  suggested   answers   for   each   question   are   lettered.   On  the   answer   document,   the   rows   of   ovals   are   numbered  to   match   the   questions,   and   the   ovals   in   each   row   are  lettered   to   correspond   to   the   suggested   answers.  For   each   question,   first   decide   which   answer   is   best.  Next,   locate   on   the   answer   document   the   row   of   ovals  numbered   the   same   as   the   question.   Then,   locate   the  oval   in   that   row   lettered   the   same   as   your   answer.  Finally,   fill   in   the   oval   completely.   Use   a   soft   lead   pencil  and   make   your   marks   heavy   and   black.   Do   not   use   ink  or   a   mechanical   pencil.  Mark   only   one   answer   to   each   question.   If   you   change  your   mind   about   an   answer,   erase   your   first   mark  thoroughly   before   marking   your   new   answer.   For   each  question,   make   certain   that   you   mark   in   the   row   of   ovals  with   the   same   number   as   the   question.  ACT  Only   responses   marked   on   your   answer   document  will   be   scored.   Your   score   on   each   test   will   be   based   only  on   the   number   of   questions   you   answer   correctly   during  the   time   allowed   for   that   test.   You   will   not   be   penalized  for   guessing.   It   is   to   your   advantage   to   answer   every  question   even   if   you   must   guess.  You   may   work   on   each   test   only   when   the   testing  staff   tells   you   to   do   so.   If   you   finish   a   test   before   time   is  called   for   that   test,   you   should   use   the   time   remaining   to  reconsider   questions   you   are   uncertain   about   in   that   test.  You   may   not   look   back   to   a   test   on   which   time   has  already   been   called,   and   you   may   not   go   ahead   to  another   test.   To   do   so   will   disqualify   you   from   the  examination.  .   Lay   your   pencil   down   immediately   when   time   is   called  at   the   end   of   each   test.   You   may   not   for   any   reason   fill  in   or   alter   ovals   for   a   test   after   time   is   called   for   that   test  To   do   so   will   disqualify   you   from   the   examination.  Do   not   fold   or   tear   the   pages   of   your   test   booklet.  DO   NOT   OPEN   THIS   BOOKLET  UNTIL   TOLD   TO   DO   SO.  PO   BOX   168  IOWA   CITY,   lA   52243-0168
