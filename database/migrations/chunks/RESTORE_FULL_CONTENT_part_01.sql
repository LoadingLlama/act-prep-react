The ACT consists of four required sections—English, Math, Reading, and Science—plus an optional Writing section. This lesson will give you a complete overview of the test format, teach you how scores work, and provide strategic insights to help you maximize your performance on test day. </p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 1. Test Structure and Format </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The ACT is a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">standardized test</strong> used by colleges for admissions decisions. Unlike the SAT, the ACT tests more straightforward knowledge and has a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Science section</strong>. The test is divided into four required sections and one optional section, with a total testing time of about 3 hours (or 3.5 hours with Writing). </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> English Section: 45 Minutes, 75 Questions </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">English section</strong> tests grammar, punctuation, sentence structure, and rhetorical skills across five passages. You''ll have approximately 45 seconds per question. Questions test conventions of standard English (grammar and usage), production of writing (strategy and organization), and knowledge of language (style and tone). This section appears first on the test, so starting strong is crucial for building confidence. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Math Section: 60 Minutes, 60 Questions </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Math section</strong> covers pre-algebra, elementary algebra, intermediate algebra, coordinate geometry, plane geometry, and trigonometry. You have one minute per question on average. A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">reference sheet</strong> with basic formulas is provided, but memorizing key formulas will save time. Calculators are permitted (and highly recommended) for this entire section. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Reading Section: 35 Minutes, 40 Questions </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Reading section</strong> includes four passages: Prose Fiction/Literary Narrative, Social Science, Humanities, and Natural Science. Each passage has 10 questions. You''ll have about 8 minutes and 45 seconds per passage, so time management is critical. Questions test your ability to determine main ideas, locate details, understand sequences, make comparisons, comprehend cause-effect relationships, determine word meaning, and analyze author''s voice and method. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Science Section: 35 Minutes, 40 Questions </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Science section</strong> tests interpretation, analysis, evaluation, reasoning, and problem-solving skills through data representation, research summaries, and conflicting viewpoints passages. Don''t worry—you don''t need advanced science knowledge! The section primarily tests your ability to read graphs, charts, and tables, and apply scientific reasoning. Most students find this section challenging due to the pace (about 53 seconds per question). </p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 2. Scoring System and What Scores Mean </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Understanding how the ACT is scored helps you set realistic goals and track your progress. The ACT uses a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">scaled scoring system</strong> from 1-36, and there''s <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">no penalty for wrong answers</strong>, so you should always guess if you''re running out of time. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> How Scores Are Calculated </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Each section (English, Math, Reading, Science) receives a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">scaled score</strong> from 1-36 based on the number of questions you answer correctly (your <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">raw score</strong>). These four section scores are then averaged to create your <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Composite Score</strong>, which is the most important number for college admissions. The composite is rounded to the nearest whole number—for example, if your four section scores are 28, 30, 26, and 32, your composite is (28+30+26+32)/4 = 29. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> What''s a Good Score? </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The national average composite score is around <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">20-21</strong>. A score of 24 puts you in approximately the 75th percentile, meaning you scored higher than 75% of test-takers. Competitive colleges typically want scores above 27, while highly selective schools (Ivy League, top liberal arts colleges) generally expect 32-36. However, "good" depends on your target schools—research the average ACT scores for admitted students at colleges you''re interested in. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Subscores and STEM Score </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> In addition to section scores, you''ll receive <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">subscores</strong> (1-18 scale) for specific skill areas like "Production of Writing" in English or "Integrating Essential Skills" in Math. You''ll also see a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">STEM score</strong>, which averages your Math and Science scores. While colleges primarily focus on your composite and individual section scores, subscores can help identify specific areas for improvement. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Superscoring </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Many colleges practice <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">superscoring</strong>, which means they take your highest section scores across multiple test dates and recalculate a new composite. For example, if you score English 28, Math 30, Reading 25, Science 27 on Test 1, then English 26, Math 32, Reading 28, Science 26 on Test 2, your superscore would combine the best from each: 28, 32, 28, 27 = composite 28.75, rounded to 29. Check whether your target colleges superscore—this policy encourages retaking the ACT to improve individual sections. </p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 3. General Test-Taking Strategies </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Success on the ACT requires more than content knowledge—you need effective <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">time management</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">strategic guessing</strong>, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">stress management</strong> skills. These universal strategies apply across all four sections. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Always Answer Every Question </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The ACT has <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">no guessing penalty</strong>—wrong answers don''t count against you. This means you should NEVER leave a question blank. If you''re running out of time, quickly bubble in an answer for every remaining question. Statistically, random guessing gives you about a 20-25% chance of being correct, which is better than 0%! </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Pace Yourself and Use a Watch </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Time pressure is one of the ACT''s biggest challenges. Wear a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">watch</strong> (analog watches are best since digital devices aren''t allowed) and set checkpoints. For example, in Reading, you should finish passage 1 by minute 8, passage 2 by minute 17, passage 3 by minute 26, and passage 4 by minute 35. Don''t spend too long on any single question—if you''re stuck after 30-45 seconds, make your best guess, circle it in the test booklet, and move on. You can return if time permits. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Answer Easy Questions First </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Not all questions are created equal. Some are straightforward, while others require complex reasoning. Within each section, scan for <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"quick points"</strong>—questions you can answer confidently in 20-30 seconds. Rack up these easy points first, then tackle harder questions with your remaining time. This strategy maximizes your score even if time runs out. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Process of Elimination </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> When you''re unsure of the correct answer, use <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">process of elimination</strong>. Cross out answers you know are wrong in your test booklet, then guess among remaining choices. Eliminating even one wrong answer improves your odds from 20% to 25% (for 4-choice questions) or 25% to 33% (for 3-choice questions). Often you can <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Cross out wrong answer choices">eliminate</span> 2-3 choices, giving you a strong chance of guessing correctly. </p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 4. Test Day Preparation and Logistics </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Your performance on test day depends not only on preparation but also on practical considerations like what to bring, how to manage stress, and what to expect at the testing center. Being well-prepared logistically helps you focus entirely on the test itself. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> What to Bring </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Mandatory items: your <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">admission ticket</strong> (printed from your ACT account) and an acceptable <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">photo ID</strong> (school ID, driver''s license, or passport). Recommended items: several sharpened No. 2 pencils with erasers, an approved <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">calculator</strong> with fresh batteries, a watch (not a smartwatch), snacks and water for breaks, and layered clothing in case the room is too hot or cold. Do NOT bring: cell phones, smartwatches, prohibited calculators, reference materials, or scratch paper (you can use the test booklet). </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Night Before and Morning Of </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The night before: review a few key formulas or grammar rules, but don''t cram—it''s more important to get <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">8 hours of sleep</strong>. Pack your backpack with everything you''ll need. Set multiple alarms. The morning of: eat a substantial, protein-rich breakfast (avoid sugary foods that cause energy crashes). Arrive at the test center by 7:45 AM for an 8:00 AM start—latecomers aren''t admitted. Use the bathroom before testing begins, as breaks are limited. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Managing Test Anxiety </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Feeling nervous is normal, but excessive <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">test anxiety</strong> can hurt your performance. Practice <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">deep breathing</strong> techniques: inhale slowly for 4 counts, hold for 4 counts, exhale for 4 counts. During the test, if you feel overwhelmed, close your eyes for 10 seconds, take a deep breath, and refocus. Remember: you can retake the ACT—this one test doesn''t define you. Confidence comes from preparation, so thorough practice with realistic timed tests is your best defense against anxiety. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> After the Test </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Scores are typically released 2-8 weeks after your test date (check your ACT account for the exact release date). You can send your scores to colleges for free on test day (list up to 4 schools), or pay later to send additional score reports. Many students take the ACT 2-3 times to improve their composite score—each attempt gives you new experience and insights. Review your score report carefully to identify weak areas, then create a targeted study plan for your next attempt. </p> <p style="height: 1px; margin: 0; padding: 0;"></p><h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700; visibility: hidden; height: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0; overflow: hidden;">.</h3><h3 style="color: #2e7d32; font-size: 1.4rem; font-weight: 700; margin: 3rem 0 1.5rem 0;"> Key Takeaways </h3> <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>The ACT has four sections: English (45 min, 75 Q), Math (60 min, 60 Q), Reading (35 min, 40 Q), Science (35 min, 40 Q)</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Scores range from 1-36 per section; your Composite is the average of all four sections</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>There''s no guessing penalty—ALWAYS answer every question, even if you have to guess</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Time management is crucial: use a watch, set checkpoints, and don''t spend too long on any question</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Many colleges superscore—taking the ACT multiple times can improve your composite</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Test day essentials: admission ticket, photo ID, No. 2 pencils, approved calculator, watch</li> </ul></body></html>')

1. Clauses, Phrases, and Fragments
</h3>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Independent Clauses
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">An <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">independent clause</strong> can stand as a sentence by itself
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Always has a subject and a verb</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read the sentence out loud—if you can stop talking at the end, it''s an independent clause</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Examples: "The dog chased its tail" / "He picked it up"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">dependent clause</strong> cannot stand alone as a complete sentence
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Most often created by adding a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">subordinating conjunction</strong> to the front</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Common subordinating conjunctions: after, although, as, because, before, even though, if, in order to, once, since, that, though, unless, until, when, whenever, where, whether, while, whatever</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Examples: "While the dog chased its tail..." / "Because he picked it up..."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">How to identify: If you feel like you need to keep talking after reading it, it''s dependent
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cover the first word and read the rest—if it becomes a complete sentence, the original was a dependent clause</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If it''s still incomplete after covering the first word, it''s a phrase</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Phrases
</h4>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Does not express a complete thought and can never stand alone</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Provides additional descriptive information in a sentence</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Examples: "Chasing its tail..." / "Excited to open up his present..."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">All missing the subject—we don''t know who is doing the action</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Sentence Fragments
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">sentence fragment</strong> is missing a subject or verb or both
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cannot stand by itself as a complete sentence</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Usually sounds plain wrong when you read it aloud</li>

2. Five Types of Compound Sentences
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">On the ACT, multiple clauses must always appear as one of these 5 types
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The ACT tests these rules constantly—memorize all 5!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Answer choices that "sound good" but break these rules are wrong</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Type 1: Two Separate Independent Clauses with Periods
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Structure: Independent clause + <strong>period</strong> + Independent clause
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Mary loves dogs. Andrew loves cats."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Type 2: Comma + FANBOYS Joining 2 Independent Clauses
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">

How to Identify Sentence Structure Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Punctuation variations in answer choices
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Periods, semicolons, commas, and FANBOYS appear in different positions</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you see these variations, it''s a sentence structure question</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Subject or verb forms vary between choices
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">One choice says "drove" while another says "driving"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Some choices have subjects/verbs, others don''t</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Watch for comma splices in these questions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Three-Step Approach to Sentence Structure Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Find where the sentence is being "split"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for the punctuation point in the underlined portion</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Look left and right of the split point
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Identify whether each side is independent, dependent, or a phrase</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read each side separately to test if it can stand alone</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Apply the sentence structure rules
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use the 5 compound sentence types to determine the correct answer</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Eliminate choices that break the rules</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. The Four Types of Commas
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The ACT tests exactly 4 comma rules—master these and you''ll handle every comma question
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Each type has a specific purpose and can''t be substituted with another</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Understanding when to use each type is critical for avoiding comma errors</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Type 1: Comma + FANBOYS
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Use a comma and a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">FANBOYS</strong> word to join two independent clauses
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">FANBOYS</strong> = For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "My alarm clock did not go off this morning, so I arrived late at school"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both sides must be independent clauses (complete sentences)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Type 2: Dependent Clause Followed by Independent Clause
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When a dependent clause comes before an independent clause, use a comma to separate them
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "While electronic music has become very popular, many people still prefer classic rock"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The dependent clause starts with subordinating conjunctions like while, although, because, if</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is from Chapter 1''s Rule #4 for compound sentences</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Type 3: Unnecessary Information
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Commas separate <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">unnecessary information</strong> from the rest of the sentence
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Information is unnecessary if you can remove it without fundamentally changing the sentence''s meaning</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Unnecessary information can be as short as one word or as long as a lengthy phrase</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Mrs. Ellison, who is known for giving pop quizzes, is my least favorite teacher"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The basketball team, though, did not mount a comeback this week"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Type 4: Listing
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Use commas when listing more than two items or with multiple adjectives modifying the same noun
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example with list: "The group ordered coconut shrimp, hot wings, and onion rings"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example with adjectives: "The old, limping dog still managed to complete the 3-mile hike"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use commas between all items in a series, including before the final "and" or "or"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- Example 1 will be inserted here by ExampleCard component -->
<!-- Database: position=1, lesson_id=[UUID], shown AFTER teaching concept -->

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Unnecessary Information Commas
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The most common comma type on the ACT separates unnecessary information
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Information is unnecessary if removing it doesn''t fundamentally change the sentence''s meaning</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Unnecessary information can appear before a comma, after a comma, or between two commas</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">After removing unnecessary information, what remains must still be a complete sentence</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
The "Crossing-Out" Trick
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">To test if information is unnecessary, cross it out and read what remains
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the sentence is still complete and makes sense, the information is unnecessary</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the sentence becomes incomplete or loses critical meaning, the information is necessary (no commas)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The wooden beam, set at an angle, created an optical illusion"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cross out "set at an angle" → "The wooden beam created an optical illusion" (still complete!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Necessary vs. Unnecessary Information
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Determining if information is truly unnecessary requires careful reading
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Correct (necessary): "The dresses that need to be hemmed are hanging in the closet"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Without "that need to be hemmed," we don''t know which specific dresses</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Correct (unnecessary): "Judith, who went to fashion school, designs dresses for a living"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">We already know who designs dresses (Judith), so the fashion school detail is extra</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
The Names Rule
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The ACT loves testing comma usage with names—you''ll see at least one question on this
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the identifier is NOT specific to one person (friend, teacher, physicist), the name is necessary—no commas</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "My friend Kelly recently moved to London" (I have multiple friends, so Kelly is necessary)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the identifier IS specific to one person (best friend, youngest sister, CEO), the name is unnecessary—use commas</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "My best friend, Andrew, is a certified scuba diver" (I have only one best friend)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
"That" vs. "Which" Phrases
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Phrases starting with <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">that</strong> never get commas—phrases starting with <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">which</strong> always get commas
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"That" phrases are always necessary information</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The dogs that live down the street are always barking"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Which" phrases are always unnecessary information</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "My neighbor''s dogs, which are always barking, love to play fetch"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Exception: Prepositional phrases like "on which," "in which," or "of which" don''t use commas before them</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
"ing" and "ed" Phrases
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Participle phrases</strong> starting with "ing" or "ed" may or may not need commas
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">On the ACT, "ing" and "ed" phrases most commonly appear with commas as unnecessary information</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Excited for the car ride, Jane''s bulldog started to jump up and down"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Marcus applied for the internship, hoping that he would get the position"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the phrase helps specify which noun, it''s necessary (no commas)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The politician waving to the crowd is predicted to win the election"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Prepositional Phrases
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Prepositional phrases</strong> consist of a preposition and its object
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Common prepositions: in, of, to, for, with, on, at, from, by, about, as, into, like, through, after, over, between, during, before, among, around</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Prepositional phrases at the FRONT of a sentence are always followed by a comma</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "On my way to work, I listened to my new favorite podcast"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Prepositional phrases in the MIDDLE or END almost never have commas (99% of the time)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The clothing on the bed is for vacation"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">They contain essential information specifying which noun you''re talking about</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Transitional words</strong> (also called conjunctive adverbs) require specific punctuation
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Common transitional words: however, though, therefore, instead, likewise, nevertheless, regardless, moreover, subsequently, furthermore, in addition, as a result, of course, otherwise, for example</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These are NOT FANBOYS—they require different punctuation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Three Ways to Punctuate Transitional Words
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Position 1:</strong> At the front of the sentence followed by a comma
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "However, the truth would not be revealed until next week"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "As a result, the student was sent to the principal''s office"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This treats the transitional word as unnecessary information you can cross out</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Position 2:</strong> Separated by commas in the middle of a sentence
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The truth, however, would not be revealed until next week"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The student, as a result, was sent to the principal''s office"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Again, treat as unnecessary information between two commas</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Position 3:</strong> Separated by a semicolon and comma when between two independent clauses
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "I expected to pay over $100 for my new hiking boots; however, I found a sale and got them for half price"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Structure: Independent clause + semicolon + transitional word + comma + Independent clause</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">CRITICAL: You need BOTH the semicolon (before) AND the comma (after) the transitional word</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

4. Spotting Unnecessary Information Comma Questions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Unnecessary information comma questions have two defining characteristics
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The words in all 4 answer choices are exactly the same</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The only difference is where commas are located</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When you see this pattern, immediately use the "crossing-out" trick</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
How to Approach These Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Read the entire sentence carefully
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pay attention to any commas NOT in the underlined portion</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These fixed commas are often important clues for finding the correct answer</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look out for sentence structure rules from Chapter 1 that may also apply</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Use the crossing-out trick systematically
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Test each answer choice by crossing out what the comma(s) would separate</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The correct answer leaves a complete, grammatical sentence after crossing out</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
The Pauses and Commas Backup Trick
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Read the sentence out loud (or "out loud" in your head on test day)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you need to take a short pause for a breath, you likely need a comma</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is a backup method—always verify with the crossing-out trick first</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Natural pauses often correspond to where unnecessary information appears</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Use the "crossing-out" trick for unnecessary information commas—if you can remove the information and still have a complete sentence, it''s unnecessary and needs commas to separate it
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>"That" phrases never get commas while "which" phrases always get commas—for names, use commas only when the identifier is specific to one person (best friend, CEO) but not for general identifiers (friend, teacher)

    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Transitional words like "however" require specific punctuation: at the front with a comma after, in the middle between two commas, or between independent clauses with a semicolon before and comma after

1. Semicolons
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The most important rule: A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">semicolon</strong> can replace a period
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both sides of the semicolon must be independent clauses (complete sentences)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you can replace the semicolon with a period and both halves make sense as separate sentences, the semicolon is correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "My boss called me; he asked that I pick up coffee for him."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Common semicolon errors to avoid
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "My boss called me; asking that I pick up coffee for him." (second half is not an independent clause)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "After my boss called me; he asked that I pick up coffee for him." (first half is not an independent clause)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "My boss called me, he asked that I pick up coffee for him." (this is a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">comma splice</strong>—cannot connect two independent clauses with just a comma)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The test: Replace the semicolon with a period
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If both halves stand alone as complete sentences, the semicolon is correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If either half cannot stand alone, the semicolon is wrong</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

2. Colons
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">colon</strong> introduces a list, an example, an explanation, a clarification, or a definition
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">List of multiple items: "I went to the grocery store to pick up some items for dinner: chicken, cheese, and onions."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">List of one item: "I went to the market to get lunch: a turkey sandwich."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example or explanation: "He got what he deserved: a one-week suspension without pay."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Clarification: "Chocolate milk is a great recovery drink after a hard workout: it has the carbohydrates and proteins that muscles need to recover."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Three Critical Colon Rules
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Rule 1: The part before the colon must be an independent clause
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The part before the colon must be a complete sentence by itself</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "The slide showing the most popular car colors in 2018: white, gray, and black."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "The slide shows the most popular car colors in 2018: white, gray, and black."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "The hairstylist excelled in: cuts, coloring, and highlights."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "The hairstylist excelled in cuts, coloring, and highlights." (no colon needed)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Rule 2: Everything after the colon must be only the list, example, explanation, clarification, or definition
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The sentence cannot continue to other topics after the colon</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "Will brought his lunch to the beach: a roast beef sandwich, and he brought his friend Joey a turkey club."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "Will brought his lunch to the beach: a roast beef sandwich. He brought his friend Joey a turkey club."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Rule 3: NEVER use colons with "including," "such as," or "for example"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you see a colon before OR after these phrases, it is always incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "I went to the grocery store to pick up some items for dinner, including: chicken, cheese, and onions."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "I went to the grocery store to pick up some items for dinner: including chicken, cheese, and onions."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "I went to the grocery store to pick up some items for dinner, including chicken, cheese, and onions." (use a comma instead)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "The study relied on techniques such as: direct observation and surveying."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "The study relied on techniques such as direct observation and surveying." (no comma or colon needed)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Advanced: Colons Joining Two Independent Clauses
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">A colon can join two independent clauses if the second clause acts as a definition, example, explanation, or clarification of the first
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Buddy got what he worked for: he really deserved that promotion."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "My father gave me one rule to live by: honesty is always the best policy."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is an advanced grammar rule that rarely appears on the ACT</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Dashes
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Dashes</strong> can function like unnecessary information commas, parentheses, or colons
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Most commonly, a pair of dashes sets apart unnecessary information in the middle of a sentence</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Think of dashes as a stronger, more dramatic version of commas or parentheses</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Pair of Dashes for Unnecessary Information
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Two dashes function exactly like unnecessary information commas
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Residents of Washington D.C. - the capital of the United States - are still trying to get representation in Congress."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Glazed donuts - even if they are unhealthy - are my favorite."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">CRITICAL: You cannot mix punctuation!
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Must be a pair of commas, a pair of dashes, OR a pair of parentheses</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "Deep-dish pizza - a famous meal in Chicago, does not exist in Italy." (mixing dash and comma)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "Deep-dish pizza, a famous meal in Chicago, does not exist in Italy." (pair of commas)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "Deep-dish pizza - a famous meal in Chicago - does not exist in Italy." (pair of dashes)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "Deep-dish pizza (a famous meal in Chicago) does not exist in Italy." (pair of parentheses)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Single Dash Acting Like a Colon
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">A single dash can introduce a list, example, explanation, definition, or clarification
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When acting as a colon, the dash must follow the same 3 colon rules</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "You will need the following ingredients - milk, butter, flour, and eggs."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "In order to establish his dominance, the male lion relied on one thing - his thunderous roar."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The study declared that the results were conclusive - mice will complete the maze faster if they are given soda instead of water."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Advanced: Single Dash Like Parentheses
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">A single dash in the middle of a sentence can separate information at the end just like parentheses
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "After three weeks, the patient was fed up with his doctor''s plan (or lack of a plan)."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "After three weeks, the patient was fed up with his doctor''s plan - or lack of a plan."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This rule has been very rarely tested on the ACT English Test</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

4. Apostrophes
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Apostrophes</strong> on the ACT have two functions: possession and contractions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Most apostrophe questions test whether you can identify the correct possessive form</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Other questions test whether you can distinguish between possessive pronouns and contractions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Possession Rules
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For singular nouns: Add apostrophe + "s"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Terrence''s bike is much faster than my brother''s roller blades."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For singular words ending in "s" (like "bus"): You can add apostrophe + "s" OR just an apostrophe (both are correct)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The bus''s driver" OR "The bus'' driver"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For plural nouns ending in "s": Add apostrophe after the "s"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The boys'' jerseys were all covered in mud after the game."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For plural nouns NOT ending in "s": Add apostrophe + "s"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Our women''s basketball team won the championship last year."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Possessive vs. Plural
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The ACT tests whether you can distinguish between singular possessive, plural possessive, and non-possessive plural
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Singular possessive: "I accidentally stepped on the dog''s bone." (one dog possessing the bone)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Plural possessive: "The dogs'' collars are in the basket by the door." (multiple dogs possessing collars)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Non-possessive plural: "I watched as the dogs played in the yard." (multiple dogs, but no possession)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The trick: Check if the next word is being possessed
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the noun owns or possesses something, use an apostrophe</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If there''s no possession, don''t use an apostrophe</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Possessive Pronouns vs. Contractions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Possessive pronouns</strong> (its, hers, yours, ours, theirs) end in "s" but NEVER use an apostrophe
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: its, hers, yours, ours, theirs</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: it''s (contraction for "it is"), her''s, your''s, our''s, their''s</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Contractions</strong> use an apostrophe to show where letters are removed
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"it''s" = "it is" (contraction)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"you''re" = "you are" (contraction)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"they''re" = "they are" (contraction)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"who''s" = "who is" (contraction)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The plug-in test: Expand the contraction and see if it makes sense
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The cat loves playing with (its/it''s) new toy."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Test: "The cat loves playing with it is new toy." ❌ This doesn''t work!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Answer: "The cat loves playing with its new toy." ✓ Correct (possessive pronoun)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Quotation marks</strong> are most commonly used for direct quotes
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">They can also be used to show a word is being used as a technical term, slang, or in an unusual way</li>

</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Direct Quotes That Are Spoken
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Direct quotes that are spoken are offset by a comma
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Anytime the quote is being spoken (said, yelled, whispered, exclaimed, etc.), use a comma before or after the quotation</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Abigail said, ''I will not pay until the painting is completed.''"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "''The thunderstorm last night woke me up,'' Paul whispered."</li>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the quote is just a phrase or part of the sentence (not being actively spoken), there is no punctuation before the quotation marks</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "My grandfather described the shells as, ''beautiful souvenirs from a past life.''"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "My grandfather described the shells as ''beautiful souvenirs from a past life.''"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The quotation marks show these are the grandfather''s words, but he''s not actively speaking them in the scene</li>

  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Semicolons can replace periods—both sides must be independent clauses (complete sentences). Colons introduce lists, examples, explanations, or definitions, but the part before the colon must always be an independent clause, and you can never use colons with "including," "such as," or "for example."
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Dashes can function like unnecessary information commas or parentheses when used in pairs, and like colons when used as a single dash. Never mix punctuation—use a pair of commas, a pair of dashes, or a pair of parentheses, but never combine them.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Apostrophes show possession (add apostrophe + "s" for singular nouns, apostrophe after "s" for plural nouns ending in "s") or contractions. Possessive pronouns like "its," "yours," and "theirs" never take apostrophes, while contractions like "it''s" (it is), "you''re" (you are), and "they''re" (they are) always do.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Quotation marks are used for direct quotes (with a comma if spoken, no comma if not spoken) and to show technical terms, slang, or unusual usage. When the quote is actively being said, yelled, or whispered, use a comma to offset it from the speaker tag.

1. Subject-Verb Agreement Basics
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong> is the person, place, or thing doing the action
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Usually at the beginning of the sentence</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Cats love to sit in empty boxes." (subject = "Cats")</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The subject must agree with the verb in number
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the subject is singular, the verb must be singular</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the subject is plural, the verb must be plural</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "My dog barks at the mailman every day." (singular subject "dog" → singular verb "barks")</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Three Ways the ACT Tricks You
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Trick #1: Unnecessary information phrases between subject and verb
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Unnecessary information phrases NEVER contain the subject</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cross out unnecessary information to find the subject</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Tortoises, known to live to over 150 years old, are sold at the local pet shop."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cross out "known to live to over 150 years old" → Subject is "Tortoises" (plural) → verb is "are" (plural)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Trick #2: Prepositional phrases between subject and verb (MOST COMMON)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Prepositional phrases</strong> NEVER contain the subject or verb</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cross out prepositional phrases (like "of students," "in the park," "on the table") to find the subject</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The entire group of students is organizing a bake sale to raise money."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cross out "of students" → Subject is "group" (singular) → verb is "is" (singular)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The pod of dolphins hunts as a team."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cross out "of dolphins" → Subject is "pod" (singular) → verb is "hunts" (singular)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Trick #3: Group nouns that sound plural but are singular
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Group nouns</strong> (class, committee, team, herd, jury, etc.) are SINGULAR even though the group consists of more than one person or thing</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The sheep herd waits to be sheared." (herd = singular)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The jury agrees that the defendant deserves to be put in jail." (jury = singular)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Helpful Tricks
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Read the subject and verb side-by-side
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Once you find the subject and verb, read them next to each other and ignore the information in between</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "A large percentage of the voters, many of whom are under the age of 30, prefers the new housing proposal."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cross out unnecessary phrases → "A percentage prefers the new housing proposal."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Now it''s clear: "percentage" (singular) → "prefers" (singular)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Plug in "he/she/it" for singular subjects and "they" for plural subjects
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sometimes it''s difficult to "hear" which verb matches the subject</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For singular words, plug in "he," "she," or "it"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For plural words, plug in "they"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The exact time for the meeting with the softball coach and location for the showcase have not been finalized."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cross out prepositional phrases → Subjects are "time" and "location" (plural)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Replace with "they" → "They (has/have) not been finalized."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Now it''s obvious: "have" is correct</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

2. Verb Tense
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For verb tense questions, trust your ear
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">As a native English speaker, you''ll know what sounds right or wrong</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read for context by looking at the previous sentence(s) and finding other verbs</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Match the tense in the rest of the paragraph</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Do NOT pick a complicated tense when a simple tense works
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Avoid unnecessary complicated forms (has run, had ran, had been running, would have run) when simple tenses work</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Last year, Margot designed a new line of summer dresses." (simple past tense, not "was designing")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Before he votes tomorrow, Dale will research each candidate''s positions on the major issues." (simple future tense)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Perfect Tense (has/have/had + verb)
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Use <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">perfect tense</strong> when there are multiple timelines in a sentence
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Perfect tense = "has," "have," or "had" + verb</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Many surfers enjoy paddling out, but few have ridden waves over ten feet tall."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "While the group of entrepreneurs claimed to all be successful, only a few have started their own businesses."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The bison had been eating when the lions began their attack." (shows the bison were already eating before the attack started)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "By the beginning of next year, the doctors will have finished their preliminary research on lung cancer."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Conditional Tense (would/could)
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Conditional tense</strong> describes what would or could happen
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The verb conjugation depends on how likely the outcome is (probable, improbable, impossible)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Probable: "If I make the free throw, we will win the game."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Improbable: "If I made the free throw, we would win the game."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Impossible (past): "If I had made the free throw, we would have won the game."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Trust your ear and go with what sounds right</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Irregular Verbs
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Irregular verbs</strong> don''t follow normal patterns
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Trust your ear and go with what sounds correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Before the show began, the lights were dimmed." (not "begun")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The deliveryman had rung the doorbell before dropping off the package." (not "rang")</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The "a" vs. "u" rule for irregular verbs
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Many irregular verbs have an "a" version (swam, began, drank) and a "u" version (swum, begun, drunk)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">With "has," "have," or "had" (perfect tense) → Use the "u" version</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Before you arrived, I had swum some laps." (perfect tense → "swum")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">With no "has," "have," or "had" (past tense) → Use the "a" version</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "I swam some laps this morning." (past tense → "swam")</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

3. Common Irregular Verbs
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The most commonly tested irregular verbs on the ACT
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">begin → began (past tense) → has/have/had begun (perfect tense)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">drink → drank (past tense) → has/have/had drunk (perfect tense)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">sink → sank (past tense) → has/have/had sunk (perfect tense)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">swim → swam (past tense) → has/have/had swum (perfect tense)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">run → ran (past tense) → has/have/had run (perfect tense)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">sing → sang (past tense) → has/have/had sung (perfect tense)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Remember the pattern
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Past tense (no helping verb) = "a" version</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Perfect tense (with has/have/had) = "u" version</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This pattern applies to begin, drink, sink, swim, and sing</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Note: "run" is irregular—both versions are "run" (I ran, I have run)</li>
    </ul>

4. How to Spot Subject-Verb Agreement vs. Verb Tense Questions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Both question types show different forms of the same verb in answer choices
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You need to know which type you''re dealing with to answer correctly</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The answer choices tell you what''s being tested</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Subject-Verb Agreement Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Look for singular and plural versions of verbs in the answer choices
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for "is" vs. "are"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for "has" vs. "have"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for "was" vs. "were"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for any verb with singular (like "runs") vs. plural (like "run")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Anytime you see singular and plural versions, the question is testing subject-verb agreement</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"The addition of solar panels to the roof of a house in Nevada makes the house on average 20% more energy efficient."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Answer choices: make (NO CHANGE), makes, have made, were making</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Subject = "addition" (singular) → verb must be "makes" (singular)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Even though there are different tenses, we only need subject-verb agreement to find the answer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Verb Tense Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Look for different tenses in the answer choices
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For example: "requires" (present), "required" (past), "will require" (future)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Check that answer choices do NOT have singular and plural versions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If there are no options for singular vs. plural, subject-verb agreement is not being tested</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The question is testing verb tense only</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"The girl scouts are hosting a bake sale tomorrow to raise money. To get ready, Adya needs to bake two trays of blondies and a box of donut holes."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Answer choices: would need (NO CHANGE), was needing, needed, needs</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Previous sentence uses "are" (present tense), so this sentence should be present tense too</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Answer: "needs" (present tense)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Key Takeaways
</h3>

<ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>For subject-verb agreement, find the subject by crossing out unnecessary information phrases and prepositional phrases (which never contain the subject). The subject must match the verb in number—singular subjects take singular verbs, plural subjects take plural verbs. Watch out for group nouns (team, committee, herd) which are always singular.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Use the "plug-in" trick for subject-verb agreement: replace singular subjects with "he/she/it" and plural subjects with "they" to easily hear which verb sounds correct. Read the subject and verb side-by-side, ignoring everything in between.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>For verb tense questions, trust your ear and read for context by looking at other verbs in the paragraph. Use perfect tense (has/have/had + verb) for multiple timelines, conditional tense (would/could) for hypothetical situations, and remember the "a" vs. "u" rule for irregular verbs: use "a" versions (swam, began, drank) for past tense without helping verbs, and "u" versions (swum, begun, drunk) with has/have/had.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Identify question type by looking at answer choices: if you see singular vs. plural versions ("is" vs. "are," "has" vs. "have," "runs" vs. "run"), it''s testing subject-verb agreement. If you see different tenses without singular/plural options, it''s testing verb tense. This tells you which strategy to use.

1. Pronoun Case: Subject vs. Object
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Pronouns</strong> are words that stand in for a person, place, or thing
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pronouns have two cases: subject and object</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The pronoun''s role in the sentence (subject or object) dictates which type is correct</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Subject Pronouns vs. Object Pronouns
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Subject pronouns</strong> (I, we, you, he, she, it, they, who) are used when the pronoun is doing the action
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "They went to the street festival on Saturday afternoon."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Object pronouns</strong> (me, us, you, him, her, it, them, whom) are used when the pronoun is receiving the action
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The man handed us a stack of flyers."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For simple pronoun case questions, trust your ear</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Pronouns in a List
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Pronouns in lists are tricky because we often say them incorrectly in conversation
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Ignore the other items in the list and just read the pronoun by itself to tell which is correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The policeman asked to speak to my friends and me."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Test: "The policeman asked to speak to me." ✓ (not "speak to I")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "His girlfriend and he went to the hockey game."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Test: "He went to the hockey game." ✓ (not "him went")</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Pronouns in Prepositional Phrases
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Pronouns in prepositional phrases are ALWAYS in the object case
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This rule can be difficult to hear by ear alone, so remember it</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The bet between Joe and me was for just five dollars." (not "between Joe and I")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "To whom was the award given?" (not "to who")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Jerry claims that a great rivalry exists among Tim, Scott, and him." (not "among...and he")</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Who vs. Whom
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The difference between "who" and "whom" is tested on almost every ACT
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Technically, "who" is the subject and "whom" is the object</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">But here''s the trick you need to memorize:</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The he/him replacement trick
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you can replace the word with "he," "she," or "they" → use "who"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you can replace the word with "him," "her," or "them" → use "whom"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You may need to rearrange the sentence, but this trick works for any who vs. whom question</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Examples
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Who stole the apple off the teacher''s desk?" → Test: "He stole the apple" ✓ → Use "who"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"To whom should I address this letter?" → Test: "I should address this letter to him" ✓ → Use "whom"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Who do you want to win the Bachelor?" → Test: "You want him to win" ✓ → Actually "whom" is correct here!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Who vs. Whom in Descriptive Phrases
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">On difficult questions, who/whom can introduce a phrase describing a person
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The normal "he/him" trick doesn''t work if you look at the entire sentence</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Instead, look only at the phrase itself</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: "The child whom I invited to the party was very noisy."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look only at the phrase: "whom I invited to the party"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Test: "I invited him to the party" ✓ → Use "whom"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: "The child who was running down the street was very noisy."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look only at the phrase: "who was running down the street"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Test: "He was running down the street" ✓ → Use "who"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Quick trick: Look at the word right after "who" or "whom"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the word right after is a verb → use "who"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the word right after is a noun → use "whom"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Reflexive Pronouns (myself, yourself, himself...)
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Reflexive pronouns</strong> use the "-self" ending and can only be used when the pronoun refers back to a person or thing elsewhere in the sentence
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "I grabbed three donuts and put them in a box for myself." (refers back to "I")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "I asked my coworker to put three donuts in a box for myself." ("myself" doesn''t work because the subject is "my coworker," not "I")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "I asked my coworker to put three donuts in a box for me."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

2. Possessive Pronouns
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Possessive pronouns</strong> show ownership
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These pronouns must match with the word(s) they''re replacing</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">They come in two forms: possessive nouns and possessive adjectives</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Possessive Nouns vs. Possessive Adjectives
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Possessive nouns stand alone: mine, ours, yours, his, hers, its, theirs
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "That book is mine." (stands alone, not followed by a noun)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Possessive adjectives come before a noun: my, our, your, his, her, its, their
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "That is my book." (comes before the noun "book")</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Matching Possessive Pronouns to the Antecedent
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Possessive pronouns must match the word they''re replacing in number (singular vs. plural)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "The entire team went on stage to pick up their trophy."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The pronoun refers back to "team," which is singular (remember: group nouns are singular!)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "The entire team went on stage to pick up its trophy."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">More examples
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Emmanuel and James came back home after forgetting their phones." (plural subjects → "their")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Thousands of tourists travel to Egypt each year to see its ancient pyramids." (Egypt is singular → "its")</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

3. Pronoun Agreement
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Pronouns must agree with the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">antecedent</strong>, which is the noun the pronoun is replacing
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Whenever you see a pronoun on the ACT, find exactly who or what it''s referring to</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The antecedent can be in the same sentence or in a preceding sentence</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The antecedent can appear anywhere (unnecessary information, prepositional phrases, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Matching in Plurality
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">A singular antecedent must have a singular pronoun; a plural antecedent must have a plural pronoun
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "Each attendee at the party raised their drink for a toast."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Each attendee" is singular → pronoun must be singular</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "Each attendee at the party raised his or her drink for a toast."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Also correct: "The guests at the party raised their drinks for a toast." (plural → plural)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Matching in Gender
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">A male antecedent must have a male pronoun; a female antecedent must have a female pronoun
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Jane and Sarah, after a long conversation with another group of hikers on the trail, said they were too tired to go any farther today."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Jane and Sarah" (female, plural) → "they" (plural, works for any gender)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Common Tricky Cases
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Watch out for singular words that seem plural
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Each member of the women''s track team improved her time." ("each member" is singular → "her")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"A person who is committed to his or her dreams can achieve them." ("a person" is singular → "his or her")</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

4. Ambiguous Pronouns
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For a pronoun to be correct, we must know exactly who or what it''s referring to
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If we don''t know exactly who or what a pronoun is referring to, the pronoun is <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ambiguous</strong> and is always incorrect</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Examples of Ambiguous Pronouns
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Ambiguous "he"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "Stephen smiled at his father as he threw the ball."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">We don''t know if "he" refers to Stephen or his father, so "he" is ambiguous</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "Stephen smiled at his father as his father threw the ball."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Even though it seems redundant, replacing "he" with "his father" fixes the error</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Ambiguous "some"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "Even though the order had not yet shown up, the librarian insisted that she had ordered some."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">We have no idea what "some" refers to</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "Even though the order had not yet shown up, the librarian insisted that she had ordered four copies of the new book."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Spotting Ambiguous Pronouns Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Anytime you see a pronoun in the answer choices, check if it''s ambiguous
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pronouns to watch for: he, him, his, she, her, hers, they, them, their, it, its, this, that, these, those, some, none</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Look for answer choices that replace the pronoun with a specific noun
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The correct answer often specifies exactly what or who is being referred to</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Instead of "he is the most famous," the answer might be "Biggie is the most famous"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Instead of "asked for one," the answer might be "asked for a slider"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Use subject pronouns (I, we, he, she, they, who) when the pronoun does the action, and object pronouns (me, us, him, her, them, whom) when it receives the action. For pronouns in lists, ignore the other items and read the pronoun alone. Pronouns in prepositional phrases are always object case. For "who" vs. "whom," replace with "he/him"—if "he" works, use "who"; if "him" works, use "whom."
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Possessive pronouns must match the word they''re replacing in number. Remember that group nouns (team, committee, class) are singular and take singular possessive pronouns like "its," not "their."
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Pronouns must agree with their antecedent (the noun they''re replacing) in both plurality and gender. A singular antecedent needs a singular pronoun; a plural antecedent needs a plural pronoun. Watch out for singular words like "each," "every," and "a person" that require singular pronouns.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Ambiguous pronouns are always incorrect. If you can''t tell exactly who or what a pronoun refers to, it''s ambiguous. The correct answer will replace the ambiguous pronoun with a specific noun. Watch for pronouns like he, she, they, it, this, that, some, and one in answer choices—they''re often ambiguous and need to be replaced with specific nouns.

1. What is a Misplaced Modifier?
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">misplaced modifier</strong> is a word, phrase, or clause that is improperly separated from the noun it modifies
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This leads to a sentence with an incorrect or unintended meaning</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Misplaced modifiers are hard to spot because we usually know what the sentence is really supposed to be saying</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example of a Misplaced Modifier
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "Consistently erupting, Jack loves taking pictures of the Old Faithful geyser at Yellowstone National Park."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">What''s wrong? The modifier "consistently erupting" is supposed to modify the Old Faithful geyser, but instead it''s modifying Jack!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This sentence suggests Jack is consistently erupting (which doesn''t make sense)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When a sentence begins with a modifying phrase, the phrase must modify the very first noun that follows the comma</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
How to Fix Misplaced Modifiers
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Option 1: Put the modifier right next to what it''s describing
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "Consistently erupting, the Old Faithful geyser at Yellowstone National Park is one of Jack''s favorite things to take pictures of."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Now "consistently erupting" is right next to "the Old Faithful geyser"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Option 2: Change the modifier from a phrase to a dependent clause
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "Since it is consistently erupting, Jack loves taking pictures of the Old Faithful geyser at Yellowstone National Park."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Adding "it is" changes the modifier to a dependent clause, making it clear the geyser is erupting</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
The "Next-Door Neighbor" Rule
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For a modifier to be properly placed, it must be right "next-door" to the noun it''s describing
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Modifiers can be at the beginning, middle, or end of a sentence</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">If the modifier is at the beginning of the sentence, the first noun after it must be the word being modified
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Running from the police, Eric hopped the fence and hid underneath a car."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Running from the police" modifies "Eric" (the first noun after the comma)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">If the modifier is in the middle or end of the sentence, it must be modifying the noun directly before it
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Dr. Anderson, a world-renowned surgeon, fixed my broken leg."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"A world-renowned surgeon" modifies "Dr. Anderson" (the noun directly before it)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

2. Front of the Sentence Modifiers with a Comma
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">On the ACT, most misplaced modifier questions have a modifier at the front of the sentence separated by a comma
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For this type of question, consider who or what the modifier is describing</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Then make sure that person, place, or thing is the first noun in the rest of the sentence</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example: Front Modifier Error
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "Not popular since the early 1980s, the documentary about mullets explored the origins of the wildly popular hairstyle."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The modifier is "not popular since the early 1980s"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">What is "not popular since the early 1980s"? Mullets, not documentaries!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">But the first noun after the comma is "documentary," which is wrong</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">✓ Correct: "Not popular since the early 1980s, mullets were the topic of a recently released documentary."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Now "mullets" (the thing that''s not popular since the 1980s) is the first noun after the comma</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The modifier is right "next-door" to what it describes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Strategy for Front Modifiers
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 1: Identify the modifying phrase at the beginning (before the comma)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for descriptive phrases before the first comma</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 2: Ask yourself: Who or what is being described by this modifier?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Think about what noun makes logical sense with the description</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 3: Find the first noun after the comma
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is what the modifier is currently describing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 4: Make sure the first noun matches who or what should be described
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If it doesn''t match, the modifier is misplaced</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Choose the answer that puts the correct noun first</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- Example 2 will be inserted here by ExampleCard component -->

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Middle or End of the Sentence Modifiers with Commas
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">A modifier in the middle or at the end of the sentence must be directly after whoever or whatever it is modifying
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These modifiers are often set off by commas or use "which" or "that"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example: Middle Modifier Error
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "The research team, which arrived at their nesting grounds early this year, tracked the movements of the blue storks."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The modifier is "which arrived at their nesting grounds early this year"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is placed right after "research team," so it''s describing the research team</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">But the blue storks (not the research team) arrived at their nesting grounds early!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
How to Fix Middle/End Modifiers
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Option 1: Move the modifier to be right after what it describes
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "The research team tracked the movements of the blue storks, which arrived at their nesting grounds early this year."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Now the modifier is right after "blue storks"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Option 2: Change the modifier to describe what''s actually before it
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "The research team, which tracked the movement of the blue storks, noted that the birds arrived at their nesting grounds early."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Now the modifier correctly describes the research team</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Strategy for Middle/End Modifiers
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 1: Identify the modifying phrase (often with "which," "that," or set off by commas)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for descriptive phrases in the middle or end of the sentence</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 2: Ask: What noun is the modifier describing?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Think logically about what makes sense</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 3: Check what noun comes right before the modifier
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is what the modifier is currently describing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 4: Make sure the noun before the modifier is what should be described
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If not, choose the answer that moves the modifier or changes the sentence structure</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

4. Modifiers without Commas
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">In some questions, the modifier will not be separated by any commas
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These are harder to spot, but the "next-door neighbor" rule still applies</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Keep an eye out for phrases starting with "that" or words ending in "-ing" and "-ed"</li>
    </ul>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Words ending in "-ing" (present participles)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The dog chasing the cat ran into the street."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Chasing the cat" modifies "dog" (right before it)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "Chasing the cat, the street was where the dog ran."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This suggests the street is chasing the cat!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>A misplaced modifier is a word, phrase, or clause that is improperly separated from the noun it modifies, leading to a sentence with an incorrect or unintended meaning. Use the "next-door neighbor" rule: modifiers must be right next to the nouns they describe.

These descriptive phrases must be right next to the nouns they modify, whether at the beginning, middle, or end of the sentence.

1. What is Parallel Structure?
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Parallel structure</strong> is the repetition of a chosen grammatical form within a sentence as items are listed or compared
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The items in a list can be words, phrases, or clauses</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Whenever we see items in a list or a comparison between items, we must make sure they have parallel structure</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Items in any list must be written with the same grammatical form
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Items must be all nouns, all verbs, all adjectives, etc.</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When lists are written with proper parallel structure, the sentence flows more smoothly and sounds better</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Many students can "hear" which answer choice is correct without even realizing they''re being tested on parallel structure</li>
    </ul>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "To protect her fragile hands, Julia will not rake the leaves, wash the dishes, and has decided she will not take out the trash."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">List items: "rake the leaves" (verb phrase), "wash the dishes" (verb phrase), "has decided she will not take out the trash" (clause)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Not parallel! The third item is much longer and has a different structure</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">✓ Correct: "To protect her fragile hands, Julia will not rake the leaves, wash the dishes, or take out the trash."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">All three items are now verb phrases: "rake," "wash," "take out"</li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">No matter how simple or complex the items in the list are, they must be parallel
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Lists can contain nouns, verb phrases, adjectives, or entire clauses</li>

</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Lists of 3 or more items are easier to spot
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You will be able to more obviously "hear" which answer choice is correct or incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "She made her bed, cleaned the shelves, and swept the floor" (all past tense verbs)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Lists of 2 are more difficult to spot and can trick you
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">They can often sound good even if they''re not parallel</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Be extra aware of parallel structure anytime you see a list of 2 on the ACT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "It''s harder to lift the couch by myself than lifting it with some friends."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "It''s harder to lift the couch by myself than to lift it with some friends." (both use "to lift")</li>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">In addition to lists, there are certain special cases for parallel structure
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These are officially called <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">correlative conjunctions</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">They must have the same grammatical structure for both parts of the conjunction</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
The Four Main Correlative Conjunctions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Neither ___ nor ___
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The news report is neither accurate nor fair."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both blanks must have the same form (both adjectives here)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Either ___ or ___
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "You can either call me or text me."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both blanks must match (both verb phrases here)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Not only ___ but also ___
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is the most commonly tested correlative conjunction on the ACT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "My mother not only took away my keys but also locked them in the safe."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both blanks must match (both verb phrases here)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Both ___ and ___
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Both a scholar and an athlete, Sylvia got a scholarship to row crew in college."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both blanks must match (both noun phrases here)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
How to Check Parallel Structure with Correlative Conjunctions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Identify what comes immediately after the first part of the conjunction
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">What type of word or phrase follows "not only," "either," "neither," or "both"?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Check what comes immediately after the second part
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">What type of word or phrase follows "but also," "or," "nor," or "and"?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Make sure both parts match in grammatical form
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the first part has a verb phrase, the second must have a verb phrase</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the first part has a noun, the second must have a noun</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Lists connected by "and" or "or"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Comparisons using "than"</li>

Strategy for Parallel Structure Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 1: Identify that there''s a list or comparison
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for words like "and," "or," "than," or correlative conjunctions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 2: Find all the items in the list or comparison
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">How many items are there? What are they?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 3: Check the grammatical form of each item
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Is the first item a noun? Verb? Adjective? Phrase? Clause?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Are all the other items the same type?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 4: Choose the answer that makes all items match
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">All items must have the same grammatical structure</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Trust your ear—parallel structure usually "sounds right"</li>
    </ul>

2. Than vs. Then

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Than</strong> is ONLY used for comparisons
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "I think that chocolate with almonds is much better than ice cream."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Then</strong> has multiple meanings
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Used when dealing with time: "First we eat, then we clean up."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Means "in addition to": "I need to call my mother, and then we can leave."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Used with if/then statements: "If it rains, then we''ll stay inside."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Quick rule: For a comparison, use "than." Otherwise, use "then."</li>

3. Have vs. Of
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Many people mistakenly use "could of" or "would of"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is ALWAYS incorrect!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The correct forms are "could have" or "would have"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The words "could," "should," "would," and "might" should always be followed by "have," not "of"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The reason for this mistake: The contraction "could''ve" (short for "could have") is pronounced like "could of"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "If we left the show earlier, we could of avoided the traffic."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "If we left the show earlier, we could have avoided the traffic."</li>

</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For COUNTABLE nouns, use: number, many, fewer, few
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The number of ingredients" (you can count ingredients)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "How many trophies" (you can count trophies)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Fewer calories" (you can count calories)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "A few minutes" (you can count minutes)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For NON-COUNTABLE nouns, use: amount, much, less, little
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The amount of time" (you can''t count time itself)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "How much significance" (you can''t count significance)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Less whole milk" (you can''t count milk itself, only containers)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "A little time" (you can''t count time itself)</li>

5. Active Voice vs. Passive Voice
</h3>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Active voice</strong> means the subject performs the verb''s action
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "I picked up the pencil." (I performed the action)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The police chief announced the list of suspects." (The police chief performed the action)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Passive voice</strong> means the subject is acted upon by the verb
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The pencil was picked up by me." (The pencil didn''t do the action)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The list of suspects was announced by the police chief." (The list didn''t do the action)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">On the ACT, NEVER select an answer choice in passive voice
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Active voice is always better than passive voice</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Active voice is clearer, more direct, and stronger</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

6. Prepositional Idioms
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Idioms</strong> are expressions stated in a certain way because it''s widely accepted practice
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Certain words must be paired with certain prepositions to be correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These questions don''t come up often on the ACT</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When prepositional idioms appear, rely on what sounds best
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "Bobby was afraid by the dark."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "Bobby was afraid of the dark."</li>

  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>"Affect" is a verb (to produce a change), while "effect" is a noun (the result of a change). "Than" is only for comparisons, while "then" is for time sequences or if/then statements. Always use "could have" not "could of"—the same applies to should, would, and might.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>For countable nouns (things you can count), use number, many, fewer, and few. For non-countable nouns (things you can''t count in plural form), use amount, much, less, and little. For example: "fewer calories" but "less milk."
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Active voice (where the subject performs the action) is always better than passive voice (where the subject is acted upon) on the ACT. Choose "I picked up the pencil" over "The pencil was picked up by me."
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Prepositional idioms pair specific words with specific prepositions (like "afraid of" not "afraid by"). These questions are rare—when they appear, trust what sounds right. Don''t try to memorize every idiom; focus on mastering other topics first.

Watch for these combinations: </p> <div style="border-left: 4px solid #f59e0b; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; background-color: #fffbeb;"> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Comma + Verb Agreement:</strong> Prepositional phrase between subject and verb, with comma placement <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Modifier + Pronoun:</strong> Dangling modifier where the pronoun reference is ambiguous <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Parallel + Verb Tense:</strong> List items with inconsistent verb forms </p> </div> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 2. Systematic Error Recognition Strategies </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Develop a consistent approach to every grammar question. This systematic method prevents you from missing errors and helps you work efficiently under time pressure. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Step 1: Read the Sentence Completely </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Always read from the beginning of the sentence (or previous sentence if needed) through the end. Context matters—you can''t identify tense errors, pronoun agreement, or modifier placement without understanding the full sentence. </p> <div style="border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; background-color: #f8fafc;"> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Why this matters:</strong> Many errors depend on elements outside the underlined portion. Subject-verb agreement requires finding the subject (often not underlined). Verb tense requires checking surrounding verbs. Pronoun clarity requires seeing the antecedent. </p> </div> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Step 2: Trust Your Ear, But Verify with Rules </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> If something sounds wrong, it probably is. However, some errors sound correct (like "everyone...their"), so verify with the rules you''ve learned. </p> <div style="border-left: 4px solid #16a34a; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; background-color: #f0fdf4;"> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Ear + Rules = Accuracy</strong> → If it sounds wrong: Identify which rule is violated → If it sounds right: Still check the Big 7 categories systematically </p> </div> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Step 3: Eliminate Obviously Wrong Answers </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Use process of elimination to narrow choices before identifying the specific error. </p> <div style="border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; background-color: #f8fafc;"> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Common eliminators:</strong> </p> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> • Creates a fragment or run-on • Uses wrong verb tense for the context • Creates pronoun agreement error • Breaks parallel structure in a list • Makes the sentence significantly more wordy without adding clarity </p> </div> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Step 4: Look for Visual Cues </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Certain patterns in the answer choices tell you what the question is testing. </p> <div style="border-left: 4px solid #f59e0b; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; background-color: #fffbeb;"> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Different punctuation marks?</strong> → Punctuation question <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Different verb forms?</strong> → Verb agreement or tense <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Different pronouns?</strong> → Pronoun agreement or case <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Sentence restructured?</strong> → Modifier placement or sentence structure <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Different word order in list?</strong> → Parallel structure </p> </div> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 3. Time Management and Pacing </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The ACT English section gives you 45 minutes for 75 questions across 5 passages.

If the shorter version creates an error or changes meaning, choose the longer correct option. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Avoid Extreme or Absolute Language </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> On rhetorical questions about adding/deleting information or main ideas, be wary of answer choices with extreme words like "always," "never," "only," "completely." </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Read Answer Choices Carefully </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The ACT loves to include answer choices that look similar but differ in one key detail. Read every word of each choice. </p> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Common trap:</strong> Three choices are identical except one uses "affects" and another uses "effects."

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Redundancy, wordiness, and irrelevance questions appear frequently on the ACT English Test. For these questions, the shortest and simplest answer choice that expresses the same idea is almost always correct—if anything is redundant, wordy, or irrelevant, eliminate it.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. Redundancy
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Redundancy</strong> occurs when information is unnecessarily repeated
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read the sentence itself AND the sentence(s) before to check for repeated information</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If two words or phrases mean the same thing, one must be removed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Common redundant phrases to watch for
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ "Returned back" → ✓ "Returned" (returning already means coming back)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ "In the Swedish forests" when Sweden was already mentioned → ✓ "In the forests"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ "Past history" → ✓ "History" (history is always past)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ "Free gift" → ✓ "Gift" (gifts are free by definition)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example: Context-Based Redundancy
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "In Sweden, there are about 300,000 to 400,000 moose, many of which stand over seven feet tall, roaming freely in the Swedish forests."</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">✓ Correct: "In Sweden, there are about 300,000 to 400,000 moose, many of which stand over 7 feet tall, roaming freely in the forests."</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Why: The sentence already specifies the moose are in Sweden, so "Swedish" is redundant</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Wordiness
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Sentences can be unnecessarily wordy without being redundant
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pick the answer choice that uses the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">fewest words</strong> to express the same idea</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Eliminate flowery or unnecessarily complex language</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Common wordy phrases and their concise alternatives
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ "Due to the fact that" → ✓ "Because"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ "At this point in time" → ✓ "Now"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ "In the event that" → ✓ "If"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ "A cultural institution supporting intellectual endeavors related to renaissance art" → ✓ "A museum devoted to renaissance art"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example: Simplifying Wordy Phrases
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "The ancient Italian sculptures were donated to a cultural institution supporting intellectual endeavors related to renaissance art."</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">✓ Correct: "The ancient Italian sculptures were donated to a museum devoted to renaissance art."</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Why: The simpler version conveys the exact same meaning with far fewer words</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Irrelevance
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Irrelevant information</strong> doesn''t contribute to the passage''s main idea or current paragraph
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Irrelevant details most often appear as long, wordy answer choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These answer choices are always incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Ask: Does this information help tell the story or explain the concept?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example: Removing Irrelevant Details
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "To win the game, Ricky needed to make both free throws. Players are not allowed to step in the lane during a free throw attempt. He made the first one. The entire gym was quiet as he stepped to the line for the second."</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">✓ Correct: "To win the game, Ricky needed to make both free throws. He made the first one. The entire gym was quiet as he stepped to the line for the second."</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Why: The rule about stepping in the lane is irrelevant to Ricky''s specific free throw situation</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. How to Spot These Questions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The ACT directly tells you when testing redundancy, wordiness, or irrelevance
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for questions asking: "Which choice is the least redundant in context?"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Or: "Which choice best avoids wordiness and redundancy in context?"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When you see these questions, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">the shortest answer is almost always correct</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Important warning: ONLY use "shortest is correct" for these specific questions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">On grammar questions (not asking about redundancy), the shortest answer may be wrong</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: An ambiguous pronoun like "it" or "them" might be shortest but incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Always apply grammar rules first unless the question specifically asks about redundancy</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Recognizing Ambiguous Pronouns
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Even though pronouns are short, they''re incorrect if ambiguous
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Watch for: they, them, it, this, that, these, those, some, none</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you can''t tell exactly what the pronoun refers to, it''s incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Freddie ordered some" is ambiguous—some what? Coral? Aquariums?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Correct: "Freddie ordered some coral colonies" clearly specifies what he ordered</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="visibility: hidden; margin: 0; padding: 0; line-height: 0; height: 0;">
Hidden Separator
</h3>

<h3 style="color: #2e7d32; font-size: 1.4rem; font-weight: 700; margin: 3rem 0 1.5rem 0;">
Key Takeaways
</h3>

<ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Redundancy occurs when information is unnecessarily repeated—check the current sentence and previous sentences for duplicate information. Common examples: "returned back" (just "returned"), "Swedish forests" when Sweden was already mentioned (just "the forests").
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Wordiness means using more words than necessary to express an idea. Pick the answer choice with the fewest words that conveys the same meaning: "because" instead of "due to the fact that," "museum" instead of "cultural institution supporting intellectual endeavors."
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Irrelevant information doesn''t contribute to the passage''s main idea or current paragraph—these details often appear as long, wordy answer choices and are always incorrect. Ask yourself: does this information help tell the story or explain the concept?
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>The ACT directly asks "Which choice is the least redundant in context?" or "Which choice best avoids wordiness?" For THESE questions only, the shortest answer is almost always correct. However, on grammar questions, don''t always pick the shortest—ambiguous pronouns (it, them, some) may be short but incorrect.

2. How to Approach Word Choice Questions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Follow this three-step process
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Step 1:</strong> Read the sentence and surrounding sentences for context</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Step 2:</strong> Plug each word into the sentence one at a time</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Step 3:</strong> Pick the word that makes the most sense in context</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Context includes both meaning and tone
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Does the word''s definition fit logically?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Does the word''s formality level match the passage?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Does it create the intended relationship between ideas?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example Approach
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Question: "Adding solar panels to your house can <u>emit</u> huge savings on energy bills."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A. emit</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">B. claim</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">C. gift</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">D. result in</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Analysis
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Emit" means to send out or release—doesn''t fit with savings</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Claim" means to assert or demand—doesn''t make sense here</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Gift" is a noun, not a verb that fits this context</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Result in" means to cause or produce—this fits perfectly!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The answer is D because "result in" is the only phrase that logically completes the meaning</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Vocabulary Strategy
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Don''t assume the hardest word is correct
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sometimes the ACT includes challenging vocabulary you need to know</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Other times, challenging words are incorrect answer choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The difficulty level of the word doesn''t indicate if it''s right or wrong</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">What to do when you don''t know a word
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you know a word works, pick it—even if it seems easy</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Eliminate words you know are wrong</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you don''t know a word and have to guess, make your best guess and move on</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t spend too much time on vocabulary you don''t know</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Trust What You Know
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Your instinct about common words is usually correct
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If a simple word like "make" or "show" fits perfectly, it''s likely correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t overthink or assume you need a fancier word</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The ACT values precision and clarity, not complexity</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Common Word Choice Patterns
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Similar-sounding words with different meanings
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Affect (verb - to influence) vs. Effect (noun - result)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Elicit (to draw out) vs. Illicit (illegal)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Complement (to complete) vs. Compliment (to praise)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Words with similar meanings but different connotations
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Dispassionate (unemotional) vs. Disinterested (unbiased) vs. Unbiased (neutral)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Display (to show) vs. Reveal (to uncover) vs. Exhibit (to demonstrate)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Context determines which shade of meaning is correct</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Phrasal verbs and preposition choices
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Improved over" vs. "improved upon" vs. "improved above"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The correct preposition changes the meaning</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Trust what sounds natural in standard English</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Transition questions test your reading comprehension by asking you to select the word or phrase that best connects ideas between sentences. All answer choices will be grammatically correct, so you must read for context to determine which transition logically relates the ideas.

  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Context is everything
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You cannot determine the correct transition by reading only one sentence</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Always read both the previous and following sentences</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Type 1: All Four Choices Are Transitions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When all 4 answer choices are transitions, you''re only being tested on selecting the correct one
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read for context to understand the relationship</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Match the transition to the logical connection between ideas</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">"From a distance, the ocean looked pretty calm today even though a storm had arrived last night. <u>Under the circumstances,</u> the scene was much more chaotic with big waves and strong riptides."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A. NO CHANGE (Under the circumstances)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">B. For instance</li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">✓ Correct: C. "Up close" creates a contrast with "from a distance" in the previous sentence</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Type 2: Three Transitions and One "No Transition" Option
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When one choice has <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">no transition</strong>, the ACT is asking whether a transition is even necessary
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Most often, the correct answer is the one that removes the transition entirely</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Only use a transition if it properly links the sentences</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the ideas flow naturally without a transition, choose the "no transition" option</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
When to Remove Transitions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Remove the transition if:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The sentences are simply continuing the same idea</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The relationship is already clear without a transition word</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Adding a transition makes the connection awkward or incorrect</li>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Adding or deleting information questions ask whether specific information should be included in a passage or not. For these questions, you must read for context—we recommend reading the entire paragraph where the question appears to determine if the information fits.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. How to Approach These Questions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Read the paragraph <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">twice</strong>: once with the information included and once with it deleted
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This makes it clear whether the information should be included</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Consider: Does the information fit the paragraph''s focus?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Depending on the question, you may need to read more than one paragraph</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Context is critical
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You must understand what the paragraph is discussing</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The information should support or relate to the main idea</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Adding Information Questions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">These questions give you a sentence or phrase and ask if it should be added
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Answer choices have two parts: (1) Yes or No, (2) Justification why</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">First decide yes or no, then pick the correct justification</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Critical Strategy: Only Consider What the Sentence Says
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When evaluating justifications, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">only consider the sentence being added</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Many students pick justifications that go far beyond what the sentence says</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t include details that have nothing to do with the sentence itself</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The justification must accurately describe what that specific sentence provides</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example Structure
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Question: "Should the writer add this sentence about Dr. Anderson''s education?"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A. Yes, because it establishes Dr. Paul''s mentor''s qualifications</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">B. Yes, because it indicates Dr. Anderson had a top-notch education</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">C. No, because it does not indicate where Dr. Paul studied</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">D. No, because it is not relevant to the passage''s discussion of Dr. Paul''s career</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">If the passage is about Dr. Paul''s career, not his mentor''s, the answer is D</li>
</ul>

3. Deleting Information Questions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">These ask if <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">existing information should be removed</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Same format: Yes/No + Justification</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Consider whether the information is relevant and necessary</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
When to Delete Information
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Delete when the information:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Is irrelevant to the paragraph''s main idea</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Repeats information already stated</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Distracts from the paragraph''s focus</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Doesn''t add anything meaningful</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Keep when the information:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Supports the main idea</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Provides necessary detail or clarification</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Connects ideas within the paragraph</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Common Answer Choice Patterns
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Good justifications are <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">specific and accurate</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">They describe exactly what the sentence provides</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">They relate to the paragraph''s focus</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "provides specific detail about the location" (if the sentence actually does that)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Bad justifications are vague or go too far
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">They claim the sentence says more than it actually does</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">They focus on irrelevant details</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "proves the scientist was the best in his field" (when sentence only mentions one achievement)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Common Wrong Answer Traps
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Watch out for justifications that:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Reference information NOT in the sentence being added/deleted</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Make logical leaps beyond what the sentence states</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Focus on the wrong person, topic, or idea</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use absolute language ("proves," "always," "never") when the sentence is less definitive</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

Logical placement questions ask you to place a sentence in the paragraph based on context and logical flow. These questions test your ability to recognize where information fits best by reading the sentences before and after each potential placement spot.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. How to Identify These Questions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Logical placement questions are easy to spot because they always ask <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">where to place a sentence</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Common phrasing: "For the sake of logic and coherence, Sentence X should be placed..."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Or: "The sentence would most logically be placed..."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Look for <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">bracketed numbers [1] [2] [3]</strong> at the beginning of sentences
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Bracketed numbers only appear when there''s a logical placement question</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read these paragraphs more carefully—they may currently be out of order</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The paragraph may seem confusing at first because sentences are misplaced</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Bracketed letters [A] [B] [C] appear for end-of-passage placement questions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t worry about the letters while reading—just note there will be a placement question</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The question will ask where to place a new sentence in the passage</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

2. The Critical Strategy: Plug and Read
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">To find the correct answer, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">plug the sentence into each potential spot</strong> and re-read
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t just read the sentence before the placement—this is the most common mistake</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You MUST read the sentence(s) before AND after where you''re placing it</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The correct placement should flow smoothly in both directions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Step-by-Step Approach
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 1: Read the entire paragraph first to understand the overall context
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Even if it seems confusing, get a sense of the topic and flow</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Identify what the paragraph is discussing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 2: Identify the sentence you need to place
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">What specific information does it contain?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">What does it refer to or connect to?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 3: Test each answer choice by plugging in the sentence
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read from the sentence before → through the placed sentence → to the sentence after</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Does it create smooth, logical flow?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Do pronouns have clear references?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Does the information follow a logical sequence?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

3. What Makes a Placement Correct
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The correct placement creates <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">logical flow and coherence</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Information should follow a natural, chronological, or logical order</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pronouns should refer to clearly established nouns</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Transition words should make sense in context</li>

</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Not reading the sentence AFTER the placement
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is the #1 mistake students make</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You must check that the sentence flows into what comes next</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A sentence might connect well to what comes before but not to what comes after</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Not reading the entire paragraph first
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You need context to understand where the sentence fits</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Without reading the whole paragraph, you might miss important clues</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Choosing based on topic similarity alone
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Just because two sentences discuss the same topic doesn''t mean they belong together</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Check for logical sequence and smooth transitions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Rushing through the answer choices
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Take time to actually plug in the sentence at each spot</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read the surrounding sentences carefully for each option</li>

</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">You MUST memorize these area formulas—they are NOT provided on the ACT:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Triangle</strong>: A = ½bh (where b = base, h = height)</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Common mistakes to avoid:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For parallelograms, use the HEIGHT (perpendicular distance), not the slanted side length</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For circles, make sure you have the radius, not the diameter (if given diameter, divide by 2)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For triangles, the height must be perpendicular to the base</li>
    </ul>

2. Volume Formulas and Unit Conversions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Essential volume formulas to memorize:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Rectangular Prism (box)</strong>: V = lwh</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Cube</strong>: V = s³</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Right Cylinder</strong>: V = πr²h</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Any 3D shape</strong>: V = Bh (where B = area of base, h = height)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Surface area formulas (less common but important):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Rectangular Prism</strong>: SA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Cube</strong>: SA = 6s²</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>CRITICAL: Unit conversions</strong>—The ACT frequently tests these, and students make costly mistakes:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Always convert units BEFORE calculating area or volume</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">1 yard = 3 feet</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">1 foot = 12 inches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">1 square yard = 9 square feet (not 3!)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">1 square foot = 144 square inches (not 12!)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">1 cubic yard = 27 cubic feet (not 3!)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">1 cubic foot = 1,728 cubic inches (not 12!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Why you must convert FIRST:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: A field is 136 yards × 93 yards. To find area in square feet:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ CORRECT: Convert to feet first: (136 × 3) × (93 × 3) = 408 × 279 = 113,832 ft²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✗ WRONG: Calculate area then convert: 136 × 93 = 12,648, then × 9 = wrong answer!</li>
    </ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Pythagorean theorem</strong> applies ONLY to right triangles:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>a² + b² = c²</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Where a and b are the legs (the two shorter sides)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">c is the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">hypotenuse</strong> (the longest side, opposite the right angle)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Pythagorean triples</strong>—memorize these to save time:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>3-4-5 triangle</strong>: If you see sides of 3 and 4, the hypotenuse is 5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>5-12-13 triangle</strong>: If you see sides of 5 and 12, the hypotenuse is 13</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These can be scaled up: 6-8-10, 9-12-15, 10-24-26, etc.</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you recognize a Pythagorean triple, you can skip the calculation entirely</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When to use Pythagorean theorem:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">

</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>45-45-90 triangle</strong> (also called a right isosceles triangle):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Side ratio: <strong>x : x : x√2</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The two legs are equal (both length x)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The hypotenuse is x√2 (one leg times √2)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the leg is 5, the hypotenuse is 5√2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the hypotenuse is 10, each leg is 10/√2 = 5√2</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>30-60-90 triangle</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Side ratio: <strong>x : x√3 : 2x</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Short leg (opposite 30°): x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Long leg (opposite 60°): x√3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Hypotenuse (opposite 90°): 2x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>KEY RULE:</strong> The short leg is always half the hypotenuse</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the hypotenuse is 10, the short leg is 5, and the long leg is 5√3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">How to recognize special right triangles:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for angle measurements (45°, 30°, 60°)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for the phrase "right isosceles triangle" (45-45-90)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for equilateral triangles split in half (creates 30-60-90)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you see √2 or √3 in the answer choices, it''s likely a special right triangle</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When to use special right triangles instead of Pythagorean theorem:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When you see the special angles (30°, 45°, 60°)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When the answer choices contain √2 or √3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Special triangles are FASTER than using a² + b² = c²</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

5. Test-Taking Tips for Geometry Problems
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Draw and label diagrams</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If no diagram is provided, draw one yourself</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Label all given measurements directly on the diagram</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Mark right angles with a small square</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Write formulas next to the shapes as you work</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Look for Pythagorean triples first</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Before using a² + b² = c², check if the sides are a Pythagorean triple</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Common ones: 3-4-5, 5-12-13, 8-15-17, and their multiples</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This saves time and prevents calculation errors</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Use substitution for complex problems</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If a problem uses variables (like "a field is l feet by w feet"), pick simple numbers</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Let l = 4 and w = 3, then solve with those specific values</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This makes algebraic area/volume problems much easier to visualize</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Convert units before calculating</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">NEVER calculate area in yards and then convert to square feet</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ALWAYS convert the length and width first, then calculate</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Write out the conversion as a separate step to avoid mistakes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Memorize formulas NOW, not the night before</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Make flashcards for all area and volume formulas</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Practice drawing and labeling 45-45-90 and 30-60-90 triangles from memory</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Review Pythagorean triples until you can recognize them instantly</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Alternative method: Plug point into y = mx + b
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A, B, and C are constants (usually integers)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">To find slope from standard form: slope = -A/B</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">To find y-intercept: set x = 0 and solve for y</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">To find x-intercept: set y = 0 and solve for x</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The distance formula IS the Pythagorean theorem</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The two points form a right triangle with legs (x₁ - x₂) and (y₁ - y₂)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The distance is the hypotenuse</li>

</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Always convert to y = mx + b when possible</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Slope-intercept form is the easiest to work with</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If given standard form, solve for y immediately</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If given point-slope form, distribute and solve for y</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>For perpendicular lines, flip and negate the slope</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Perpendicular slope = -1 / (original slope)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If slope is 2, perpendicular is -1/2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If slope is -3/4, perpendicular is 4/3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Use substitution to verify equations</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If given a point and asked which equation represents the line, plug the point into each answer choice</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The correct equation will make the point satisfy the equation</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This can be faster than calculating slope and y-intercept</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Draw quick sketches for visual problems</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">

</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. Understanding Arcs
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">An <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">arc</strong> is a portion of a circle''s circumference
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Think of it as a "slice" of the circle''s edge</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Arcs are measured in two ways: degree measure or arc length</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Degree measure of an arc:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Equal to the measure of the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">central angle</strong> that intercepts it</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: If the central angle is 90°, the arc measures 90°</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Arc length (the actual distance along the curve):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Arc length is a portion of the total circumference</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use the proportion: arc length / circumference = angle / 360°</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Arc length formula (MEMORIZE THIS):</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Arc Length = (θ/360°) × 2πr</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Where θ = central angle in degrees</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">r = radius of the circle</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">2πr = circumference of the whole circle</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Alternative form (same formula):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Arc Length / Circumference = θ / 360°</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This proportion shows: arc is to whole circle as angle is to 360°</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Useful when you need to solve for the angle or radius</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">sector</strong> is a "slice" of a circle (like a pizza slice)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Bounded by two radii and an arc</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sectors have area, just like the whole circle has area</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Sector area formula (MEMORIZE THIS):</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Sector Area = (θ/360°) × πr²</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Where θ = central angle in degrees</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">r = radius of the circle</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">πr² = area of the whole circle</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Alternative form (proportion):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Sector Area / Circle Area = θ / 360°</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This shows: sector is to whole circle as angle is to 360°</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Key pattern to recognize:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Arc length uses circumference (2πr)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sector area uses circle area (πr²)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both use the same proportion: (θ/360°)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The key insight: the arc/sector is a fraction of the whole circle</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">That fraction equals the central angle divided by 360°</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: A 90° angle means 90/360 = 1/4 of the circle</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Don''t confuse arc length with sector area</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Arc length is distance (1-dimensional) - uses circumference</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sector area is space (2-dimensional) - uses circle area</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read the question carefully to determine which one is asked</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Memorize the formulas now</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Arc length = (θ/360°) × 2πr</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sector area = (θ/360°) × πr²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These are NOT provided on the test</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Use the proportion setup for complex problems</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Arc/Circumference = Angle/360° is easier to manipulate algebraically</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Especially useful when solving for the angle or radius</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cross-multiply to solve</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Simplify the fraction θ/360° early</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">90/360 = 1/4, 120/360 = 1/3, 180/360 = 1/2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This makes calculations much simpler</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (90/360) × 2π(12) = (1/4) × 24π = 6π</li>
    </ul>

Logarithms appear 1-2 times per ACT Math test, usually testing your ability to convert between <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">logarithmic form</strong> and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">exponential form</strong>. Understanding this conversion is the key to solving almost all logarithm questions on the ACT.

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. Basics of Logarithms (Converting Between Forms)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The fundamental relationship between logs and exponents:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>log_a(b) = c</strong> is the same as <strong>a^c = b</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Where a is the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">base</strong>, c is the exponent, and b is the result</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both equations describe the exact same relationship—just different notation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Examples of converting from <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">logarithmic form</strong> to <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">exponential form</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">log₃(3) = 1 → 3¹ = 3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">log₃(9) = 2 → 3² = 9</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">log₃(27) = 3 → 3³ = 27</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The pattern: "log base 3 of 27 equals 3" means "3 to the 3rd power equals 27"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">How to solve logarithm equations:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Convert from logarithmic form to exponential form</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Solve the exponential equation using exponent rules</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: When log₄(x) = 3, what is x?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Convert: 4³ = x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solve: x = 64</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">CRITICAL strategy:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Almost ALL ACT logarithm questions are solved by converting to exponential form</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you can convert, you can solve the problem</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Practice this conversion until it''s automatic!</li>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Using Your Calculator (Change of Base Rule)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">change of base rule</strong> lets you use a calculator:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>log_b(a) = log(a) / log(b)</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This converts ANY logarithm to base 10 (which calculators can compute)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: log₃(9) = log(9) / log(3) = 0.954 / 0.477 = 2</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Using the change of base rule on your calculator:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">To find log₃(9): Enter log(9) ÷ log(3) in calculator</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">To find log₂(8): Enter log(8) ÷ log(2) in calculator</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This works for ANY base and ANY value</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Some calculators have a built-in logbase function:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>TI-83/84:</strong> Press MATH, scroll to LOGBASE</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This allows direct entry: logbase(3, 9) = 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Check if your calculator has this feature—it''s faster!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Calculator method vs. algebraic method:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For simple bases (2, 3, 4, 5): Converting to exponential form is often faster</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For complex problems with multiple logs: Use change of base rule</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 5(log₃(9) + log₂(8)) can be solved entirely with calculator</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Logarithm Rules (For Advanced Questions)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Four logarithm rules you should know:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Product Rule:</strong> log_a(xy) = log_a(x) + log_a(y)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Quotient Rule:</strong> log_a(x/y) = log_a(x) - log_a(y)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Power Rule:</strong> log_a(x^n) = n·log_a(x)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Log of 1:</strong> log_a(1) = 0 (because a⁰ = 1)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When to use these rules:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These appear RARELY on the ACT (1-2 times per test, if at all)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Most often on the LAST 10 questions (hardest section)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Students aiming for 30+ should memorize these</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Other students can skip—focus on conversion first!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example using power rule:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If log₉(3^x) = 3/2, what is x?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use power rule: x·log₉(3) = 3/2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Find log₉(3) using change of base: log(3)/log(9) = 1/2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Substitute: x·(1/2) = 3/2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solve: x = 3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Shortcut - backsolving with calculator:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If answer choices are given, plug each one in</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use change of base rule to evaluate both sides</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The correct answer makes both sides equal</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is often faster than using logarithm rules!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Natural Logarithms (ln)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Natural logarithms</strong> use base e (approximately 2.71828):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>ln(b) = c</strong> is the same as <strong>e^c = b</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The base "e" is invisible—it''s always e for natural logs</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ln is just shorthand notation for log_e</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Natural logarithms appear VERY rarely:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Usually only in the last 5-10 questions (hardest section)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Students rushing through can skip this topic entirely</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Students aiming for 30+ should learn the basics</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Solving natural logarithm equations:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: If ln(x-1) = 3, then x = ?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Convert to exponential form: e³ = x-1</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Solve for x: x = e³ + 1</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Same conversion strategy as regular logarithms!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">All logarithm rules work for natural logs too:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ln(xy) = ln(x) + ln(y)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ln(x/y) = ln(x) - ln(y)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ln(x^n) = n·ln(x)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ln(1) = 0</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Use your calculator with the change of base rule</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">log_b(a) = log(a) / log(b) works for ANY logarithm</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This lets you evaluate complex expressions quickly</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Check if your calculator has a built-in logbase function</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Backsolve when answer choices are given</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Plug each answer choice into the original equation</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use change of base rule to evaluate on calculator</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Often faster than using logarithm rules algebraically</li>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Target score below 28: Focus ONLY on conversion and change of base</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Target score 28-32: Memorize the four logarithm rules</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Target score 33+: Learn natural logarithms too</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t waste time on rare topics if you need basics first!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Remember: logarithms are just another form of exponents</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you understand exponents well, logarithms become easier</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The conversion is the bridge between the two</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If (y + 5), the center y-coordinate is -5 (opposite sign!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Finding the radius:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">r² is on the right side of the equation</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (x - 2)² + (y - 1)² = 25 has r² = 25, so r = 5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (x + 1)² + (y - 3)² = 100 has r² = 100, so r = 10</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t forget to take the square root!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Special case - circle centered at origin:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>x² + y² = r²</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Center: (0, 0)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: x² + y² = 49 is centered at origin with radius 7</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Writing the equation when given center and radius:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Center (3, -2) and radius 5: (x - 3)² + (y + 2)² = 25</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Center (-4, 7) and radius 6: (x + 4)² + (y - 7)² = 36</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Remember to square the radius!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

2. Completing the Square for Circles
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Sometimes circle equations are given in <strong>expanded form</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: x² + 4x + y² - 8y + 5 = 0</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This doesn''t look like standard form!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You must <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">complete the square</strong> to find center and radius</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Steps to complete the square:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Group x terms and y terms: (x² + 4x) + (y² - 8y) = -5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: For x terms, take half of coefficient of x, square it: (4/2)² = 4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: For y terms, take half of coefficient of y, square it: (-8/2)² = 16</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: Add these to both sides: (x² + 4x + 4) + (y² - 8y + 16) = -5 + 4 + 16</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 5: Factor: (x + 2)² + (y - 4)² = 15</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Now you can read center (-2, 4) and radius √15</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Quick formula for completing the square:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For x² + bx, add (b/2)²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This creates a perfect square: (x + b/2)²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Same process for y terms</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Ellipses and Hyperbolas (Basic Recognition)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Ellipse</strong> standard form:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>(x - h)²/a² + (y - k)²/b² = 1</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Center: (h, k), just like a circle</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Looks like a stretched or compressed circle</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both terms are added (+), both squared</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (x - 2)²/9 + (y + 1)²/4 = 1 is centered at (2, -1)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Hyperbola</strong> standard form:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>(x - h)²/a² - (y - k)²/b² = 1</strong> or <strong>(y - k)²/b² - (x - h)²/a² = 1</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Center: (h, k)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Has two separate curved branches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Key difference: One term is subtracted (-)</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (x - 3)²/16 - (y + 2)²/9 = 1 is centered at (3, -2)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">How to identify which conic section:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Circle</strong>: x² and y² have same coefficient, added together</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Ellipse</strong>: x² and y² have different coefficients, added together</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Hyperbola</strong>: x² and y² are subtracted</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">On the ACT:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Circles are tested most frequently</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Ellipses and hyperbolas appear 0-2 times per test</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Usually just need to identify center or general shape</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Deep knowledge of ellipse/hyperbola properties rarely needed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Test-Taking Tips for Conic Sections
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Master the circle equation first</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">(x - h)² + (y - k)² = r² is the most tested formula</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Practice reading the center until automatic</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Remember: opposite signs! (x - 3) means center x = 3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Watch for completing the square questions</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the equation isn''t in standard form, you''ll need to complete the square</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Take half the coefficient, square it, add to both sides</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t forget to move the constant to the other side first!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Use the signs to identify the conic</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both terms positive (+)? Circle or ellipse</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">One term negative (-)? Hyperbola</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This quick check eliminates wrong answers fast</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Radius is always positive</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">r² = 25 means r = 5 (not ±5)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Radius cannot be negative in geometry</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Memorize the standard forms</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Circle: (x-h)²+(y-k)²=r²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Ellipse: (x-h)²/a²+(y-k)²/b²=1</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Hyperbola: (x-h)²/a²-(y-k)²/b²=1</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These formulas are NOT provided on the test</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

1. What Is Backsolving?
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Backsolving</strong> means plugging answer choices into the problem to find which one works
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Instead of setting up equations and solving for x, you test each choice</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Transforms complex algebra into simple arithmetic</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Works by substituting values until you find one that satisfies all conditions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Key advantages over traditional algebra:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Often faster than setting up and solving complex equations</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Less likely to make calculation errors with concrete numbers</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Can verify your answer immediately</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Works even if you struggle with algebra</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Answer choices</strong> are concrete numbers, not <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">algebraic expressions</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">

2. The Strategic Backsolving Process
</h3>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 1: Strategic Starting
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Use the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">middle value strategy</strong> to maximize efficiency
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ACT always lists answer choices in ascending or descending order</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Begin with choice B or C (middle values)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If C is too big, eliminate D and E as well</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If C is too small, eliminate A and B as well</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This lets you eliminate 2-3 choices with one test</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 2: Test Your Chosen Answer
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Substitute the value into all problem conditions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Check: Does it make the equation true?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Check: Does it satisfy all constraints?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Check: Does it produce the correct result?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 3: If It Works, You''re Done
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Bubble in your answer and move on
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t waste time double-checking or testing other choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ACT only has one correct answer per question</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 4: Eliminate and Adjust
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">If the answer doesn''t work, cross it off immediately
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Determine if you need a larger or smaller value</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">systematic elimination</strong> to rule out other choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use logic to narrow down remaining options</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 5: Repeat
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Test remaining choices systematically
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Continue until you find the answer that works</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Remember: exactly one of the five choices must work</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Core algebra skills appear on almost every ACT Math question, from simple equation solving to complex multi-step problems. Mastering <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">PEMDAS</strong>, negative numbers, and combining like terms is essential for avoiding careless mistakes and solving problems quickly.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. PEMDAS (Order of Operations)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">PEMDAS</strong> is the order you MUST follow when solving expressions:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>P</strong> - Parentheses: Complete calculations inside parentheses first</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>E</strong> - Exponents: Next, complete any exponents or square roots</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>MD</strong> - Multiplication and Division: Work LEFT TO RIGHT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>AS</strong> - Addition and Subtraction: Work LEFT TO RIGHT</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>CRITICAL: Work left-to-right for MD and AS</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is where the ACT tricks students most often!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 16 ÷ 4 × 2 - 3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: 16 ÷ 4 × 2 - 3 = 4 × 2 - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✗ Wrong: Don''t do 4 × 2 first! That gives 16 ÷ 8 - 3 = -1 (incorrect)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Calculator shortcut:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Your calculator is programmed to follow PEMDAS automatically</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Enter the expression exactly as written and let the calculator solve it</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This prevents order of operations mistakes</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Make sure to use parentheses when needed!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Common PEMDAS mistakes to avoid:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Doing multiplication before division (or vice versa) instead of left-to-right</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Forgetting to complete parentheses first</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Doing exponents after multiplication/division</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Working with Negative Numbers
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The ACT LOVES negative number questions—these are prime mistake opportunities
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Students make more careless errors with negatives than any other topic</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Take extra care and write out every step</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Subtracting negative numbers:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Subtracting a negative = adding a positive</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 2 - (-4) = 2 + 4 = 6</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Think: "minus a minus is a plus"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Distributing negative signs (HUGE mistake area):</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You MUST distribute the negative to ALL terms in parentheses</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 5x - (2x - 5)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: 5x - 2x - (-5) = 5x - 2x + 5 = 3x + 5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✗ Wrong: 5x - 2x - 5 = 3x - 5 (forgot to distribute to the -5!)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The negative sign affects BOTH the 2x AND the -5</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Negative numbers and exponents (another huge trap):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>-x² is NOT the same as (-x)²</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">-x²: Square x first, then make it negative → -x² = -(x²)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">(-x)²: Square the entire negative x → (-x)² = (-x)(-x) = x²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: -2² = -(2²) = -4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (-2)² = (-2)(-2) = 4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Calculator tip: ALWAYS use parentheses around negative numbers!</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Combining Like Terms
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Like terms have the same variable raised to the same power:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">3x and 5x are like terms → can be combined to 8x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">2x² and 4x² are like terms → can be combined to 6x²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">3x and 5x² are NOT like terms → cannot be combined</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Constants (numbers without variables) can always be combined</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Steps for combining like terms:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Distribute any parentheses</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Group like terms together</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Add or subtract the coefficients</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: Simplify the expression</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: 2(3x - 6) + 3y = 6x - y + 8, solve for y:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Distribute: 6x - 12 + 3y = 6x - y + 8</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The 6x terms cancel on both sides</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Simplify: -12 + 3y = -y + 8</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Combine: 4y = 20</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solve: y = 5</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When to combine like terms:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Always simplify equations before solving</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Combining like terms reduces the equation to its simplest form</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This makes it easier to see what to do next</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Cross-Multiplying Fractions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When two fractions are equal, you can <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">cross-multiply</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If x/y = z/w, then xw = yz</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Multiply the numerator of each fraction by the denominator of the other</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This eliminates the fractions and gives you a simpler equation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Visual representation:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">x/y = z/w</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cross-multiply diagonally: x × w and y × z</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Result: xw = yz</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: If x/4 = 6/7, solve for x:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cross-multiply: 7x = 4(6)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Simplify: 7x = 24</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solve: x = 24/7</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When to use cross-multiplication:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When you have one fraction equal to another fraction</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is the fastest way to eliminate fractions</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Much faster than finding common denominators</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
5. Test-Taking Tips for Algebra Skills
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Write out every step—do NOT do mental math</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Careless errors happen when you skip steps</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Writing forces you to be careful with negative signs</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You can check your work if you write it out</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Use your calculator strategically</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For PEMDAS problems: enter the entire expression</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ALWAYS use parentheses around negative numbers</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Double-check your calculator entry matches the problem</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Circle or underline negative signs</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Makes them more visible so you don''t forget them</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Especially important when distributing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Test your answer with substitution</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you solved for x, plug your answer back into the original equation</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Does it make the equation true? Then you''re correct!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This catches algebra mistakes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Master the basics before moving to advanced topics</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These fundamental skills appear in EVERY algebra problem</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You cannot do advanced algebra without mastering these basics</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Practice until negative numbers and PEMDAS are automatic</li>

1. Solving Algebraic Inequalities
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Treat inequality signs (<, >, ≤, ≥) like an equals sign:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use all normal algebra rules: add, subtract, combine like terms</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Isolate the variable just like solving equations</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The inequality sign stays the same for most operations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>CRITICAL RULE: Flip the sign when multiplying or dividing by a negative</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is the #1 mistake students make with inequalities!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: -2x + 5 < 11</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Subtract 5: -2x < 6</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Divide by -2: x > -3 (sign flipped from < to >!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When NOT to flip the sign:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ONLY flip when you multiply or divide BOTH SIDES by a negative</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t flip just because you see a negative number somewhere!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 3x + 6 > x - 4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Combine: 2x > -10</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Divide by 2 (positive): x > -5 (sign stays the same!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step-by-step process:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Move all variable terms to one side</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Move all number terms to the other side</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Combine like terms</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: Divide to isolate variable (flip sign if dividing by negative!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Two types of circles on number lines:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Open circle (○):</strong> Use for > and < (strict inequalities)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The endpoint is NOT included in the solution</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: x > 3 has an open circle at 3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Solid circle (●):</strong> Use for ≥ and ≤ (inclusive inequalities)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The endpoint IS included in the solution</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: x ≥ 3 has a solid circle at 3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Which direction to shade:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Greater than (> or ≥):</strong> Shade to the RIGHT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: x ≥ 10/3 → solid circle at 10/3, shade right</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Less than (< or ≤):</strong> Shade to the LEFT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: x < -5 → open circle at -5, shade left</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Quick memory trick:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The inequality sign "points" to the smaller values</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">So x > 3 means x is to the RIGHT of 3 (bigger values)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">And x < 3 means x is to the LEFT of 3 (smaller values)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

3. Graphing Linear Inequalities in the Coordinate Plane
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Three-step process for graphing linear inequalities:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Rearrange into y = mx + b form (slope-intercept)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Plot the line (dashed or solid based on inequality)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Shade the solution region (above or below the line)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Dashed vs. solid lines:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Dashed line:</strong> Use for > and < (strict inequalities)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Points ON the line are NOT part of the solution</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Solid line:</strong> Use for ≥ and ≤ (inclusive inequalities)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Points ON the line ARE part of the solution</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Where to shade:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Greater than (> or ≥):</strong> Shade ABOVE the line</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: y ≥ 2x + 3 → solid line, shade above</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Less than (< or ≤):</strong> Shade BELOW the line</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: y < -x + 2 → dashed line, shade below</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Graph 2x + 3y ≥ 6
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Solve for y: 3y ≥ -2x + 6 → y ≥ (-2/3)x + 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Draw solid line (because of ≥)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Shade above the line (because of ≥)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

4. Systems of Inequalities and Advanced Graphing
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Systems of inequalities (multiple inequalities on same graph):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Graph each inequality separately on the same coordinate plane</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The solution is where the shaded regions OVERLAP</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: y < 2x - 4 AND y > -(1/3)x - 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Graph both lines, shade both regions, find the overlap</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Parabola inequalities (follow same rules as lines):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Greater than (> or ≥):</strong> Shade ABOVE the parabola</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Less than (< or ≤):</strong> Shade BELOW the parabola</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use dashed curve for > and <, solid curve for ≥ and ≤</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Circle and ellipse inequalities (different shading rules):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Greater than (> or ≥):</strong> Shade OUTSIDE the circle/ellipse</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (x-2)² + (y-1)² > 4 → shade outside the circle</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Less than (< or ≤):</strong> Shade INSIDE the circle/ellipse</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (x-2)²/4 + (y-1)²/9 ≤ 1 → shade inside the ellipse</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When you''ll see advanced inequalities:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Parabola/circle/ellipse inequalities appear in the LAST 10 questions</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These are for students aiming for 30+ scores</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Master linear inequalities first before worrying about these!</li>

5. Test-Taking Tips for Inequalities
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Write "FLIP SIGN" when dividing by negatives</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is the most common mistake on inequality questions</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Circle any negative you''re dividing by to remind yourself</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Double-check the final sign before selecting your answer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Use test points to check your graph shading</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pick a point in the shaded region (like (0,0) if it''s not on the line)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Plug it into the original inequality</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If it makes the inequality true, you shaded correctly!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If false, you shaded the wrong side</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Remember: Open vs solid circles/lines</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">< and > → open circle/dashed line</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">≤ and ≥ → solid circle/solid line</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ACT answer choices often differ only in this detail!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>For systems, look for the overlap</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The solution to a system is where ALL shaded regions overlap</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is usually the darkest shaded area on the graph</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Test a point in the overlap to verify it satisfies all inequalities</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Circle/ellipse shading is opposite of parabola/line shading</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Lines/parabolas: > means shade above</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Circles/ellipses: > means shade outside</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This catches many students—don''t mix them up!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

1. What Is Number Substitution?
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Number substitution</strong> means replacing variables with simple numbers to solve problems using arithmetic instead of complex algebra
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Do you prefer working with numbers or variables? Most students prefer numbers!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Instead of manipulating <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">algebraic expressions</strong>, you work with concrete values</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Transform intimidating variable problems into straightforward arithmetic</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Why this strategy is so powerful:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Questions with many unknown <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">variables</strong> and few numbers often intimidate students</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Working with real numbers is faster and less error-prone than abstract algebra</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You can verify your answer immediately by checking it against the original problem</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Works even if you struggle with complex algebraic manipulation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. The 4-Step Substitution Process
</h3>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 1: Pick Numbers for Variables
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Choose simple, easy-to-work-with numbers
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Avoid 0 and 1</strong> — these can lead to incorrect answers that seem to work</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Use 2, 3, 4, or 5</strong> — small numbers that are easy to calculate with</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Special cases:</strong> Use 10 for percent problems, 10 or 20 for group size problems</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Select different numbers for each variable
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If a question has x and y, pick x = 2 and y = 3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Using different values prevents confusion and ensures accurate results</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Follow any rules stated in the question
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If x must be negative and even, pick x = -2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If y must be greater than x, make sure your chosen values satisfy this</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pay attention to constraints like "positive integers" or "odd numbers"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 2: Write Down Your Numbers
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Record your chosen values clearly
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Write them in your test booklet or scratch paper</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This prevents mistakes when plugging into <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">answer choices</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You''ll need to reference these values multiple times</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 3: Solve Using Your Numbers
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Work through the question using your chosen values
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Replace all variables with the numbers you picked</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Calculate step-by-step using basic arithmetic</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Find your numerical answer to the question</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 4: Test Answer Choices
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Plug your numbers into each answer choice
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The correct answer will match the numerical answer you found in Step 3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Only ONE answer choice will produce your target number</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Once you find the match, you''re done — bubble it in and move on!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

3. When to Use Number Substitution
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Question asks "which of the following" or "in terms of..."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Looking for an expression in terms of variables (m, n, x, y, etc.)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The question describes a situation with variables, not specific numbers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Answer choices</strong> contain variables or expressions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Choices like "0.7nm", "2x + 3", "5(x + 3)"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✗ NOT for choices that are just numbers like 2, 5, 7, 10</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Question has multiple variables with no concrete numbers
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Problems like "n boxes with m items each"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Scenarios involving undefined quantities</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The algebra looks messy or time-consuming
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Setting up equations with variables would take too long</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Substitution often provides a faster path to the answer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

1. Combining Fractions (Adding and Subtracting)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">To add or subtract fractions, you MUST have the same denominator:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You cannot add 1/2 + 2/5 directly—the denominators are different</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">First find the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">least common denominator</strong> (LCD)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Then add or subtract the numerators while keeping the denominator the same</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Quick trick for finding the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">least common denominator</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Multiply the denominators together</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: For 1/2 + 2/5, LCD = 2 × 5 = 10</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This always works, even if it''s not the smallest possible denominator</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">On the ACT, any common denominator is fine—you don''t need the smallest one</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step-by-step process for combining fractions:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 1/2 + 2/5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Find LCD = 2 × 5 = 10</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Convert each fraction: 1/2 = 5/10, and 2/5 = 4/10</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Add numerators: 5/10 + 4/10 = 9/10</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Fractions with variables in denominators (harder but same concept):</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 1/x + 3/(x-4)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">LCD = x(x-4) [multiply the denominators]</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Multiply first fraction by (x-4)/(x-4): (x-4)/[x(x-4)]</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Multiply second fraction by x/x: 3x/[x(x-4)]</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Add: (x-4+3x)/[x(x-4)] = (4x-4)/[x(x-4)]</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Dividing Fractions ("Keep, Flip, Change")
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The <strong>"Keep, Flip, Change"</strong> method for dividing fractions:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Keep</strong> the first fraction exactly as it is</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Flip</strong> the second fraction (take the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">reciprocal</strong>)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Change</strong> the division sign to multiplication</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (2/3) ÷ (4/5) = (2/3) × (5/4) = 10/12 = 5/6</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">This works even when dividing a fraction by a whole number:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (2/3) ÷ 3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Write 3 as 3/1, then flip to get 1/3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Result: (2/3) × (1/3) = 2/9</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">reciprocal</strong> of a fraction:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Flip the numerator and denominator</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Reciprocal of 3/4 is 4/3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Reciprocal of 5 is 1/5 (since 5 = 5/1)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Reciprocal of x/(x-2) is (x-2)/x</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Why "keep, flip, change" works:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Dividing by a number is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 10 ÷ 2 = 10 × (1/2) = 5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Same principle applies to fractions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Simplifying Fractions (Critical Rules!)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Rule: You can ONLY simplify if you can divide ALL terms by the same number</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (2x+10)/4 CAN be simplified (divide all by 2) → (x+5)/2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (8x+3)/4 CANNOT be simplified (can''t divide 3 by 4)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Common mistake: (2x+10)/4 ≠ (x+10)/2 ❌ (You MUST divide ALL terms!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When you CANNOT simplify, split the fraction instead:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (8x+3)/4 = 8x/4 + 3/4 = 2x + 3/4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You CAN split numerators: (a+b)/c = a/c + b/c ✓</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You CANNOT split denominators: a/(b+c) ≠ a/b + a/c ❌</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Simplifying with variables in the denominator:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 3/(6x+30) CAN be simplified → 3/[3(2x+10)] → 1/(2x+10)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 3/(6x+10) CANNOT be simplified (can''t divide 10 by 3)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Same rule: ALL terms must be divisible by the same number</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">CRITICAL: You cannot split denominators!
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">3/(6x+10) ≠ 3/6x + 3/10 ❌ WRONG!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is one of the most common mistakes students make</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When in doubt, leave the denominator together</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Getting Rid of Fractions (Multiply by LCD)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For equations with only numbers in denominators, eliminate fractions:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Find the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">least common multiple</strong> (LCM) of all denominators</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Multiply EVERY term by the LCM</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">All fractions will disappear, leaving only whole numbers</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Then solve the equation normally</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: (1/4)x + (1/2) = (3/8)x
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">LCM of 4, 2, and 8 is 8</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Multiply all terms by 8: (1/4)x×8 + (1/2)×8 = (3/8)x×8</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Simplify: 2x + 4 = 3x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solve: x = 4</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">More complex example with subtraction:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (3x/5) - (2x/6) - (1/2) = (x/10)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">LCM of 5, 6, 2, and 10 is 30</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Multiply all terms by 30: 18x - 10x - 15 = 3x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Simplify: 8x - 15 = 3x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solve: 5x = 15, so x = 3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When to use this method:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you struggle with fractions, ALWAYS use this method!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It turns difficult fraction problems into easy whole number problems</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Works great when ALL denominators are numbers (not variables)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
5. Calculator Strategies for Fractions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Strategy #1: Turn fractions into decimals</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (3/4)x - (2/5) = (1/2)x becomes 0.75x - 0.4 = 0.5x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solve: 0.75x = 0.5x + 0.4 → 0.25x = 0.4 → x = 1.6</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Then convert 1.6 back to a fraction if needed, or check answer choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This avoids dealing with fractions entirely!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Strategy #2: Convert decimals to fractions using your calculator</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>TI-83/84:</strong> Enter decimal → Press MATH → Select "Frac" → Press ENTER</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>TI-30XS:</strong> Enter decimal → Press 2nd → Press PRB → Select F◂▸D → Press ENTER</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you have a different calculator, YouTube has tutorials for your model</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Strategy #3: Use parentheses properly!</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ALWAYS put the entire numerator in parentheses</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ALWAYS put the entire denominator in parentheses</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: To enter (2x+1)/(x-3), type: (2x+1)÷(x-3)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Without parentheses, calculator follows order of operations incorrectly</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Strategy #4: Compare answer choices as decimals</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you solved to get x = 1.6 (decimal)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">And answer choices are fractions like 8/5, 5/3, 13/10, etc.</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Enter each fraction in calculator to see which equals 1.6</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">8/5 = 1.6 ✓ That''s your answer!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Strategy #5: Backsolving</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the question asks "what is the value of x?" with answer choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Plug each answer choice back into the original equation</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use your calculator to check which one makes the equation true</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is often faster than solving algebraically!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
6. Test-Taking Tips for Fractions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Use your calculator strategically</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For numerical fractions: let calculator do the work</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For algebraic fractions: write out steps carefully</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Save mental energy for the hard problems</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Use substitution for "equivalent" questions</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If asked "which expression is equivalent," plug in a test value</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: If the original has x, try x = 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Calculate both expressions—they should give the same answer</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is often faster than algebraic manipulation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Remember the "cannot split denominators" rule</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">a/(b+c) ≠ a/b + a/c ❌ This is ALWAYS wrong!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">But (a+b)/c = a/c + b/c ✓ Splitting numerators is OK</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This mistake appears in wrong answer choices frequently</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>When in doubt, eliminate fractions</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If all denominators are numbers, multiply by LCM</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If dealing with fractions makes you nervous, turn them into decimals</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both methods turn hard problems into easy ones</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Master "Keep, Flip, Change" for division</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This simple rule handles ALL fraction division</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Keep first, flip second, change to multiplication</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Works every time, no exceptions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. What is Absolute Value? (Definition and Basic Operations)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Definition: Absolute value is the distance from zero on a number line</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Distance is always positive, so absolute value is always positive or zero</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">|3| = 3 (3 is three units from zero)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">|-3| = 3 (-3 is also three units from zero)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Order of Operations with Absolute Value:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Complete all math INSIDE the absolute value bars first</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Take the absolute value (make positive)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Complete remaining operations outside the bars</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Example: |3 - 7| + 2</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Work inside bars: |3 - 7| = |-4|</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Take absolute value: |-4| = 4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Complete outside: 4 + 2 = 6</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Calculator Tip:</strong> Most calculators have an "abs(" function for absolute value
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">On TI calculators: MATH → NUM → abs(</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You can use this to check your work quickly</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Solving Absolute Value Equations with Variables
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Key Concept: Absolute value equations with variables have TWO solutions</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Why? Because both a positive and negative number can have the same absolute value</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: |x - 3| = 5 means (x - 3) could equal 5 OR -5</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Four-Step Process to Solve:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Add/subtract any constants OUTSIDE the absolute value bars to move them to the other side</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Multiply/divide any coefficients directly IN FRONT of the absolute value bars</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Set the expression inside equal to BOTH the positive and negative value</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Solve both equations to get both solutions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Example: 3|2x + 1| - 6 = 45</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Add 6 to both sides → 3|2x + 1| = 51</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Divide by 3 → |2x + 1| = 17</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Set up two equations:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• 2x + 1 = 17 → 2x = 16 → x = 8</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• 2x + 1 = -17 → 2x = -18 → x = -9</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solution set: {-9, 8}</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Common Mistake:</strong> Only finding one solution
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ALWAYS check answer choices - if they show two values, you need both solutions!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you only find one solution, you probably forgot the negative case</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Absolute Value Inequalities (The Most Difficult Type)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Key Concept: Absolute value inequalities have INTERVAL solutions (not just two numbers)</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">|x| < 3 means "all numbers less than 3 units from zero"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solution: -3 < x < 3 (between -3 and 3)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Two Main Types:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Type 1: |x| < a or |x| ≤ a</strong> (Less than)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Solution format: -a < x < a (or -a ≤ x ≤ a)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• One compound inequality</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Think: "close to zero" or "between two values"</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>Type 2: |x| > a or |x| ≥ a</strong> (Greater than)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Solution format: x < -a AND x > a (or x ≤ -a AND x ≥ a)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Two separate inequalities with "AND"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Think: "far from zero" or "outside the interval"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Four-Step Process:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Isolate the absolute value bars (move all terms outside to the other side)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Determine the type (< means "between", > means "outside")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Set up the inequality based on type</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Solve for the variable</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Example 1: |x + 3| - 4 < 1</strong> (Less than type)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Add 4 to both sides → |x + 3| < 5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: This is "less than" type, so solution is between -5 and 5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Set up: -5 < x + 3 < 5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: Subtract 3 from all parts: -8 < x < 2</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Example 2: |½x + 2| > 3</strong> (Greater than type)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Already isolated</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: This is "greater than" type, so solution is outside -3 and 3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Set up two inequalities:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• ½x + 2 < -3 → ½x < -5 → x < -10</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• ½x + 2 > 3 → ½x > 1 → x > 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: Solution: x < -10 AND x > 2</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

4. Advanced Absolute Value Concepts
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Absolute Value Properties You Must Know:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>If |a| = -a, then a ≤ 0</strong> (a must be zero or negative)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Why? The only way absolute value equals its negative is if the number is ≤ 0</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>For x > 0 and y < 0: |x| - |y| = x - (-y) = x + y</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Positive number''s absolute value = itself</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Negative number''s absolute value = its opposite</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Comparing Absolute Values:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If a < b < c and c > 0:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• |c| is always the largest (furthest from zero on positive side)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Can''t determine which of |a| or |b| is larger without more info</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: If a = -10, b = -2, c = 5:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• |a| = 10, |b| = 2, |c| = 5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• |a| > |c| even though a < c</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Distance Interpretation:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>|x - a| = d</strong> means "x is d units away from a"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: |x + 2| = 8 means "x is 8 units from -2"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Note: x + 2 = x - (-2), so we''re measuring distance from -2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solutions: x = 6 or x = -10 (both are 8 units from -2)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Equivalent Expressions:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">|x - y - z| = |x - (y + z)|</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This also equals |-x + y + z| (opposite signs for all terms)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Absolute value of opposites are equal: |a| = |-a|</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Special Case: No Solution</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you end up with something like |-3x + 1| + 15 < 12:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Isolate: |-3x + 1| < -3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Absolute value can NEVER be negative, so NO SOLUTION!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
5. Test-Taking Tips for Absolute Value
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Tip #1: Look at answer choices first to determine what type of problem it is</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Two numbers in braces like {-9, 8}? → Absolute value equation (2 solutions)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Compound inequality like -8 < x < 2? → Absolute value inequality (interval)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Two inequalities with AND? → Greater than type inequality</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Tip #2: For equations, backsolve by plugging in answer choices</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the question asks for the solution to |2x - 4| = 10:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Try x = 7: |2(7) - 4| = |14 - 4| = |10| = 10 ✓</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is often faster than algebraic solving</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Tip #3: Remember the critical patterns</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">|x| < a → between two values (one compound inequality)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">|x| > a → outside two values (two separate inequalities with AND)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Memorize these patterns - they appear on EVERY ACT test!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Tip #4: Watch out for the "no solution" trap</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you isolate absolute value bars and get |something| < negative number → NO SOLUTION</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you isolate and get |something| = negative number → NO SOLUTION</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This often appears as answer choice "No solution" or "The empty set"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  <ul style="color: white; margin: 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.9; font-size: 0.98rem;">
    <li style="margin: 0.5rem 0;"><strong>Absolute value equations with variables ALWAYS have two solutions</strong> - set the inside equal to both positive and negative values</li>
    <li style="margin: 0.5rem 0;"><strong>For inequalities: |x| < a means -a < x < a (between), while |x| > a means x < -a AND x > a (outside)</strong></li>
    <li style="margin: 0.5rem 0;"><strong>Always isolate the absolute value bars first</strong> before setting up your equations or inequalities</li>
    <li style="margin: 0.5rem 0;"><strong>Remember: absolute value can never be negative</strong> - if you get |something| < 0, the answer is "no solution"</li>

1. Exponent Rules (Memorize These!)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The seven essential <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">exponent rules</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Product Rule: a^x × a^y = a^(x+y)</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 3³ × 3⁴ = 3⁷</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When multiplying with the same base, add the exponents</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Quotient Rule: a^x ÷ a^y = a^(x-y)</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 5⁷ ÷ 5² = 5⁵</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When dividing with the same base, subtract the exponents</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Power Rule: (a^x)^y = a^(xy)</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (2³)² = 2⁶</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When raising a power to a power, multiply the exponents</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">CRITICAL: Distribute to ALL terms, including coefficients!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (-2xy³)² = 4x²y⁶ (the -2 becomes 4!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Negative Exponent Rule: a^(-x) = 1/a^x</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 2^(-3) = 1/2³ = 1/8</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Negative exponents mean "reciprocal"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Trick: Moving a term from numerator to denominator (or vice versa) flips the sign of the exponent</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: x^(-2)/y^(-3) = y³/x²</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Zero Power Rule: a^0 = 1</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 139⁰ = 1</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ANY number to the zero power equals 1 (except 0⁰ which is undefined)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>One Power Rule: a^1 = a</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (-4)¹ = -4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Any number to the first power is itself</li>

  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Fraction Power Rule</strong>: a^(x/y) = ʸ√(a^x)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 8^(2/3) = ³√(8²) = ³√64 = 4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Or: 8^(2/3) = (³√8)² = 2² = 4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The denominator is the root, the numerator is the power</li>
    </ul>

2. Solving Exponential Equations
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When bases are the same, set exponents equal:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If 4^(3x+1) = 4^(-x+7), then 3x+1 = -x+7</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solve: 4x = 6, so x = 3/2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This works because equal exponential expressions with the same base must have equal exponents</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When bases are different, make them the same:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 9^(2x) = 27^(x+4)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Recognize that 9 = 3² and 27 = 3³</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Rewrite: (3²)^(2x) = (3³)^(x+4)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Simplify: 3^(4x) = 3^(3x+12)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Set exponents equal: 4x = 3x+12, so x = 12</li>

3. Simplifying Radicals
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">To simplify a square root, factor and take out pairs:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: √50 = √(5×5×2) = 5√2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">There''s a pair of 5''s, so take the 5 out front</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The 2 is not part of a pair, so it stays under the radical</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">More complex example:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">√108 = √(2×2×3×3×3) = (2×3)√3 = 6√3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">We have a pair of 2''s and a pair of 3''s, so take both out</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The third 3 is not part of a pair, so it stays under the radical</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Going backwards - putting numbers back under the radical:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Take the number outside and square it under the radical</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 6√3 = √(6×6×3) = √108</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is useful when you need to combine radicals</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Combining radicals (only like radicals can be combined):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: √45 + √20 = 3√5 + 2√5 = 5√5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">First simplify each radical: √45 = √(3×3×5) = 3√5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">And: √20 = √(2×2×5) = 2√5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Then combine like radicals by adding coefficients</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Operations with Radicals
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Multiplying and dividing radicals:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>√x × √y = √(xy)</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: √8 × √2 = √16 = 4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>√x ÷ √y = √(x/y)</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: √50 ÷ √2 = √(50/2) = √25 = 5</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Solving radical equations:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: If √(2x) = 5√6, solve for x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Method #1: Move the 5 under the radical: √(2x) = √(6×5×5) = √150</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Since the radicals are equal, the contents must be equal: 2x = 150, so x = 75</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Alternate method - square both sides:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">(√(2x))² = (5√6)²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">2x = 25 × 6</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">2x = 150, so x = 75</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Cube roots and higher roots follow the same rules:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">³√(xy) = ³√x × ³√y</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: ³√16 = ³√(8×2) = ³√8 × ³√2 = 2³√2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For cube roots, take out groups of three instead of pairs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
5. Test-Taking Tips for Exponents and Roots
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Memorize all seven exponent rules COLD</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You cannot skip any of them—all appear on the ACT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Practice until you can apply them instantly without thinking</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The product, quotient, and power rules are tested most often</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>When distributing powers, distribute to EVERYTHING</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t forget coefficients! (-2x)³ = -8x³, not -2x³</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t forget ALL variables! (3xy²)² = 9x²y⁴, not 9xy⁴</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is the #1 mistake students make with exponents</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Use your calculator to backsolve when possible</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the question gives answer choices, plugging in is often faster</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Calculate both sides of the equation with each answer</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This works great for exponential equations and radical equations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>For radicals, factor methodically</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Break numbers down into prime factors to find all pairs</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 72 = 2×2×2×3×3 → pairs of 2''s and 3''s → 6√2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t rush—missing a pair means getting the wrong answer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Look for common bases in exponential equations</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Recognize that 4 = 2², 8 = 2³, 16 = 2⁴</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Recognize that 9 = 3², 27 = 3³, 81 = 3⁴</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Converting to the same base makes equations much easier to solve</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Only need to check up to √n</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Is 97 prime? Check 2, 3, 5, 7 (√97 ≈ 9.8)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">None divide evenly → 97 is prime</li>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When 17 is divided by 5, the remainder is 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Because 17 = 5(3) + 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">On calculator: 17 ÷ 5 = 3.4 → take 3 → 5(3) = 15 → 17 - 15 = 2</li>

2. Parallel Lines and Angle Relationships
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When two <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">parallel lines</strong> are crossed by another line (called a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">transversal</strong>), special angle relationships are created</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The most important rule to remember:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">There are <strong>two sets of identical angles</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Any angle from the first set is <strong>supplementary</strong> to any angle from the second set</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: If one angle is 60°, four angles will be 60° and four angles will be 120°</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Specific angle relationships you should know:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Vertical angles</strong> are equal</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Alternate interior angles</strong> are equal (angles on opposite sides of the transversal, between the parallel lines)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Corresponding angles</strong> are equal (angles in the same position at each intersection)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Opposite interior angles</strong> are supplementary (they add to 180°)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>TIP:</strong> Extend parallel lines with your pencil
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sometimes parallel lines in diagrams don''t extend all the way across</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Draw them longer yourself to make angle relationships easier to see</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: In a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">parallelogram</strong>, extend the sides to create full parallel lines</li>

3. Interior Angles in Polygons
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Every <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">polygon</strong> has a specific sum of interior angles based on the number of sides
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Triangle</strong> (3 sides): 180°</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Quadrilateral</strong> (4 sides): 360°</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Pentagon</strong> (5 sides): 540°</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Hexagon</strong> (6 sides): 720°</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The formula for any polygon:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Sum of Interior Angles = 180°(n − 2)</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Where <em>n</em> is the number of sides</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This formula works for <strong>any polygon</strong>, regardless of shape</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">How to use this formula on the ACT:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Count the number of sides of the polygon</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Plug n into the formula: 180°(n − 2)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Set the sum equal to the given angles and solve</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The shape doesn''t matter—only the number of sides matters</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Common polygon applications:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">

4. Test-Taking Tips for Angle Questions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Always label angles as you find them</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Write angle measurements directly on the diagram</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The more angles you label, the easier it becomes to find the angle you need</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use vertical angle and supplementary angle relationships to fill in values</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Look for triangles within the figure</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">All angles in a triangle add to 180°</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you know two angles in a triangle, you can find the third</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sometimes you need to find angles in one triangle to solve another triangle</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Watch for <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">angle bisectors</strong></strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">An <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">angle bisector</strong> cuts an angle exactly in half</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If an angle is 72° and it''s bisected, each half is 36°</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use this to find additional angles in the figure</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Use what you know about parallel lines</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you see two parallel lines, look for the transversal</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Identify which angles are equal and which are supplementary</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Remember: there are two groups of identical angles</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

1. Simple Percentages
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Two methods for solving percentage problems:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Method 1: Proportion</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">new/original = %/100</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Original" is the starting value (100%)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"New" is the percentage of the starting value</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Method 2: Decimal shortcut (FASTER)</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Convert percentage to decimal by dividing by 100</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">72% = 0.72, 120% = 1.2, 8.5% = 0.085</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Multiply: new = original × decimal</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is faster and less error-prone!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Isaiah bought a watch for 72% of the original $160 price. How much did he pay?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Method 1 (Proportion): x/160 = 72/100 → x = $115.20</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Method 2 (Decimal): 0.72 × 160 = $115.20</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both give same answer, but decimal method is faster!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Finding the original when given the percentage:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Golf clubs cost $720 at 80% of original price. Find original price.</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Set up: 720 = 0.80 × original</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solve: original = 720 ÷ 0.80 = $900</li>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Percent Increase = (New - Original) ÷ Original × 100</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Find the difference, divide by original, multiply by 100</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">CRITICAL: Always divide by the ORIGINAL (starting) value</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Population increases from 500,000 to 620,000. Find percent increase.
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Find the change</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Change = 620,000 - 500,000 = 120,000</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Divide by original</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">120,000 ÷ 500,000 = 0.24</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Convert to percentage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">0.24 × 100 = 24% increase</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Shortcut for calculating new value after percent increase:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For a 20% increase: multiply by 1.20 (not 0.20!)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For a 35% increase: multiply by 1.35</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For a 150% increase: multiply by 2.50</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Formula: New = Original × (1 + percent/100)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Percent Decrease
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">percent decrease</strong> formula:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Percent Decrease = (Original - New) ÷ Original × 100</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Find the difference, divide by original, multiply by 100</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Same process as percent increase, just subtract in reverse</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Price decreases from $80 to $68. Find percent decrease.
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Find the change</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Change = 80 - 68 = 12</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Divide by original</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">12 ÷ 80 = 0.15</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Convert to percentage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">0.15 × 100 = 15% decrease</li>

4. Multiple Percentage Changes
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">CRITICAL: Percentage changes are multiplicative, NOT additive
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A 20% increase followed by a 20% decrease does NOT return to original!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Each percentage change applies to the NEW value, not the original</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Must calculate step-by-step</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Price starts at $100, increases 20%, then decreases 20%. What''s the final price?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Apply 20% increase</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">$100 × 1.20 = $120</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Apply 20% decrease to NEW value</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">$120 × 0.80 = $96</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Final price is $96, NOT $100!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Shortcut for multiple changes:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Multiply all the multipliers together</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">20% increase then 20% decrease: 1.20 × 0.80 = 0.96</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Final = Original × 0.96 = $100 × 0.96 = $96</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Successive increases:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 10% increase, then another 10% increase</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Total: 1.10 × 1.10 = 1.21 (a 21% increase, not 20%!)</li>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">30% off means pay 70% (multiply by 0.70)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sale price = Original × (1 - discount rate)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">To find original from sale: Original = Sale ÷ (1 - discount rate)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Tips and taxes:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">15% tip on $50 meal: $50 × 0.15 = $7.50 tip</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Total with tip: $50 × 1.15 = $57.50</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sales tax works the same way</li>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">20% of 30% of 500 = 0.20 × 0.30 × 500 = 30</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Multiply all the decimals together</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">What percent is X of Y?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Formula: (X ÷ Y) × 100</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: What percent is 15 of 60?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">(15 ÷ 60) × 100 = 0.25 × 100 = 25%</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Common mistake to avoid:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When finding percent change, ALWAYS divide by the ORIGINAL value</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Wrong: dividing by the new value</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Right: (change) ÷ (original) × 100</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

1. Understanding Ratios
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">What ratios represent:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Ratios compare quantities using division</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Written as a:b or a/b or "a to b"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: If ratio of oranges to apples is 2:3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This means for every 2 oranges, there are 3 apples</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">CRITICAL: The "x trick" for ratios
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If ratio is a:b, think of it as ax:bx</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both parts must be multiplied by the same value</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Ratio 4:6 means 4x red marbles and 6x green marbles</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This trick is essential for solving ratio problems!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Simplifying ratios:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Divide both parts by their GCF</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 12:18 = 2:3 (divide both by 6)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 25:100 = 1:4 (divide both by 25)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Ratio Problems with Totals
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When given a ratio and a total:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use the "x trick" to set up an equation</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Add the ratio parts to equal the total</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solve for x, then find what the question asks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Red to green marbles is 4:6. Total is 80. How many red?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Use x trick</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Red = 4x, Green = 6x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Set up equation with total</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">4x + 6x = 80</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Solve for x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">10x = 80 → x = 8</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: Find red marbles</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Red = 4x = 4(8) = 32 marbles</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Alternative method: Use fractions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Red marbles = (4/(4+6)) × 80 = (4/10) × 80 = 32</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Denominator = sum of ratio parts</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">a/b = c/d</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">To solve, cross multiply: a × d = b × c</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Then solve for the unknown variable</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: If 3/5 = x/20, find x
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Cross multiply</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">3 × 20 = 5 × x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Simplify</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">60 = 5x</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">x = 12</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Direct proportion word problems:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If 5 apples cost $3, how much do 8 apples cost?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Set up proportion: 5/3 = 8/x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cross multiply: 5x = 24</li>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Unit rate = quantity ÷ units</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 120 miles in 2 hours</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Rate = 120 ÷ 2 = 60 miles per hour</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use rate to find distance: distance = rate × time</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Scale problems:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Map scale: 1 inch = 50 miles</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If distance on map is 3.5 inches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Actual distance = 3.5 × 50 = 175 miles</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Set up as proportion: 1/50 = 3.5/x</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Similar figures and scale factors:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If two triangles are similar with scale factor 1:3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">All corresponding sides are in ratio 1:3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If small triangle side = 4, large triangle side = 12</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Areas scale by the square: 1²:3² = 1:9</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Part-to-part: red:green = 2:3 (comparing two parts)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Part-to-whole: red:total = 2:5 (one part to everything)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If red:green = 2:3, then red:total = 2:(2+3) = 2:5</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Inverse proportion:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When one quantity increases, the other decreases</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: More workers → less time needed</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If 6 workers take 8 hours, how long for 12 workers?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">6 × 8 = 12 × x → 48 = 12x → x = 4 hours</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">10 feet × (12 inches / 1 foot) = 120 inches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The "feet" units cancel, leaving inches</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Mixed units (feet and inches):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 10 feet 3 inches = ?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Convert feet to inches: 10 × 12 = 120 inches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Add the extra inches: 120 + 3 = 123 inches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: To convert back: 123 ÷ 12 = 10 remainder 3 → 10 feet 3 inches</li>

2. Area and Volume Unit Conversions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">CRITICAL rule for area/volume conversions:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Convert the units BEFORE calculating area or volume</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Never calculate area/volume first and then try to convert</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is a common trap on the ACT!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Tennis court is 78 feet long and 36 feet wide. Find area in square yards.
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">WRONG: Calculate 78 × 36 = 2,808 square feet, then convert</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">RIGHT: Convert dimensions first</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Length: 78 feet × (1 yard / 3 feet) = 26 yards</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Width: 36 feet × (1 yard / 3 feet) = 12 yards</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Area: 26 × 12 = 312 square yards</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Pay attention to bolded units:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When the ACT bolds units in the question, it''s a warning</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Double-check you''re solving for the correct units</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This prevents accidentally giving an answer in wrong units</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Dimensional Analysis (Advanced Conversions)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Dimensional analysis</strong> uses conversion factors to convert between units:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Start with the given value</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Multiply by conversion factors to switch units</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Set up fractions so units cancel correctly</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: Multiply and divide to get final answer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Convert 30 meters per second to kilometers per hour (1 km = 1,000 m)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Set up as fraction: 30 m / 1 s</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Convert meters to kilometers: (30 m / 1 s) × (1 km / 1,000 m) = 30 km / 1,000 s</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Convert seconds to minutes: (30 km / 1,000 s) × (60 s / 1 min) = 1,800 km / 1,000 min</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Convert minutes to hours: (1,800 km / 1,000 min) × (60 min / 1 hr) = 108,000 km / 1,000 hr</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Simplify: 108,000 ÷ 1,000 = 108 km/hr</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">One-step method (all at once):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">(30 m / 1 s) × (1 km / 1,000 m) × (60 s / 1 min) × (60 min / 1 hr)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">= (30 × 1 × 60 × 60) / (1 × 1,000 × 1 × 1) = 108,000 / 1,000 = 108 km/hr</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">All units except km and hr cancel out</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Key principle:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If units cancel correctly, your setup is right!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Unwanted units should appear once in numerator and once in denominator</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Desired units should remain after cancellation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

4. Rate Problems with Unit Conversion
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Distance = Speed × Time (must have matching units):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If speed is in miles per hour, time must be in hours</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If speed is in miles per minute, time must be in minutes</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Convert one or both to make units match</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Erica bikes 24 mph for 40 minutes. How far does she travel?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Problem: Speed is per hour, time is in minutes (units don''t match!)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solution: Convert speed to miles per minute</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">24 miles/hr × (1 hr / 60 min) = 0.4 miles/min</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Distance = 0.4 miles/min × 40 min = 16 miles</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Time = Distance ÷ Speed:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: How long to travel 16 miles at 18 mph?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Convert speed: 18 mph × (1 hr / 60 min) = 0.3 miles/min</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Time = 16 miles ÷ 0.3 miles/min = 53.3 minutes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Volume conversions (gallons to quarts):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Two 50-gallon bags, using 3 quarts per loaf (1 gallon = 4 quarts)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Total flour: 2 × 50 = 100 gallons</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Convert: 100 gallons × (4 quarts / 1 gallon) = 400 quarts</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Loaves: 400 quarts ÷ 3 quarts/loaf = 133.3 loaves</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

5. Algebraic Unit Conversion
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When variables are involved:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Same process as numeric conversions</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use conversion factors with variables</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Simplify algebraically</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: A pipe p feet long is cut into n pieces. Each piece is x inches. Find x.
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Convert feet to inches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">p feet × (12 inches / 1 foot) = 12p inches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Divide by number of pieces</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">x = 12p / n inches per piece</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Alternative: Substitution method
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pick easy numbers: Let p = 2 feet, n = 3 pieces</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Convert: 2 feet × 12 = 24 inches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Divide: 24 ÷ 3 = 8 inches per piece, so x = 8</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Plug p = 2, n = 3, x = 8 into answer choices to find which works</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is faster when algebra seems complicated!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Common algebraic conversions:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">f feet = 12f inches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">y yards = 3y feet = 36y inches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">h hours = 60h minutes = 3,600h seconds</li>
    </ul>

1. Scientific Notation Basics
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Format of <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">scientific notation</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Always written as: (digit term) × 10^(power)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 15,000,000 = 1.5 × 10^7</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Digit term: 1.5 (must be ≥ 1 and < 10)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Exponential term: 10^7 (base is always 10)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">CRITICAL requirement for digit term:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Digit term must be: 1 ≤ digit term < 10</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 2.5 × 10^4 is CORRECT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 25 × 10^3 is WRONG (digit term too large)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 0.25 × 10^5 is WRONG (digit term too small)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Why use scientific notation:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Makes very large numbers easier to read and write</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Makes very small numbers easier to express</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Common in science for astronomical or microscopic values</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

2. Converting Large Numbers to Scientific Notation
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Process for numbers greater than 10:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Place decimal after the first non-zero digit</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Count how many places the decimal moved LEFT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: That count is the POSITIVE exponent</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Convert 15,000,000 to scientific notation
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Original: 15,000,000. (decimal at end)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Move decimal between 1 and 5: 1.5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Count moves: 7 places to the LEFT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Result: 1.5 × 10^7</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">More examples:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">201,000 → decimal moves 5 left → 2.01 × 10^5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">8,320 → decimal moves 3 left → 8.32 × 10^3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">250,000 → decimal moves 5 left → 2.5 × 10^5</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Rule to remember:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Moving decimal LEFT → POSITIVE exponent</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Large numbers → positive powers of 10</li>
    </ul>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: That count is the NEGATIVE exponent</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Convert 0.000916 to scientific notation
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Original: 0.000916</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Move decimal after the 9: 9.16</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Count moves: 4 places to the RIGHT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Result: 9.16 × 10^(-4)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">More examples:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">0.0000005 → decimal moves 7 right → 5 × 10^(-7)</li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Rule to remember:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Moving decimal RIGHT → NEGATIVE exponent</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Small numbers (< 1) → negative powers of 10</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Digit term still must be between 1 and 10</li>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Only possible when exponents are the SAME</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Add or subtract digit terms, keep exponent</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (3.5 × 10^6) + (2.1 × 10^6) = 5.6 × 10^6</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use the pattern to determine the value</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pick a specific value that matches the condition</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Count forward or backward in the pattern</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: 3^x has a 9 in the ones place. What digit does 3^(x+3) have?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pattern for powers of 3: 3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, 7, 1...</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If 3^x ends in 9, then x could be 2, 6, 10, 14, etc.</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pick x = 2 (since 3^2 = 9)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Then 3^(x+3) = 3^5 = 243</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Units digit is 3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">OR: Starting from 9, count 3 forward: 9 → 7 → 1 → 3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Key insight:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Any value of x that gives the same units digit works</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Counting forward/backward in pattern gives consistent result</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pick the simplest value to make calculations easier</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pattern repeats every 4 terms</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Every 4th power equals 1 (i^4, i^8, i^12, ...)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Find multiple of 4 near 47: closest is 44 or 48</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Using 48: i^48 = 1</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Count backward: i^47 = -i</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Substitute: 10(-i) - 7 = -10i - 7</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: If k is a multiple of 4, find i^(4k+1)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pick k = 4 (any multiple of 4 works)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">i^(4k+1) = i^(4·4+1) = i^17</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Find multiple of 4 near 17: i^16 = 1</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Count forward: i^17 = i</li>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step-by-step process:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Identify the repeating unit and its length</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Go to the END of the repeating unit</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Find the nearest multiple of the pattern length</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: Count forward or backward to find the target term</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example workflow for 0.235638̄, finding 103rd digit:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Repeating unit is 235638 (6 digits)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: End of unit is "8"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Multiple of 6 near 103 is 102</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: 102nd digit = 8, so 103rd digit = 2</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Tips for success:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For repeating decimals: count the digits under the bar</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For powers: most patterns repeat every 4 terms</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For powers of i: pattern is always every 4 terms</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If pattern isn''t memorized, write out first several terms</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use division to find nearest multiple quickly</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Other applications:

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. Basic Definitions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Four statistical measures you must know:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Mean (average):</strong> The sum divided by the number of items</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Median:</strong> The middle number when ordered from smallest to largest</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Mode:</strong> The number that appears most often</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Range:</strong> The difference between the largest and smallest numbers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The fundamental average formula:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Average = Sum ÷ Number of Items</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Rearrange to: <strong>Sum = Average × Number of Items</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This rearranged form is crucial for many ACT questions!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Memorize both forms</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Find the mean of {2, 5, 8, 9}
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sum = 2 + 5 + 8 + 9 = 24</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Number of items = 4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Mean = 24 ÷ 4 = 6</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Finding Missing Values Using Mean
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The most common ACT question type:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You''re given the average and most values</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Asked to find a missing value</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use algebra to solve</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Five students averaged 24 points. Four scored 22, 28, 17, and 25. Find the fifth score.
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Set up the equation</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Let x = fifth student''s score</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">24 = (22 + 28 + 17 + 25 + x) ÷ 5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Simplify</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">24 = (92 + x) ÷ 5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Multiply both sides by 5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">120 = 92 + x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: Solve for x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">x = 28</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">CRITICAL shortcut:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Always multiply average by number of items first</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This gives you the total sum immediately</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Makes solving much easier!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">In example above: 24 × 5 = 120 (total sum)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Combining Averages
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">CRITICAL: You CANNOT just average the averages!
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When combining groups with different sizes</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Must find total sum for ALL items</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Then divide by total number of items</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Period 1 has 6 students averaging 85. Period 2 has 9 students averaging 90. Find combined average.
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Find total points for Period 1</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sum = Average × Number</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sum₁ = 85 × 6 = 510 points</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Find total points for Period 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sum₂ = 90 × 9 = 810 points</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Calculate combined average</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Combined Average = (510 + 810) ÷ (6 + 9)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Combined Average = 1320 ÷ 15 = 88</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Common mistake to avoid:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">WRONG: (85 + 90) ÷ 2 = 87.5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This ignores that groups have different sizes</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Period 2 has MORE students, so its average should count more</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Always convert to total sums first!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Working with Median
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">median</strong> is positional:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Depends on WHERE values fall in ordered list</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">NOT the numerical values themselves</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ALWAYS order the data first!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Finding median with odd number of values:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: {4, 1, 9, 3, 7}</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Order: {1, 3, 4, 7, 9}</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Pick middle value: 4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Median = 4</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Finding median with even number of values:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: {2, 8, 5, 9, 3, 6}</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Order: {2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9}</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Find two middle values: 5 and 6</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Average them: (5 + 6) ÷ 2 = 5.5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Median = 5.5</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Finding missing value when median is given:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Median of {3, 7, x, 12} is 8. Find x.</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: With 4 values, median = average of 2nd and 3rd</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Order known values: {3, ?, ?, 12}</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Test where x fits</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If x ≥ 7, order is {3, 7, x, 12}</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Median = (7 + x) ÷ 2 = 8</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">7 + x = 16 → x = 9 ✓</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

5. Mode and Range
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Finding the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">mode</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Count how many times each value appears</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Mode = value(s) with highest frequency</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: {3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 9} → Mode = 7 (appears 3 times)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Can have multiple modes if values tie for most frequent</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">No mode if all values appear equally</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Finding the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">range</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Range = Maximum - Minimum</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: {12, 4, 18, 7, 9}</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Max = 18, Min = 4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Range = 18 - 4 = 14</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">How adding values affects statistics:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Adding value equal to current mean → mean stays same</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Adding value larger than max → range increases</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Adding value smaller than min → range increases</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Adding value between min and max → range stays same</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Probability measures the likelihood of an event occurring. The ACT tests basic probability calculations, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">independent events</strong>, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">dependent events</strong> (with and without replacement).
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. Basic Probability Formula
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The fundamental probability formula:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Probability = Desired Outcomes ÷ Total Possible Outcomes</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Always expressed as a fraction, decimal, or percentage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Probability values range from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: A bag contains 38 candies: 18 blue, 10 red, 5 yellow, 3 green, 2 pink
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">What is the probability of selecting a yellow candy?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Desired outcomes = 5 (yellow candies)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Total outcomes = 38 (total candies)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Probability = 5/38</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Finding probability of NOT selecting something:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Count everything that ISN''T the unwanted outcome</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Probability of NOT selecting blue candy</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Blue candies = 18, so NOT blue = 38 - 18 = 20</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Probability = 20/38 = 10/19</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Multiple Events (AND Rule)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">CRITICAL: When events happen in sequence, MULTIPLY their probabilities
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The word "and" means multiply</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Common mistake:</strong> Adding probabilities instead of multiplying</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Select a red candy AND THEN a green candy
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">First selection: P(red) = 10/38</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Second selection: P(green) = 3/37 (only 37 left after first pick)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">P(red AND green) = (10/38) × (3/37) = 30/1406 = 15/703</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Without replacement vs. with replacement:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Without replacement:</strong> Total decreases after each selection</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">After picking first candy, only 37 remain (as shown above)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">With replacement:</strong> Total stays the same (item returned)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If candy is replaced: P(red AND green) = (10/38) × (3/38)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Multiple Possibilities (OR Rule)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When you want probability of one event OR another event:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The word "or" means add</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This applies when events are mutually exclusive (can''t both happen)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Probability of selecting red OR yellow candy
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">P(red) = 10/38</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">P(yellow) = 5/38</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">P(red OR yellow) = 10/38 + 5/38 = 15/38</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Quick method when events don''t overlap:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Count total desired outcomes directly</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Red or yellow = 10 + 5 = 15 candies total</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Probability = 15/38 (same result, faster!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Probability with Geometric Scenarios
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Some ACT probability questions use area or length:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Probability = Desired Area ÷ Total Area</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Or: Probability = Desired Length ÷ Total Length</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Same concept as basic probability, just with geometric measurements</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Dartboard with target circle inside square board
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Square board: 10 inches × 10 inches = 100 square inches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Target circle: radius 3 inches, area = π(3)² = 9π square inches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Probability of hitting target = 9π/100</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Random point on a line segment
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Line segment from 0 to 20</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">What''s probability the point is between 5 and 12?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Desired length = 12 - 5 = 7</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Total length = 20</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Probability = 7/20</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
5. Common Probability Scenarios on the ACT

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">At least one success:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Often easier to find probability of NO successes first</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Then: P(at least one) = 1 - P(none)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: P(at least one red) = 1 - P(no reds selected)</li>

Counting problems ask "how many" ways something can occur. The ACT tests <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">factorials</strong>, the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">fundamental counting principle</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">permutations</strong>, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">combinations</strong>.

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. Factorials
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">factorial</strong> function, symbolized by "!", multiplies an integer by every integer below it:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 2 × 1</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Special case: 0! = 1 (by definition)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Most ACT factorial questions are simple calculations:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 2! + 4! = ?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">2! = 2 × 1 = 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">2! + 4! = 2 + 24 = 26</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Calculator tip:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Most calculators have a "!" button</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Check your calculator manual if unsure</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Saves time on larger factorials like 7! or 10!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Simplifying factorial fractions (advanced):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (3! × n!)/(n+1)!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Expand: (6 × n × (n-1) × ... × 1)/((n+1) × n × (n-1) × ... × 1)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cancel common terms: n! cancels out</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Result: 6/(n+1)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

2. Fundamental Counting Principle
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">fundamental counting principle</strong>: If one event can occur in m ways and another can occur in n ways, then both can occur in m × n ways
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Multiply the number of choices for each decision</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is the MOST common counting method on the ACT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Works when order matters AND when order doesn''t matter (for independent choices)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Creating outfits
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You have 3 shirts, 4 pairs of shoes, and 5 pairs of pants</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">How many different outfits can you create?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Total outfits = 3 × 4 × 5 = 60</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Lock codes
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A lock code has 3 numbers (0-9) and 2 letters (A-Z)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">How many different codes are possible?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Numbers: 10 choices for each digit = 10 × 10 × 10 = 1,000</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Letters: 26 choices for each letter = 26 × 26 = 676</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Total codes = 1,000 × 676 = 676,000</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When choices decrease (without replacement):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Selecting 3 people from a group of 10 for 1st, 2nd, 3rd place</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">1st place: 10 choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">2nd place: 9 choices (one person already selected)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">3rd place: 8 choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Total arrangements = 10 × 9 × 8 = 720</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Permutations (Order Matters)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Permutations</strong> count arrangements where ORDER MATTERS:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Different orderings count as different outcomes</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: ABC is different from BAC</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Used for rankings, positions, seating arrangements</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The permutation formula:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>nPr = n!/(n-r)!</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">n = total number of items</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">r = number of items being selected</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">nPr = number of ways to arrange r items from n items</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: How many ways can you arrange 3 books from a shelf of 5 books?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">n = 5 books total, r = 3 books selected</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">5P3 = 5!/(5-3)! = 5!/2!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">5P3 = (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)/(2 × 1)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">5P3 = 120/2 = 60 arrangements</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Shortcut using fundamental counting principle:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Same problem: 5 books, select 3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">1st position: 5 choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">2nd position: 4 choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">3rd position: 3 choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Total = 5 × 4 × 3 = 60 (same answer, faster!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Combinations (Order Doesn''t Matter)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Combinations</strong> count selections where ORDER DOESN''T MATTER:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Different orderings count as the SAME outcome</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: ABC is the same as BAC is the same as CAB</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Used for groups, committees, selections</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The combination formula:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>nCr = n!/(r!(n-r)!)</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">n = total number of items</li>
