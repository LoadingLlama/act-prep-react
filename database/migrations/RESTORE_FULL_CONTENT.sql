The ACT consists of four required sections—English, Math, Reading, and Science—plus an optional Writing section. This lesson will give you a complete overview of the test format, teach you how scores work, and provide strategic insights to help you maximize your performance on test day. </p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 1. Test Structure and Format </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The ACT is a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">standardized test</strong> used by colleges for admissions decisions. Unlike the SAT, the ACT tests more straightforward knowledge and has a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Science section</strong>. The test is divided into four required sections and one optional section, with a total testing time of about 3 hours (or 3.5 hours with Writing). </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> English Section: 45 Minutes, 75 Questions </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">English section</strong> tests grammar, punctuation, sentence structure, and rhetorical skills across five passages. You''ll have approximately 45 seconds per question. Questions test conventions of standard English (grammar and usage), production of writing (strategy and organization), and knowledge of language (style and tone). This section appears first on the test, so starting strong is crucial for building confidence. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Math Section: 60 Minutes, 60 Questions </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Math section</strong> covers pre-algebra, elementary algebra, intermediate algebra, coordinate geometry, plane geometry, and trigonometry. You have one minute per question on average. A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">reference sheet</strong> with basic formulas is provided, but memorizing key formulas will save time. Calculators are permitted (and highly recommended) for this entire section. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Reading Section: 35 Minutes, 40 Questions </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Reading section</strong> includes four passages: Prose Fiction/Literary Narrative, Social Science, Humanities, and Natural Science. Each passage has 10 questions. You''ll have about 8 minutes and 45 seconds per passage, so time management is critical. Questions test your ability to determine main ideas, locate details, understand sequences, make comparisons, comprehend cause-effect relationships, determine word meaning, and analyze author''s voice and method. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Science Section: 35 Minutes, 40 Questions </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Science section</strong> tests interpretation, analysis, evaluation, reasoning, and problem-solving skills through data representation, research summaries, and conflicting viewpoints passages. Don''t worry—you don''t need advanced science knowledge! The section primarily tests your ability to read graphs, charts, and tables, and apply scientific reasoning. Most students find this section challenging due to the pace (about 53 seconds per question). </p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 2. Scoring System and What Scores Mean </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Understanding how the ACT is scored helps you set realistic goals and track your progress. The ACT uses a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">scaled scoring system</strong> from 1-36, and there''s <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">no penalty for wrong answers</strong>, so you should always guess if you''re running out of time. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> How Scores Are Calculated </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Each section (English, Math, Reading, Science) receives a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">scaled score</strong> from 1-36 based on the number of questions you answer correctly (your <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">raw score</strong>). These four section scores are then averaged to create your <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Composite Score</strong>, which is the most important number for college admissions. The composite is rounded to the nearest whole number—for example, if your four section scores are 28, 30, 26, and 32, your composite is (28+30+26+32)/4 = 29. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> What''s a Good Score? </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The national average composite score is around <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">20-21</strong>. A score of 24 puts you in approximately the 75th percentile, meaning you scored higher than 75% of test-takers. Competitive colleges typically want scores above 27, while highly selective schools (Ivy League, top liberal arts colleges) generally expect 32-36. However, "good" depends on your target schools—research the average ACT scores for admitted students at colleges you''re interested in. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Subscores and STEM Score </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> In addition to section scores, you''ll receive <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">subscores</strong> (1-18 scale) for specific skill areas like "Production of Writing" in English or "Integrating Essential Skills" in Math. You''ll also see a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">STEM score</strong>, which averages your Math and Science scores. While colleges primarily focus on your composite and individual section scores, subscores can help identify specific areas for improvement. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Superscoring </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Many colleges practice <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">superscoring</strong>, which means they take your highest section scores across multiple test dates and recalculate a new composite. For example, if you score English 28, Math 30, Reading 25, Science 27 on Test 1, then English 26, Math 32, Reading 28, Science 26 on Test 2, your superscore would combine the best from each: 28, 32, 28, 27 = composite 28.75, rounded to 29. Check whether your target colleges superscore—this policy encourages retaking the ACT to improve individual sections. </p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 3. General Test-Taking Strategies </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Success on the ACT requires more than content knowledge—you need effective <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">time management</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">strategic guessing</strong>, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">stress management</strong> skills. These universal strategies apply across all four sections. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Always Answer Every Question </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The ACT has <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">no guessing penalty</strong>—wrong answers don''t count against you. This means you should NEVER leave a question blank. If you''re running out of time, quickly bubble in an answer for every remaining question. Statistically, random guessing gives you about a 20-25% chance of being correct, which is better than 0%! </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Pace Yourself and Use a Watch </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Time pressure is one of the ACT''s biggest challenges. Wear a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">watch</strong> (analog watches are best since digital devices aren''t allowed) and set checkpoints. For example, in Reading, you should finish passage 1 by minute 8, passage 2 by minute 17, passage 3 by minute 26, and passage 4 by minute 35. Don''t spend too long on any single question—if you''re stuck after 30-45 seconds, make your best guess, circle it in the test booklet, and move on. You can return if time permits. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Answer Easy Questions First </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Not all questions are created equal. Some are straightforward, while others require complex reasoning. Within each section, scan for <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"quick points"</strong>—questions you can answer confidently in 20-30 seconds. Rack up these easy points first, then tackle harder questions with your remaining time. This strategy maximizes your score even if time runs out. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Process of Elimination </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> When you''re unsure of the correct answer, use <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">process of elimination</strong>. Cross out answers you know are wrong in your test booklet, then guess among remaining choices. Eliminating even one wrong answer improves your odds from 20% to 25% (for 4-choice questions) or 25% to 33% (for 3-choice questions). Often you can <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Cross out wrong answer choices">eliminate</span> 2-3 choices, giving you a strong chance of guessing correctly. </p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 4. Test Day Preparation and Logistics </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Your performance on test day depends not only on preparation but also on practical considerations like what to bring, how to manage stress, and what to expect at the testing center. Being well-prepared logistically helps you focus entirely on the test itself. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> What to Bring </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Mandatory items: your <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">admission ticket</strong> (printed from your ACT account) and an acceptable <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">photo ID</strong> (school ID, driver''s license, or passport). Recommended items: several sharpened No. 2 pencils with erasers, an approved <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">calculator</strong> with fresh batteries, a watch (not a smartwatch), snacks and water for breaks, and layered clothing in case the room is too hot or cold. Do NOT bring: cell phones, smartwatches, prohibited calculators, reference materials, or scratch paper (you can use the test booklet). </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Night Before and Morning Of </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The night before: review a few key formulas or grammar rules, but don''t cram—it''s more important to get <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">8 hours of sleep</strong>. Pack your backpack with everything you''ll need. Set multiple alarms. The morning of: eat a substantial, protein-rich breakfast (avoid sugary foods that cause energy crashes). Arrive at the test center by 7:45 AM for an 8:00 AM start—latecomers aren''t admitted. Use the bathroom before testing begins, as breaks are limited. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Managing Test Anxiety </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Feeling nervous is normal, but excessive <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">test anxiety</strong> can hurt your performance. Practice <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">deep breathing</strong> techniques: inhale slowly for 4 counts, hold for 4 counts, exhale for 4 counts. During the test, if you feel overwhelmed, close your eyes for 10 seconds, take a deep breath, and refocus. Remember: you can retake the ACT—this one test doesn''t define you. Confidence comes from preparation, so thorough practice with realistic timed tests is your best defense against anxiety. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> After the Test </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Scores are typically released 2-8 weeks after your test date (check your ACT account for the exact release date). You can send your scores to colleges for free on test day (list up to 4 schools), or pay later to send additional score reports. Many students take the ACT 2-3 times to improve their composite score—each attempt gives you new experience and insights. Review your score report carefully to identify weak areas, then create a targeted study plan for your next attempt. </p> <p style="height: 1px; margin: 0; padding: 0;"></p><h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700; visibility: hidden; height: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0; overflow: hidden;">.</h3><h3 style="color: #2e7d32; font-size: 1.4rem; font-weight: 700; margin: 3rem 0 1.5rem 0;"> Key Takeaways </h3> <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>The ACT has four sections: English (45 min, 75 Q), Math (60 min, 60 Q), Reading (35 min, 40 Q), Science (35 min, 40 Q)</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Scores range from 1-36 per section; your Composite is the average of all four sections</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>There''s no guessing penalty—ALWAYS answer every question, even if you have to guess</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Time management is crucial: use a watch, set checkpoints, and don''t spend too long on any question</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Many colleges superscore—taking the ACT multiple times can improve your composite</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Test day essentials: admission ticket, photo ID, No. 2 pencils, approved calculator, watch</li> </ul></body></html>')

1. Clauses, Phrases, and Fragments
</h3>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Independent Clauses
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">An <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">independent clause</strong> can stand as a sentence by itself
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Always has a subject and a verb</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read the sentence out loud—if you can stop talking at the end, it''s an independent clause</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Examples: "The dog chased its tail" / "He picked it up"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Dependent Clauses
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">dependent clause</strong> cannot stand alone as a complete sentence
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Most often created by adding a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">subordinating conjunction</strong> to the front</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Common subordinating conjunctions: after, although, as, because, before, even though, if, in order to, once, since, that, though, unless, until, when, whenever, where, whether, while, whatever</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Examples: "While the dog chased its tail..." / "Because he picked it up..."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">How to identify: If you feel like you need to keep talking after reading it, it''s dependent
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cover the first word and read the rest—if it becomes a complete sentence, the original was a dependent clause</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If it''s still incomplete after covering the first word, it''s a phrase</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Phrases
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Does not express a complete thought and can never stand alone</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Provides additional descriptive information in a sentence</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Examples: "Chasing its tail..." / "Excited to open up his present..."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">All missing the subject—we don''t know who is doing the action</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Sentence Fragments
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">sentence fragment</strong> is missing a subject or verb or both
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cannot stand by itself as a complete sentence</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Usually sounds plain wrong when you read it aloud</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Incorrect: "The student running to get to class on time" (missing verb)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Correct: "The student running to get to class on time dropped her water bottle"</li>
    </ul>

2. Five Types of Compound Sentences
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">On the ACT, multiple clauses must always appear as one of these 5 types
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The ACT tests these rules constantly—memorize all 5!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Answer choices that "sound good" but break these rules are wrong</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Type 1: Two Separate Independent Clauses with Periods
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Structure: Independent clause + <strong>period</strong> + Independent clause
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Mary loves dogs. Andrew loves cats."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Type 2: Comma + FANBOYS Joining 2 Independent Clauses
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Structure: Independent clause + <strong>comma + FANBOYS</strong> + Independent clause

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Mary loves dogs, and Andrew loves cats."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">CRITICAL: Must have BOTH the comma AND the FANBOYS word</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Type 3: Semicolon Between 2 Independent Clauses
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Structure: Independent clause + <strong>semicolon</strong> + Independent clause
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Mary loves dogs; Andrew loves cats."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">On the ACT, a semicolon functions the same as a period</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both sides MUST be independent clauses</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Type 4: Dependent Clause Followed by Independent Clause (Comma)
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Structure: Dependent clause + <strong>comma</strong> + Independent clause
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "While Mary loves dogs, Andrew loves cats."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When dependent clause comes BEFORE independent, use a comma</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Type 5: Independent Clause Straight Into Dependent Clause (No Comma)
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Structure: Independent clause + <strong>no comma</strong> + Dependent clause
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Mary loves dogs while Andrew loves cats."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When independent clause comes BEFORE dependent, NO comma</li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">comma splice</strong> joins two independent clauses with only a comma—this is ALWAYS incorrect
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Incorrect: "It is believed that bulls are enraged by the color red, they are actually colorblind"</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Rule #3 (Semicolon):</strong> "...color red; they are actually colorblind."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Rule #4 (Dependent → Independent):</strong> "While it is believed that bulls are enraged by the color red, they are actually colorblind."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Rule #5 (Independent → Dependent):</strong> "It is believed that bulls are enraged by the color red though they are actually colorblind."</li>

How to Identify Sentence Structure Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Punctuation variations in answer choices
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Periods, semicolons, commas, and FANBOYS appear in different positions</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you see these variations, it''s a sentence structure question</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Subject or verb forms vary between choices
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">One choice says "drove" while another says "driving"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Some choices have subjects/verbs, others don''t</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Watch for comma splices in these questions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Three-Step Approach to Sentence Structure Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Find where the sentence is being "split"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for the punctuation point in the underlined portion</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Look left and right of the split point
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Identify whether each side is independent, dependent, or a phrase</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read each side separately to test if it can stand alone</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Apply the sentence structure rules
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use the 5 compound sentence types to determine the correct answer</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Eliminate choices that break the rules</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. The Four Types of Commas
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The ACT tests exactly 4 comma rules—master these and you''ll handle every comma question
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Each type has a specific purpose and can''t be substituted with another</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Understanding when to use each type is critical for avoiding comma errors</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Type 1: Comma + FANBOYS
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Use a comma and a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">FANBOYS</strong> word to join two independent clauses
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">FANBOYS</strong> = For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "My alarm clock did not go off this morning, so I arrived late at school"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both sides must be independent clauses (complete sentences)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Type 2: Dependent Clause Followed by Independent Clause
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When a dependent clause comes before an independent clause, use a comma to separate them
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "While electronic music has become very popular, many people still prefer classic rock"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The dependent clause starts with subordinating conjunctions like while, although, because, if</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is from Chapter 1''s Rule #4 for compound sentences</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Type 3: Unnecessary Information
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Commas separate <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">unnecessary information</strong> from the rest of the sentence
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Information is unnecessary if you can remove it without fundamentally changing the sentence''s meaning</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Unnecessary information can be as short as one word or as long as a lengthy phrase</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Mrs. Ellison, who is known for giving pop quizzes, is my least favorite teacher"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The basketball team, though, did not mount a comeback this week"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Type 4: Listing
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Use commas when listing more than two items or with multiple adjectives modifying the same noun
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example with list: "The group ordered coconut shrimp, hot wings, and onion rings"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example with adjectives: "The old, limping dog still managed to complete the 3-mile hike"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use commas between all items in a series, including before the final "and" or "or"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- Example 1 will be inserted here by ExampleCard component -->
<!-- Database: position=1, lesson_id=[UUID], shown AFTER teaching concept -->

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Unnecessary Information Commas
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The most common comma type on the ACT separates unnecessary information
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Information is unnecessary if removing it doesn''t fundamentally change the sentence''s meaning</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Unnecessary information can appear before a comma, after a comma, or between two commas</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">After removing unnecessary information, what remains must still be a complete sentence</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
The "Crossing-Out" Trick
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">To test if information is unnecessary, cross it out and read what remains
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the sentence is still complete and makes sense, the information is unnecessary</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the sentence becomes incomplete or loses critical meaning, the information is necessary (no commas)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The wooden beam, set at an angle, created an optical illusion"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cross out "set at an angle" → "The wooden beam created an optical illusion" (still complete!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Necessary vs. Unnecessary Information
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Determining if information is truly unnecessary requires careful reading
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Correct (necessary): "The dresses that need to be hemmed are hanging in the closet"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Without "that need to be hemmed," we don''t know which specific dresses</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Correct (unnecessary): "Judith, who went to fashion school, designs dresses for a living"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">We already know who designs dresses (Judith), so the fashion school detail is extra</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
The Names Rule
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The ACT loves testing comma usage with names—you''ll see at least one question on this
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the identifier is NOT specific to one person (friend, teacher, physicist), the name is necessary—no commas</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "My friend Kelly recently moved to London" (I have multiple friends, so Kelly is necessary)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the identifier IS specific to one person (best friend, youngest sister, CEO), the name is unnecessary—use commas</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "My best friend, Andrew, is a certified scuba diver" (I have only one best friend)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
"That" vs. "Which" Phrases
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Phrases starting with <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">that</strong> never get commas—phrases starting with <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">which</strong> always get commas
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"That" phrases are always necessary information</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The dogs that live down the street are always barking"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Which" phrases are always unnecessary information</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "My neighbor''s dogs, which are always barking, love to play fetch"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Exception: Prepositional phrases like "on which," "in which," or "of which" don''t use commas before them</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
"ing" and "ed" Phrases
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Participle phrases</strong> starting with "ing" or "ed" may or may not need commas
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">On the ACT, "ing" and "ed" phrases most commonly appear with commas as unnecessary information</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Excited for the car ride, Jane''s bulldog started to jump up and down"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Marcus applied for the internship, hoping that he would get the position"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the phrase helps specify which noun, it''s necessary (no commas)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The politician waving to the crowd is predicted to win the election"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Prepositional Phrases
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Prepositional phrases</strong> consist of a preposition and its object
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Common prepositions: in, of, to, for, with, on, at, from, by, about, as, into, like, through, after, over, between, during, before, among, around</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Prepositional phrases at the FRONT of a sentence are always followed by a comma</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "On my way to work, I listened to my new favorite podcast"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Prepositional phrases in the MIDDLE or END almost never have commas (99% of the time)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The clothing on the bed is for vacation"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">They contain essential information specifying which noun you''re talking about</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Transitional words</strong> (also called conjunctive adverbs) require specific punctuation
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Common transitional words: however, though, therefore, instead, likewise, nevertheless, regardless, moreover, subsequently, furthermore, in addition, as a result, of course, otherwise, for example</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These are NOT FANBOYS—they require different punctuation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Three Ways to Punctuate Transitional Words
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Position 1:</strong> At the front of the sentence followed by a comma
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "However, the truth would not be revealed until next week"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "As a result, the student was sent to the principal''s office"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This treats the transitional word as unnecessary information you can cross out</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Position 2:</strong> Separated by commas in the middle of a sentence
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The truth, however, would not be revealed until next week"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The student, as a result, was sent to the principal''s office"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Again, treat as unnecessary information between two commas</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Position 3:</strong> Separated by a semicolon and comma when between two independent clauses
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "I expected to pay over $100 for my new hiking boots; however, I found a sale and got them for half price"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Structure: Independent clause + semicolon + transitional word + comma + Independent clause</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">CRITICAL: You need BOTH the semicolon (before) AND the comma (after) the transitional word</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

4. Spotting Unnecessary Information Comma Questions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Unnecessary information comma questions have two defining characteristics
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The words in all 4 answer choices are exactly the same</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The only difference is where commas are located</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When you see this pattern, immediately use the "crossing-out" trick</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
How to Approach These Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Read the entire sentence carefully
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pay attention to any commas NOT in the underlined portion</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These fixed commas are often important clues for finding the correct answer</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look out for sentence structure rules from Chapter 1 that may also apply</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Use the crossing-out trick systematically
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Test each answer choice by crossing out what the comma(s) would separate</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The correct answer leaves a complete, grammatical sentence after crossing out</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
The Pauses and Commas Backup Trick
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Read the sentence out loud (or "out loud" in your head on test day)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you need to take a short pause for a breath, you likely need a comma</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is a backup method—always verify with the crossing-out trick first</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Natural pauses often correspond to where unnecessary information appears</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Use the "crossing-out" trick for unnecessary information commas—if you can remove the information and still have a complete sentence, it''s unnecessary and needs commas to separate it
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>"That" phrases never get commas while "which" phrases always get commas—for names, use commas only when the identifier is specific to one person (best friend, CEO) but not for general identifiers (friend, teacher)

    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Transitional words like "however" require specific punctuation: at the front with a comma after, in the middle between two commas, or between independent clauses with a semicolon before and comma after

1. Semicolons
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The most important rule: A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">semicolon</strong> can replace a period
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both sides of the semicolon must be independent clauses (complete sentences)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you can replace the semicolon with a period and both halves make sense as separate sentences, the semicolon is correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "My boss called me; he asked that I pick up coffee for him."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Common semicolon errors to avoid
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "My boss called me; asking that I pick up coffee for him." (second half is not an independent clause)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "After my boss called me; he asked that I pick up coffee for him." (first half is not an independent clause)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "My boss called me, he asked that I pick up coffee for him." (this is a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">comma splice</strong>—cannot connect two independent clauses with just a comma)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The test: Replace the semicolon with a period
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If both halves stand alone as complete sentences, the semicolon is correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If either half cannot stand alone, the semicolon is wrong</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

2. Colons
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">colon</strong> introduces a list, an example, an explanation, a clarification, or a definition
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">List of multiple items: "I went to the grocery store to pick up some items for dinner: chicken, cheese, and onions."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">List of one item: "I went to the market to get lunch: a turkey sandwich."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example or explanation: "He got what he deserved: a one-week suspension without pay."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Clarification: "Chocolate milk is a great recovery drink after a hard workout: it has the carbohydrates and proteins that muscles need to recover."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Three Critical Colon Rules
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Rule 1: The part before the colon must be an independent clause
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The part before the colon must be a complete sentence by itself</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "The slide showing the most popular car colors in 2018: white, gray, and black."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "The slide shows the most popular car colors in 2018: white, gray, and black."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "The hairstylist excelled in: cuts, coloring, and highlights."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "The hairstylist excelled in cuts, coloring, and highlights." (no colon needed)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Rule 2: Everything after the colon must be only the list, example, explanation, clarification, or definition
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The sentence cannot continue to other topics after the colon</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "Will brought his lunch to the beach: a roast beef sandwich, and he brought his friend Joey a turkey club."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "Will brought his lunch to the beach: a roast beef sandwich. He brought his friend Joey a turkey club."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Rule 3: NEVER use colons with "including," "such as," or "for example"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you see a colon before OR after these phrases, it is always incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "I went to the grocery store to pick up some items for dinner, including: chicken, cheese, and onions."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "I went to the grocery store to pick up some items for dinner: including chicken, cheese, and onions."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "I went to the grocery store to pick up some items for dinner, including chicken, cheese, and onions." (use a comma instead)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "The study relied on techniques such as: direct observation and surveying."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "The study relied on techniques such as direct observation and surveying." (no comma or colon needed)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Advanced: Colons Joining Two Independent Clauses
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">A colon can join two independent clauses if the second clause acts as a definition, example, explanation, or clarification of the first
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Buddy got what he worked for: he really deserved that promotion."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "My father gave me one rule to live by: honesty is always the best policy."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is an advanced grammar rule that rarely appears on the ACT</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Dashes
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Dashes</strong> can function like unnecessary information commas, parentheses, or colons
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Most commonly, a pair of dashes sets apart unnecessary information in the middle of a sentence</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Think of dashes as a stronger, more dramatic version of commas or parentheses</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Pair of Dashes for Unnecessary Information
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Two dashes function exactly like unnecessary information commas
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Residents of Washington D.C. - the capital of the United States - are still trying to get representation in Congress."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Glazed donuts - even if they are unhealthy - are my favorite."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">CRITICAL: You cannot mix punctuation!
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Must be a pair of commas, a pair of dashes, OR a pair of parentheses</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "Deep-dish pizza - a famous meal in Chicago, does not exist in Italy." (mixing dash and comma)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "Deep-dish pizza, a famous meal in Chicago, does not exist in Italy." (pair of commas)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "Deep-dish pizza - a famous meal in Chicago - does not exist in Italy." (pair of dashes)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "Deep-dish pizza (a famous meal in Chicago) does not exist in Italy." (pair of parentheses)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Single Dash Acting Like a Colon
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">A single dash can introduce a list, example, explanation, definition, or clarification
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When acting as a colon, the dash must follow the same 3 colon rules</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "You will need the following ingredients - milk, butter, flour, and eggs."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "In order to establish his dominance, the male lion relied on one thing - his thunderous roar."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The study declared that the results were conclusive - mice will complete the maze faster if they are given soda instead of water."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Advanced: Single Dash Like Parentheses
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">A single dash in the middle of a sentence can separate information at the end just like parentheses
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "After three weeks, the patient was fed up with his doctor''s plan (or lack of a plan)."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "After three weeks, the patient was fed up with his doctor''s plan - or lack of a plan."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This rule has been very rarely tested on the ACT English Test</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

4. Apostrophes
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Apostrophes</strong> on the ACT have two functions: possession and contractions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Most apostrophe questions test whether you can identify the correct possessive form</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Other questions test whether you can distinguish between possessive pronouns and contractions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Possession Rules
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For singular nouns: Add apostrophe + "s"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Terrence''s bike is much faster than my brother''s roller blades."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For singular words ending in "s" (like "bus"): You can add apostrophe + "s" OR just an apostrophe (both are correct)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The bus''s driver" OR "The bus'' driver"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For plural nouns ending in "s": Add apostrophe after the "s"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The boys'' jerseys were all covered in mud after the game."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For plural nouns NOT ending in "s": Add apostrophe + "s"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Our women''s basketball team won the championship last year."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Possessive vs. Plural
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The ACT tests whether you can distinguish between singular possessive, plural possessive, and non-possessive plural
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Singular possessive: "I accidentally stepped on the dog''s bone." (one dog possessing the bone)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Plural possessive: "The dogs'' collars are in the basket by the door." (multiple dogs possessing collars)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Non-possessive plural: "I watched as the dogs played in the yard." (multiple dogs, but no possession)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The trick: Check if the next word is being possessed
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the noun owns or possesses something, use an apostrophe</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If there''s no possession, don''t use an apostrophe</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Possessive Pronouns vs. Contractions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Possessive pronouns</strong> (its, hers, yours, ours, theirs) end in "s" but NEVER use an apostrophe
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: its, hers, yours, ours, theirs</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: it''s (contraction for "it is"), her''s, your''s, our''s, their''s</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Contractions</strong> use an apostrophe to show where letters are removed
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"it''s" = "it is" (contraction)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"you''re" = "you are" (contraction)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"they''re" = "they are" (contraction)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"who''s" = "who is" (contraction)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The plug-in test: Expand the contraction and see if it makes sense
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The cat loves playing with (its/it''s) new toy."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Test: "The cat loves playing with it is new toy." ❌ This doesn''t work!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Answer: "The cat loves playing with its new toy." ✓ Correct (possessive pronoun)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Quotation marks</strong> are most commonly used for direct quotes
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">They can also be used to show a word is being used as a technical term, slang, or in an unusual way</li>

</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Direct Quotes That Are Spoken
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Direct quotes that are spoken are offset by a comma
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Anytime the quote is being spoken (said, yelled, whispered, exclaimed, etc.), use a comma before or after the quotation</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Abigail said, ''I will not pay until the painting is completed.''"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "''The thunderstorm last night woke me up,'' Paul whispered."</li>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the quote is just a phrase or part of the sentence (not being actively spoken), there is no punctuation before the quotation marks</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "My grandfather described the shells as, ''beautiful souvenirs from a past life.''"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "My grandfather described the shells as ''beautiful souvenirs from a past life.''"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The quotation marks show these are the grandfather''s words, but he''s not actively speaking them in the scene</li>

  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Semicolons can replace periods—both sides must be independent clauses (complete sentences). Colons introduce lists, examples, explanations, or definitions, but the part before the colon must always be an independent clause, and you can never use colons with "including," "such as," or "for example."
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Dashes can function like unnecessary information commas or parentheses when used in pairs, and like colons when used as a single dash. Never mix punctuation—use a pair of commas, a pair of dashes, or a pair of parentheses, but never combine them.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Apostrophes show possession (add apostrophe + "s" for singular nouns, apostrophe after "s" for plural nouns ending in "s") or contractions. Possessive pronouns like "its," "yours," and "theirs" never take apostrophes, while contractions like "it''s" (it is), "you''re" (you are), and "they''re" (they are) always do.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Quotation marks are used for direct quotes (with a comma if spoken, no comma if not spoken) and to show technical terms, slang, or unusual usage. When the quote is actively being said, yelled, or whispered, use a comma to offset it from the speaker tag.

1. Subject-Verb Agreement Basics
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong> is the person, place, or thing doing the action
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Usually at the beginning of the sentence</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Cats love to sit in empty boxes." (subject = "Cats")</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The subject must agree with the verb in number
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the subject is singular, the verb must be singular</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the subject is plural, the verb must be plural</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "My dog barks at the mailman every day." (singular subject "dog" → singular verb "barks")</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Three Ways the ACT Tricks You
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Trick #1: Unnecessary information phrases between subject and verb
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Unnecessary information phrases NEVER contain the subject</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cross out unnecessary information to find the subject</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Tortoises, known to live to over 150 years old, are sold at the local pet shop."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cross out "known to live to over 150 years old" → Subject is "Tortoises" (plural) → verb is "are" (plural)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Trick #2: Prepositional phrases between subject and verb (MOST COMMON)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Prepositional phrases</strong> NEVER contain the subject or verb</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cross out prepositional phrases (like "of students," "in the park," "on the table") to find the subject</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The entire group of students is organizing a bake sale to raise money."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cross out "of students" → Subject is "group" (singular) → verb is "is" (singular)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The pod of dolphins hunts as a team."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cross out "of dolphins" → Subject is "pod" (singular) → verb is "hunts" (singular)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Trick #3: Group nouns that sound plural but are singular
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Group nouns</strong> (class, committee, team, herd, jury, etc.) are SINGULAR even though the group consists of more than one person or thing</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The sheep herd waits to be sheared." (herd = singular)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The jury agrees that the defendant deserves to be put in jail." (jury = singular)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Helpful Tricks
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Read the subject and verb side-by-side
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Once you find the subject and verb, read them next to each other and ignore the information in between</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "A large percentage of the voters, many of whom are under the age of 30, prefers the new housing proposal."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cross out unnecessary phrases → "A percentage prefers the new housing proposal."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Now it''s clear: "percentage" (singular) → "prefers" (singular)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Plug in "he/she/it" for singular subjects and "they" for plural subjects
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sometimes it''s difficult to "hear" which verb matches the subject</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For singular words, plug in "he," "she," or "it"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For plural words, plug in "they"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The exact time for the meeting with the softball coach and location for the showcase have not been finalized."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cross out prepositional phrases → Subjects are "time" and "location" (plural)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Replace with "they" → "They (has/have) not been finalized."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Now it''s obvious: "have" is correct</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

2. Verb Tense
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For verb tense questions, trust your ear
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">As a native English speaker, you''ll know what sounds right or wrong</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read for context by looking at the previous sentence(s) and finding other verbs</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Match the tense in the rest of the paragraph</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Do NOT pick a complicated tense when a simple tense works
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Avoid unnecessary complicated forms (has run, had ran, had been running, would have run) when simple tenses work</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Last year, Margot designed a new line of summer dresses." (simple past tense, not "was designing")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Before he votes tomorrow, Dale will research each candidate''s positions on the major issues." (simple future tense)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Perfect Tense (has/have/had + verb)
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Use <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">perfect tense</strong> when there are multiple timelines in a sentence
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Perfect tense = "has," "have," or "had" + verb</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Many surfers enjoy paddling out, but few have ridden waves over ten feet tall."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "While the group of entrepreneurs claimed to all be successful, only a few have started their own businesses."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The bison had been eating when the lions began their attack." (shows the bison were already eating before the attack started)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "By the beginning of next year, the doctors will have finished their preliminary research on lung cancer."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Conditional Tense (would/could)
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Conditional tense</strong> describes what would or could happen
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The verb conjugation depends on how likely the outcome is (probable, improbable, impossible)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Probable: "If I make the free throw, we will win the game."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Improbable: "If I made the free throw, we would win the game."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Impossible (past): "If I had made the free throw, we would have won the game."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Trust your ear and go with what sounds right</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Irregular Verbs
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Irregular verbs</strong> don''t follow normal patterns
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Trust your ear and go with what sounds correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Before the show began, the lights were dimmed." (not "begun")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The deliveryman had rung the doorbell before dropping off the package." (not "rang")</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The "a" vs. "u" rule for irregular verbs
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Many irregular verbs have an "a" version (swam, began, drank) and a "u" version (swum, begun, drunk)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">With "has," "have," or "had" (perfect tense) → Use the "u" version</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Before you arrived, I had swum some laps." (perfect tense → "swum")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">With no "has," "have," or "had" (past tense) → Use the "a" version</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "I swam some laps this morning." (past tense → "swam")</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

3. Common Irregular Verbs
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The most commonly tested irregular verbs on the ACT
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">begin → began (past tense) → has/have/had begun (perfect tense)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">drink → drank (past tense) → has/have/had drunk (perfect tense)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">sink → sank (past tense) → has/have/had sunk (perfect tense)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">swim → swam (past tense) → has/have/had swum (perfect tense)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">run → ran (past tense) → has/have/had run (perfect tense)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">sing → sang (past tense) → has/have/had sung (perfect tense)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Remember the pattern
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Past tense (no helping verb) = "a" version</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Perfect tense (with has/have/had) = "u" version</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This pattern applies to begin, drink, sink, swim, and sing</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Note: "run" is irregular—both versions are "run" (I ran, I have run)</li>
    </ul>

4. How to Spot Subject-Verb Agreement vs. Verb Tense Questions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Both question types show different forms of the same verb in answer choices
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You need to know which type you''re dealing with to answer correctly</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The answer choices tell you what''s being tested</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Subject-Verb Agreement Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Look for singular and plural versions of verbs in the answer choices
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for "is" vs. "are"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for "has" vs. "have"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for "was" vs. "were"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for any verb with singular (like "runs") vs. plural (like "run")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Anytime you see singular and plural versions, the question is testing subject-verb agreement</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"The addition of solar panels to the roof of a house in Nevada makes the house on average 20% more energy efficient."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Answer choices: make (NO CHANGE), makes, have made, were making</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Subject = "addition" (singular) → verb must be "makes" (singular)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Even though there are different tenses, we only need subject-verb agreement to find the answer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Verb Tense Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Look for different tenses in the answer choices
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For example: "requires" (present), "required" (past), "will require" (future)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Check that answer choices do NOT have singular and plural versions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If there are no options for singular vs. plural, subject-verb agreement is not being tested</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The question is testing verb tense only</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"The girl scouts are hosting a bake sale tomorrow to raise money. To get ready, Adya needs to bake two trays of blondies and a box of donut holes."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Answer choices: would need (NO CHANGE), was needing, needed, needs</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Previous sentence uses "are" (present tense), so this sentence should be present tense too</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Answer: "needs" (present tense)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Key Takeaways
</h3>

<ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>For subject-verb agreement, find the subject by crossing out unnecessary information phrases and prepositional phrases (which never contain the subject). The subject must match the verb in number—singular subjects take singular verbs, plural subjects take plural verbs. Watch out for group nouns (team, committee, herd) which are always singular.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Use the "plug-in" trick for subject-verb agreement: replace singular subjects with "he/she/it" and plural subjects with "they" to easily hear which verb sounds correct. Read the subject and verb side-by-side, ignoring everything in between.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>For verb tense questions, trust your ear and read for context by looking at other verbs in the paragraph. Use perfect tense (has/have/had + verb) for multiple timelines, conditional tense (would/could) for hypothetical situations, and remember the "a" vs. "u" rule for irregular verbs: use "a" versions (swam, began, drank) for past tense without helping verbs, and "u" versions (swum, begun, drunk) with has/have/had.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Identify question type by looking at answer choices: if you see singular vs. plural versions ("is" vs. "are," "has" vs. "have," "runs" vs. "run"), it''s testing subject-verb agreement. If you see different tenses without singular/plural options, it''s testing verb tense. This tells you which strategy to use.

1. Pronoun Case: Subject vs. Object
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Pronouns</strong> are words that stand in for a person, place, or thing
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pronouns have two cases: subject and object</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The pronoun''s role in the sentence (subject or object) dictates which type is correct</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Subject Pronouns vs. Object Pronouns
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Subject pronouns</strong> (I, we, you, he, she, it, they, who) are used when the pronoun is doing the action
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "They went to the street festival on Saturday afternoon."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Object pronouns</strong> (me, us, you, him, her, it, them, whom) are used when the pronoun is receiving the action
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The man handed us a stack of flyers."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For simple pronoun case questions, trust your ear</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Pronouns in a List
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Pronouns in lists are tricky because we often say them incorrectly in conversation
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Ignore the other items in the list and just read the pronoun by itself to tell which is correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The policeman asked to speak to my friends and me."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Test: "The policeman asked to speak to me." ✓ (not "speak to I")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "His girlfriend and he went to the hockey game."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Test: "He went to the hockey game." ✓ (not "him went")</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Pronouns in Prepositional Phrases
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Pronouns in prepositional phrases are ALWAYS in the object case
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This rule can be difficult to hear by ear alone, so remember it</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The bet between Joe and me was for just five dollars." (not "between Joe and I")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "To whom was the award given?" (not "to who")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Jerry claims that a great rivalry exists among Tim, Scott, and him." (not "among...and he")</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Who vs. Whom
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The difference between "who" and "whom" is tested on almost every ACT
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Technically, "who" is the subject and "whom" is the object</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">But here''s the trick you need to memorize:</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The he/him replacement trick
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you can replace the word with "he," "she," or "they" → use "who"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you can replace the word with "him," "her," or "them" → use "whom"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You may need to rearrange the sentence, but this trick works for any who vs. whom question</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Examples
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Who stole the apple off the teacher''s desk?" → Test: "He stole the apple" ✓ → Use "who"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"To whom should I address this letter?" → Test: "I should address this letter to him" ✓ → Use "whom"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Who do you want to win the Bachelor?" → Test: "You want him to win" ✓ → Actually "whom" is correct here!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Who vs. Whom in Descriptive Phrases
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">On difficult questions, who/whom can introduce a phrase describing a person
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The normal "he/him" trick doesn''t work if you look at the entire sentence</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Instead, look only at the phrase itself</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: "The child whom I invited to the party was very noisy."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look only at the phrase: "whom I invited to the party"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Test: "I invited him to the party" ✓ → Use "whom"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: "The child who was running down the street was very noisy."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look only at the phrase: "who was running down the street"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Test: "He was running down the street" ✓ → Use "who"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Quick trick: Look at the word right after "who" or "whom"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the word right after is a verb → use "who"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the word right after is a noun → use "whom"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Reflexive Pronouns (myself, yourself, himself...)
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Reflexive pronouns</strong> use the "-self" ending and can only be used when the pronoun refers back to a person or thing elsewhere in the sentence
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "I grabbed three donuts and put them in a box for myself." (refers back to "I")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "I asked my coworker to put three donuts in a box for myself." ("myself" doesn''t work because the subject is "my coworker," not "I")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "I asked my coworker to put three donuts in a box for me."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

2. Possessive Pronouns
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Possessive pronouns</strong> show ownership
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These pronouns must match with the word(s) they''re replacing</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">They come in two forms: possessive nouns and possessive adjectives</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Possessive Nouns vs. Possessive Adjectives
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Possessive nouns stand alone: mine, ours, yours, his, hers, its, theirs
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "That book is mine." (stands alone, not followed by a noun)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Possessive adjectives come before a noun: my, our, your, his, her, its, their
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "That is my book." (comes before the noun "book")</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Matching Possessive Pronouns to the Antecedent
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Possessive pronouns must match the word they''re replacing in number (singular vs. plural)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "The entire team went on stage to pick up their trophy."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The pronoun refers back to "team," which is singular (remember: group nouns are singular!)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "The entire team went on stage to pick up its trophy."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">More examples
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Emmanuel and James came back home after forgetting their phones." (plural subjects → "their")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Thousands of tourists travel to Egypt each year to see its ancient pyramids." (Egypt is singular → "its")</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

3. Pronoun Agreement
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Pronouns must agree with the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">antecedent</strong>, which is the noun the pronoun is replacing
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Whenever you see a pronoun on the ACT, find exactly who or what it''s referring to</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The antecedent can be in the same sentence or in a preceding sentence</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The antecedent can appear anywhere (unnecessary information, prepositional phrases, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Matching in Plurality
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">A singular antecedent must have a singular pronoun; a plural antecedent must have a plural pronoun
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "Each attendee at the party raised their drink for a toast."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Each attendee" is singular → pronoun must be singular</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "Each attendee at the party raised his or her drink for a toast."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Also correct: "The guests at the party raised their drinks for a toast." (plural → plural)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Matching in Gender
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">A male antecedent must have a male pronoun; a female antecedent must have a female pronoun
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Jane and Sarah, after a long conversation with another group of hikers on the trail, said they were too tired to go any farther today."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Jane and Sarah" (female, plural) → "they" (plural, works for any gender)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Common Tricky Cases
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Watch out for singular words that seem plural
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Each member of the women''s track team improved her time." ("each member" is singular → "her")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"A person who is committed to his or her dreams can achieve them." ("a person" is singular → "his or her")</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

4. Ambiguous Pronouns
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For a pronoun to be correct, we must know exactly who or what it''s referring to
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If we don''t know exactly who or what a pronoun is referring to, the pronoun is <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ambiguous</strong> and is always incorrect</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Examples of Ambiguous Pronouns
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Ambiguous "he"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "Stephen smiled at his father as he threw the ball."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">We don''t know if "he" refers to Stephen or his father, so "he" is ambiguous</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "Stephen smiled at his father as his father threw the ball."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Even though it seems redundant, replacing "he" with "his father" fixes the error</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Ambiguous "some"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "Even though the order had not yet shown up, the librarian insisted that she had ordered some."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">We have no idea what "some" refers to</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "Even though the order had not yet shown up, the librarian insisted that she had ordered four copies of the new book."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Spotting Ambiguous Pronouns Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Anytime you see a pronoun in the answer choices, check if it''s ambiguous
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pronouns to watch for: he, him, his, she, her, hers, they, them, their, it, its, this, that, these, those, some, none</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Look for answer choices that replace the pronoun with a specific noun
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The correct answer often specifies exactly what or who is being referred to</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Instead of "he is the most famous," the answer might be "Biggie is the most famous"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Instead of "asked for one," the answer might be "asked for a slider"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Use subject pronouns (I, we, he, she, they, who) when the pronoun does the action, and object pronouns (me, us, him, her, them, whom) when it receives the action. For pronouns in lists, ignore the other items and read the pronoun alone. Pronouns in prepositional phrases are always object case. For "who" vs. "whom," replace with "he/him"—if "he" works, use "who"; if "him" works, use "whom."
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Possessive pronouns must match the word they''re replacing in number. Remember that group nouns (team, committee, class) are singular and take singular possessive pronouns like "its," not "their."
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Pronouns must agree with their antecedent (the noun they''re replacing) in both plurality and gender. A singular antecedent needs a singular pronoun; a plural antecedent needs a plural pronoun. Watch out for singular words like "each," "every," and "a person" that require singular pronouns.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Ambiguous pronouns are always incorrect. If you can''t tell exactly who or what a pronoun refers to, it''s ambiguous. The correct answer will replace the ambiguous pronoun with a specific noun. Watch for pronouns like he, she, they, it, this, that, some, and one in answer choices—they''re often ambiguous and need to be replaced with specific nouns.

1. What is a Misplaced Modifier?
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">misplaced modifier</strong> is a word, phrase, or clause that is improperly separated from the noun it modifies
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This leads to a sentence with an incorrect or unintended meaning</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Misplaced modifiers are hard to spot because we usually know what the sentence is really supposed to be saying</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example of a Misplaced Modifier
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "Consistently erupting, Jack loves taking pictures of the Old Faithful geyser at Yellowstone National Park."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">What''s wrong? The modifier "consistently erupting" is supposed to modify the Old Faithful geyser, but instead it''s modifying Jack!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This sentence suggests Jack is consistently erupting (which doesn''t make sense)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When a sentence begins with a modifying phrase, the phrase must modify the very first noun that follows the comma</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
How to Fix Misplaced Modifiers
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Option 1: Put the modifier right next to what it''s describing
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "Consistently erupting, the Old Faithful geyser at Yellowstone National Park is one of Jack''s favorite things to take pictures of."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Now "consistently erupting" is right next to "the Old Faithful geyser"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Option 2: Change the modifier from a phrase to a dependent clause
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "Since it is consistently erupting, Jack loves taking pictures of the Old Faithful geyser at Yellowstone National Park."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Adding "it is" changes the modifier to a dependent clause, making it clear the geyser is erupting</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
The "Next-Door Neighbor" Rule
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For a modifier to be properly placed, it must be right "next-door" to the noun it''s describing
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Modifiers can be at the beginning, middle, or end of a sentence</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">If the modifier is at the beginning of the sentence, the first noun after it must be the word being modified
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Running from the police, Eric hopped the fence and hid underneath a car."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Running from the police" modifies "Eric" (the first noun after the comma)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">If the modifier is in the middle or end of the sentence, it must be modifying the noun directly before it
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Dr. Anderson, a world-renowned surgeon, fixed my broken leg."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"A world-renowned surgeon" modifies "Dr. Anderson" (the noun directly before it)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

2. Front of the Sentence Modifiers with a Comma
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">On the ACT, most misplaced modifier questions have a modifier at the front of the sentence separated by a comma
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For this type of question, consider who or what the modifier is describing</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Then make sure that person, place, or thing is the first noun in the rest of the sentence</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example: Front Modifier Error
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "Not popular since the early 1980s, the documentary about mullets explored the origins of the wildly popular hairstyle."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The modifier is "not popular since the early 1980s"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">What is "not popular since the early 1980s"? Mullets, not documentaries!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">But the first noun after the comma is "documentary," which is wrong</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">✓ Correct: "Not popular since the early 1980s, mullets were the topic of a recently released documentary."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Now "mullets" (the thing that''s not popular since the 1980s) is the first noun after the comma</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The modifier is right "next-door" to what it describes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Strategy for Front Modifiers
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 1: Identify the modifying phrase at the beginning (before the comma)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for descriptive phrases before the first comma</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 2: Ask yourself: Who or what is being described by this modifier?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Think about what noun makes logical sense with the description</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 3: Find the first noun after the comma
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is what the modifier is currently describing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 4: Make sure the first noun matches who or what should be described
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If it doesn''t match, the modifier is misplaced</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Choose the answer that puts the correct noun first</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- Example 2 will be inserted here by ExampleCard component -->

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Middle or End of the Sentence Modifiers with Commas
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">A modifier in the middle or at the end of the sentence must be directly after whoever or whatever it is modifying
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These modifiers are often set off by commas or use "which" or "that"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example: Middle Modifier Error
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "The research team, which arrived at their nesting grounds early this year, tracked the movements of the blue storks."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The modifier is "which arrived at their nesting grounds early this year"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is placed right after "research team," so it''s describing the research team</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">But the blue storks (not the research team) arrived at their nesting grounds early!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
How to Fix Middle/End Modifiers
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Option 1: Move the modifier to be right after what it describes
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "The research team tracked the movements of the blue storks, which arrived at their nesting grounds early this year."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Now the modifier is right after "blue storks"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Option 2: Change the modifier to describe what''s actually before it
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "The research team, which tracked the movement of the blue storks, noted that the birds arrived at their nesting grounds early."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Now the modifier correctly describes the research team</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Strategy for Middle/End Modifiers
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 1: Identify the modifying phrase (often with "which," "that," or set off by commas)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for descriptive phrases in the middle or end of the sentence</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 2: Ask: What noun is the modifier describing?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Think logically about what makes sense</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 3: Check what noun comes right before the modifier
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is what the modifier is currently describing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 4: Make sure the noun before the modifier is what should be described
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If not, choose the answer that moves the modifier or changes the sentence structure</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

4. Modifiers without Commas
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">In some questions, the modifier will not be separated by any commas
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These are harder to spot, but the "next-door neighbor" rule still applies</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Keep an eye out for phrases starting with "that" or words ending in "-ing" and "-ed"</li>
    </ul>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Words ending in "-ing" (present participles)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The dog chasing the cat ran into the street."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Chasing the cat" modifies "dog" (right before it)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "Chasing the cat, the street was where the dog ran."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This suggests the street is chasing the cat!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>A misplaced modifier is a word, phrase, or clause that is improperly separated from the noun it modifies, leading to a sentence with an incorrect or unintended meaning. Use the "next-door neighbor" rule: modifiers must be right next to the nouns they describe.

These descriptive phrases must be right next to the nouns they modify, whether at the beginning, middle, or end of the sentence.

1. What is Parallel Structure?
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Parallel structure</strong> is the repetition of a chosen grammatical form within a sentence as items are listed or compared
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The items in a list can be words, phrases, or clauses</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Whenever we see items in a list or a comparison between items, we must make sure they have parallel structure</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Items in any list must be written with the same grammatical form
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Items must be all nouns, all verbs, all adjectives, etc.</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When lists are written with proper parallel structure, the sentence flows more smoothly and sounds better</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Many students can "hear" which answer choice is correct without even realizing they''re being tested on parallel structure</li>
    </ul>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "To protect her fragile hands, Julia will not rake the leaves, wash the dishes, and has decided she will not take out the trash."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">List items: "rake the leaves" (verb phrase), "wash the dishes" (verb phrase), "has decided she will not take out the trash" (clause)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Not parallel! The third item is much longer and has a different structure</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">✓ Correct: "To protect her fragile hands, Julia will not rake the leaves, wash the dishes, or take out the trash."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">All three items are now verb phrases: "rake," "wash," "take out"</li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">No matter how simple or complex the items in the list are, they must be parallel
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Lists can contain nouns, verb phrases, adjectives, or entire clauses</li>

</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Lists of 3 or more items are easier to spot
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You will be able to more obviously "hear" which answer choice is correct or incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "She made her bed, cleaned the shelves, and swept the floor" (all past tense verbs)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Lists of 2 are more difficult to spot and can trick you
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">They can often sound good even if they''re not parallel</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Be extra aware of parallel structure anytime you see a list of 2 on the ACT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "It''s harder to lift the couch by myself than lifting it with some friends."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "It''s harder to lift the couch by myself than to lift it with some friends." (both use "to lift")</li>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">In addition to lists, there are certain special cases for parallel structure
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These are officially called <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">correlative conjunctions</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">They must have the same grammatical structure for both parts of the conjunction</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
The Four Main Correlative Conjunctions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Neither ___ nor ___
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The news report is neither accurate nor fair."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both blanks must have the same form (both adjectives here)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Either ___ or ___
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "You can either call me or text me."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both blanks must match (both verb phrases here)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Not only ___ but also ___
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is the most commonly tested correlative conjunction on the ACT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "My mother not only took away my keys but also locked them in the safe."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both blanks must match (both verb phrases here)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Both ___ and ___
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Both a scholar and an athlete, Sylvia got a scholarship to row crew in college."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both blanks must match (both noun phrases here)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
How to Check Parallel Structure with Correlative Conjunctions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Identify what comes immediately after the first part of the conjunction
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">What type of word or phrase follows "not only," "either," "neither," or "both"?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Check what comes immediately after the second part
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">What type of word or phrase follows "but also," "or," "nor," or "and"?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Make sure both parts match in grammatical form
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the first part has a verb phrase, the second must have a verb phrase</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the first part has a noun, the second must have a noun</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Lists connected by "and" or "or"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Comparisons using "than"</li>

Strategy for Parallel Structure Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 1: Identify that there''s a list or comparison
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for words like "and," "or," "than," or correlative conjunctions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 2: Find all the items in the list or comparison
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">How many items are there? What are they?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 3: Check the grammatical form of each item
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Is the first item a noun? Verb? Adjective? Phrase? Clause?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Are all the other items the same type?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 4: Choose the answer that makes all items match
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">All items must have the same grammatical structure</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Trust your ear—parallel structure usually "sounds right"</li>
    </ul>

2. Than vs. Then

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Than</strong> is ONLY used for comparisons
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "I think that chocolate with almonds is much better than ice cream."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Then</strong> has multiple meanings
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Used when dealing with time: "First we eat, then we clean up."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Means "in addition to": "I need to call my mother, and then we can leave."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Used with if/then statements: "If it rains, then we''ll stay inside."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Quick rule: For a comparison, use "than." Otherwise, use "then."</li>

3. Have vs. Of
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Many people mistakenly use "could of" or "would of"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is ALWAYS incorrect!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The correct forms are "could have" or "would have"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The words "could," "should," "would," and "might" should always be followed by "have," not "of"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The reason for this mistake: The contraction "could''ve" (short for "could have") is pronounced like "could of"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "If we left the show earlier, we could of avoided the traffic."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "If we left the show earlier, we could have avoided the traffic."</li>

</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For COUNTABLE nouns, use: number, many, fewer, few
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The number of ingredients" (you can count ingredients)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "How many trophies" (you can count trophies)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Fewer calories" (you can count calories)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "A few minutes" (you can count minutes)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For NON-COUNTABLE nouns, use: amount, much, less, little
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The amount of time" (you can''t count time itself)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "How much significance" (you can''t count significance)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Less whole milk" (you can''t count milk itself, only containers)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "A little time" (you can''t count time itself)</li>

5. Active Voice vs. Passive Voice
</h3>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Active voice</strong> means the subject performs the verb''s action
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "I picked up the pencil." (I performed the action)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The police chief announced the list of suspects." (The police chief performed the action)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Passive voice</strong> means the subject is acted upon by the verb
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The pencil was picked up by me." (The pencil didn''t do the action)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The list of suspects was announced by the police chief." (The list didn''t do the action)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">On the ACT, NEVER select an answer choice in passive voice
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Active voice is always better than passive voice</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Active voice is clearer, more direct, and stronger</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

6. Prepositional Idioms
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Idioms</strong> are expressions stated in a certain way because it''s widely accepted practice
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Certain words must be paired with certain prepositions to be correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These questions don''t come up often on the ACT</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When prepositional idioms appear, rely on what sounds best
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "Bobby was afraid by the dark."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: "Bobby was afraid of the dark."</li>

  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>"Affect" is a verb (to produce a change), while "effect" is a noun (the result of a change). "Than" is only for comparisons, while "then" is for time sequences or if/then statements. Always use "could have" not "could of"—the same applies to should, would, and might.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>For countable nouns (things you can count), use number, many, fewer, and few. For non-countable nouns (things you can''t count in plural form), use amount, much, less, and little. For example: "fewer calories" but "less milk."
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Active voice (where the subject performs the action) is always better than passive voice (where the subject is acted upon) on the ACT. Choose "I picked up the pencil" over "The pencil was picked up by me."
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Prepositional idioms pair specific words with specific prepositions (like "afraid of" not "afraid by"). These questions are rare—when they appear, trust what sounds right. Don''t try to memorize every idiom; focus on mastering other topics first.

Watch for these combinations: </p> <div style="border-left: 4px solid #f59e0b; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; background-color: #fffbeb;"> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Comma + Verb Agreement:</strong> Prepositional phrase between subject and verb, with comma placement <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Modifier + Pronoun:</strong> Dangling modifier where the pronoun reference is ambiguous <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Parallel + Verb Tense:</strong> List items with inconsistent verb forms </p> </div> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 2. Systematic Error Recognition Strategies </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Develop a consistent approach to every grammar question. This systematic method prevents you from missing errors and helps you work efficiently under time pressure. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Step 1: Read the Sentence Completely </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Always read from the beginning of the sentence (or previous sentence if needed) through the end. Context matters—you can''t identify tense errors, pronoun agreement, or modifier placement without understanding the full sentence. </p> <div style="border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; background-color: #f8fafc;"> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Why this matters:</strong> Many errors depend on elements outside the underlined portion. Subject-verb agreement requires finding the subject (often not underlined). Verb tense requires checking surrounding verbs. Pronoun clarity requires seeing the antecedent. </p> </div> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Step 2: Trust Your Ear, But Verify with Rules </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> If something sounds wrong, it probably is. However, some errors sound correct (like "everyone...their"), so verify with the rules you''ve learned. </p> <div style="border-left: 4px solid #16a34a; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; background-color: #f0fdf4;"> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Ear + Rules = Accuracy</strong> → If it sounds wrong: Identify which rule is violated → If it sounds right: Still check the Big 7 categories systematically </p> </div> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Step 3: Eliminate Obviously Wrong Answers </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Use process of elimination to narrow choices before identifying the specific error. </p> <div style="border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; background-color: #f8fafc;"> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Common eliminators:</strong> </p> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> • Creates a fragment or run-on • Uses wrong verb tense for the context • Creates pronoun agreement error • Breaks parallel structure in a list • Makes the sentence significantly more wordy without adding clarity </p> </div> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Step 4: Look for Visual Cues </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Certain patterns in the answer choices tell you what the question is testing. </p> <div style="border-left: 4px solid #f59e0b; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; background-color: #fffbeb;"> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Different punctuation marks?</strong> → Punctuation question <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Different verb forms?</strong> → Verb agreement or tense <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Different pronouns?</strong> → Pronoun agreement or case <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Sentence restructured?</strong> → Modifier placement or sentence structure <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Different word order in list?</strong> → Parallel structure </p> </div> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 3. Time Management and Pacing </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The ACT English section gives you 45 minutes for 75 questions across 5 passages.

If the shorter version creates an error or changes meaning, choose the longer correct option. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Avoid Extreme or Absolute Language </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> On rhetorical questions about adding/deleting information or main ideas, be wary of answer choices with extreme words like "always," "never," "only," "completely." </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Read Answer Choices Carefully </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The ACT loves to include answer choices that look similar but differ in one key detail. Read every word of each choice. </p> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Common trap:</strong> Three choices are identical except one uses "affects" and another uses "effects."

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Redundancy, wordiness, and irrelevance questions appear frequently on the ACT English Test. For these questions, the shortest and simplest answer choice that expresses the same idea is almost always correct—if anything is redundant, wordy, or irrelevant, eliminate it.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. Redundancy
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Redundancy</strong> occurs when information is unnecessarily repeated
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read the sentence itself AND the sentence(s) before to check for repeated information</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If two words or phrases mean the same thing, one must be removed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Common redundant phrases to watch for
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ "Returned back" → ✓ "Returned" (returning already means coming back)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ "In the Swedish forests" when Sweden was already mentioned → ✓ "In the forests"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ "Past history" → ✓ "History" (history is always past)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ "Free gift" → ✓ "Gift" (gifts are free by definition)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example: Context-Based Redundancy
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "In Sweden, there are about 300,000 to 400,000 moose, many of which stand over seven feet tall, roaming freely in the Swedish forests."</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">✓ Correct: "In Sweden, there are about 300,000 to 400,000 moose, many of which stand over 7 feet tall, roaming freely in the forests."</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Why: The sentence already specifies the moose are in Sweden, so "Swedish" is redundant</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Wordiness
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Sentences can be unnecessarily wordy without being redundant
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pick the answer choice that uses the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">fewest words</strong> to express the same idea</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Eliminate flowery or unnecessarily complex language</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Common wordy phrases and their concise alternatives
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ "Due to the fact that" → ✓ "Because"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ "At this point in time" → ✓ "Now"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ "In the event that" → ✓ "If"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">❌ "A cultural institution supporting intellectual endeavors related to renaissance art" → ✓ "A museum devoted to renaissance art"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example: Simplifying Wordy Phrases
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "The ancient Italian sculptures were donated to a cultural institution supporting intellectual endeavors related to renaissance art."</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">✓ Correct: "The ancient Italian sculptures were donated to a museum devoted to renaissance art."</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Why: The simpler version conveys the exact same meaning with far fewer words</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Irrelevance
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Irrelevant information</strong> doesn''t contribute to the passage''s main idea or current paragraph
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Irrelevant details most often appear as long, wordy answer choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These answer choices are always incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Ask: Does this information help tell the story or explain the concept?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example: Removing Irrelevant Details
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">❌ Incorrect: "To win the game, Ricky needed to make both free throws. Players are not allowed to step in the lane during a free throw attempt. He made the first one. The entire gym was quiet as he stepped to the line for the second."</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">✓ Correct: "To win the game, Ricky needed to make both free throws. He made the first one. The entire gym was quiet as he stepped to the line for the second."</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Why: The rule about stepping in the lane is irrelevant to Ricky''s specific free throw situation</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. How to Spot These Questions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The ACT directly tells you when testing redundancy, wordiness, or irrelevance
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for questions asking: "Which choice is the least redundant in context?"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Or: "Which choice best avoids wordiness and redundancy in context?"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When you see these questions, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">the shortest answer is almost always correct</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Important warning: ONLY use "shortest is correct" for these specific questions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">On grammar questions (not asking about redundancy), the shortest answer may be wrong</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: An ambiguous pronoun like "it" or "them" might be shortest but incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Always apply grammar rules first unless the question specifically asks about redundancy</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Recognizing Ambiguous Pronouns
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Even though pronouns are short, they''re incorrect if ambiguous
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Watch for: they, them, it, this, that, these, those, some, none</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you can''t tell exactly what the pronoun refers to, it''s incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Freddie ordered some" is ambiguous—some what? Coral? Aquariums?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Correct: "Freddie ordered some coral colonies" clearly specifies what he ordered</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="visibility: hidden; margin: 0; padding: 0; line-height: 0; height: 0;">
Hidden Separator
</h3>

<h3 style="color: #2e7d32; font-size: 1.4rem; font-weight: 700; margin: 3rem 0 1.5rem 0;">
Key Takeaways
</h3>

<ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Redundancy occurs when information is unnecessarily repeated—check the current sentence and previous sentences for duplicate information. Common examples: "returned back" (just "returned"), "Swedish forests" when Sweden was already mentioned (just "the forests").
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Wordiness means using more words than necessary to express an idea. Pick the answer choice with the fewest words that conveys the same meaning: "because" instead of "due to the fact that," "museum" instead of "cultural institution supporting intellectual endeavors."
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Irrelevant information doesn''t contribute to the passage''s main idea or current paragraph—these details often appear as long, wordy answer choices and are always incorrect. Ask yourself: does this information help tell the story or explain the concept?
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>The ACT directly asks "Which choice is the least redundant in context?" or "Which choice best avoids wordiness?" For THESE questions only, the shortest answer is almost always correct. However, on grammar questions, don''t always pick the shortest—ambiguous pronouns (it, them, some) may be short but incorrect.

2. How to Approach Word Choice Questions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Follow this three-step process
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Step 1:</strong> Read the sentence and surrounding sentences for context</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Step 2:</strong> Plug each word into the sentence one at a time</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Step 3:</strong> Pick the word that makes the most sense in context</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Context includes both meaning and tone
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Does the word''s definition fit logically?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Does the word''s formality level match the passage?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Does it create the intended relationship between ideas?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example Approach
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Question: "Adding solar panels to your house can <u>emit</u> huge savings on energy bills."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A. emit</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">B. claim</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">C. gift</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">D. result in</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Analysis
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Emit" means to send out or release—doesn''t fit with savings</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Claim" means to assert or demand—doesn''t make sense here</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Gift" is a noun, not a verb that fits this context</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Result in" means to cause or produce—this fits perfectly!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The answer is D because "result in" is the only phrase that logically completes the meaning</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Vocabulary Strategy
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Don''t assume the hardest word is correct
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sometimes the ACT includes challenging vocabulary you need to know</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Other times, challenging words are incorrect answer choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The difficulty level of the word doesn''t indicate if it''s right or wrong</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">What to do when you don''t know a word
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you know a word works, pick it—even if it seems easy</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Eliminate words you know are wrong</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you don''t know a word and have to guess, make your best guess and move on</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t spend too much time on vocabulary you don''t know</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Trust What You Know
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Your instinct about common words is usually correct
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If a simple word like "make" or "show" fits perfectly, it''s likely correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t overthink or assume you need a fancier word</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The ACT values precision and clarity, not complexity</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Common Word Choice Patterns
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Similar-sounding words with different meanings
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Affect (verb - to influence) vs. Effect (noun - result)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Elicit (to draw out) vs. Illicit (illegal)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Complement (to complete) vs. Compliment (to praise)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Words with similar meanings but different connotations
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Dispassionate (unemotional) vs. Disinterested (unbiased) vs. Unbiased (neutral)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Display (to show) vs. Reveal (to uncover) vs. Exhibit (to demonstrate)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Context determines which shade of meaning is correct</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Phrasal verbs and preposition choices
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Improved over" vs. "improved upon" vs. "improved above"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The correct preposition changes the meaning</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Trust what sounds natural in standard English</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Transition questions test your reading comprehension by asking you to select the word or phrase that best connects ideas between sentences. All answer choices will be grammatically correct, so you must read for context to determine which transition logically relates the ideas.

  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Context is everything
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You cannot determine the correct transition by reading only one sentence</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Always read both the previous and following sentences</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Type 1: All Four Choices Are Transitions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When all 4 answer choices are transitions, you''re only being tested on selecting the correct one
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read for context to understand the relationship</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Match the transition to the logical connection between ideas</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">"From a distance, the ocean looked pretty calm today even though a storm had arrived last night. <u>Under the circumstances,</u> the scene was much more chaotic with big waves and strong riptides."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A. NO CHANGE (Under the circumstances)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">B. For instance</li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">✓ Correct: C. "Up close" creates a contrast with "from a distance" in the previous sentence</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Type 2: Three Transitions and One "No Transition" Option
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When one choice has <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">no transition</strong>, the ACT is asking whether a transition is even necessary
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Most often, the correct answer is the one that removes the transition entirely</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Only use a transition if it properly links the sentences</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the ideas flow naturally without a transition, choose the "no transition" option</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
When to Remove Transitions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Remove the transition if:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The sentences are simply continuing the same idea</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The relationship is already clear without a transition word</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Adding a transition makes the connection awkward or incorrect</li>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Adding or deleting information questions ask whether specific information should be included in a passage or not. For these questions, you must read for context—we recommend reading the entire paragraph where the question appears to determine if the information fits.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. How to Approach These Questions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Read the paragraph <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">twice</strong>: once with the information included and once with it deleted
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This makes it clear whether the information should be included</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Consider: Does the information fit the paragraph''s focus?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Depending on the question, you may need to read more than one paragraph</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Context is critical
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You must understand what the paragraph is discussing</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The information should support or relate to the main idea</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Adding Information Questions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">These questions give you a sentence or phrase and ask if it should be added
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Answer choices have two parts: (1) Yes or No, (2) Justification why</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">First decide yes or no, then pick the correct justification</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Critical Strategy: Only Consider What the Sentence Says
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When evaluating justifications, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">only consider the sentence being added</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Many students pick justifications that go far beyond what the sentence says</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t include details that have nothing to do with the sentence itself</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The justification must accurately describe what that specific sentence provides</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example Structure
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Question: "Should the writer add this sentence about Dr. Anderson''s education?"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A. Yes, because it establishes Dr. Paul''s mentor''s qualifications</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">B. Yes, because it indicates Dr. Anderson had a top-notch education</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">C. No, because it does not indicate where Dr. Paul studied</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">D. No, because it is not relevant to the passage''s discussion of Dr. Paul''s career</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">If the passage is about Dr. Paul''s career, not his mentor''s, the answer is D</li>
</ul>

3. Deleting Information Questions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">These ask if <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">existing information should be removed</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Same format: Yes/No + Justification</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Consider whether the information is relevant and necessary</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
When to Delete Information
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Delete when the information:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Is irrelevant to the paragraph''s main idea</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Repeats information already stated</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Distracts from the paragraph''s focus</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Doesn''t add anything meaningful</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Keep when the information:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Supports the main idea</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Provides necessary detail or clarification</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Connects ideas within the paragraph</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Common Answer Choice Patterns
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Good justifications are <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">specific and accurate</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">They describe exactly what the sentence provides</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">They relate to the paragraph''s focus</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "provides specific detail about the location" (if the sentence actually does that)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Bad justifications are vague or go too far
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">They claim the sentence says more than it actually does</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">They focus on irrelevant details</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "proves the scientist was the best in his field" (when sentence only mentions one achievement)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Common Wrong Answer Traps
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Watch out for justifications that:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Reference information NOT in the sentence being added/deleted</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Make logical leaps beyond what the sentence states</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Focus on the wrong person, topic, or idea</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use absolute language ("proves," "always," "never") when the sentence is less definitive</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

Logical placement questions ask you to place a sentence in the paragraph based on context and logical flow. These questions test your ability to recognize where information fits best by reading the sentences before and after each potential placement spot.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. How to Identify These Questions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Logical placement questions are easy to spot because they always ask <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">where to place a sentence</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Common phrasing: "For the sake of logic and coherence, Sentence X should be placed..."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Or: "The sentence would most logically be placed..."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Look for <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">bracketed numbers [1] [2] [3]</strong> at the beginning of sentences
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Bracketed numbers only appear when there''s a logical placement question</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read these paragraphs more carefully—they may currently be out of order</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The paragraph may seem confusing at first because sentences are misplaced</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Bracketed letters [A] [B] [C] appear for end-of-passage placement questions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t worry about the letters while reading—just note there will be a placement question</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The question will ask where to place a new sentence in the passage</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

2. The Critical Strategy: Plug and Read
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">To find the correct answer, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">plug the sentence into each potential spot</strong> and re-read
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t just read the sentence before the placement—this is the most common mistake</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You MUST read the sentence(s) before AND after where you''re placing it</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The correct placement should flow smoothly in both directions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Step-by-Step Approach
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 1: Read the entire paragraph first to understand the overall context
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Even if it seems confusing, get a sense of the topic and flow</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Identify what the paragraph is discussing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 2: Identify the sentence you need to place
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">What specific information does it contain?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">What does it refer to or connect to?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 3: Test each answer choice by plugging in the sentence
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read from the sentence before → through the placed sentence → to the sentence after</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Does it create smooth, logical flow?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Do pronouns have clear references?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Does the information follow a logical sequence?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

3. What Makes a Placement Correct
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The correct placement creates <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">logical flow and coherence</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Information should follow a natural, chronological, or logical order</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pronouns should refer to clearly established nouns</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Transition words should make sense in context</li>

</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Not reading the sentence AFTER the placement
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is the #1 mistake students make</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You must check that the sentence flows into what comes next</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A sentence might connect well to what comes before but not to what comes after</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Not reading the entire paragraph first
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You need context to understand where the sentence fits</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Without reading the whole paragraph, you might miss important clues</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Choosing based on topic similarity alone
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Just because two sentences discuss the same topic doesn''t mean they belong together</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Check for logical sequence and smooth transitions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Rushing through the answer choices
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Take time to actually plug in the sentence at each spot</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read the surrounding sentences carefully for each option</li>

</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">You MUST memorize these area formulas—they are NOT provided on the ACT:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Triangle</strong>: A = ½bh (where b = base, h = height)</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Common mistakes to avoid:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For parallelograms, use the HEIGHT (perpendicular distance), not the slanted side length</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For circles, make sure you have the radius, not the diameter (if given diameter, divide by 2)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For triangles, the height must be perpendicular to the base</li>
    </ul>

2. Volume Formulas and Unit Conversions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Essential volume formulas to memorize:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Rectangular Prism (box)</strong>: V = lwh</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Cube</strong>: V = s³</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Right Cylinder</strong>: V = πr²h</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Any 3D shape</strong>: V = Bh (where B = area of base, h = height)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Surface area formulas (less common but important):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Rectangular Prism</strong>: SA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Cube</strong>: SA = 6s²</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>CRITICAL: Unit conversions</strong>—The ACT frequently tests these, and students make costly mistakes:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Always convert units BEFORE calculating area or volume</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">1 yard = 3 feet</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">1 foot = 12 inches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">1 square yard = 9 square feet (not 3!)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">1 square foot = 144 square inches (not 12!)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">1 cubic yard = 27 cubic feet (not 3!)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">1 cubic foot = 1,728 cubic inches (not 12!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Why you must convert FIRST:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: A field is 136 yards × 93 yards. To find area in square feet:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ CORRECT: Convert to feet first: (136 × 3) × (93 × 3) = 408 × 279 = 113,832 ft²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✗ WRONG: Calculate area then convert: 136 × 93 = 12,648, then × 9 = wrong answer!</li>
    </ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Pythagorean theorem</strong> applies ONLY to right triangles:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>a² + b² = c²</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Where a and b are the legs (the two shorter sides)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">c is the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">hypotenuse</strong> (the longest side, opposite the right angle)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Pythagorean triples</strong>—memorize these to save time:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>3-4-5 triangle</strong>: If you see sides of 3 and 4, the hypotenuse is 5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>5-12-13 triangle</strong>: If you see sides of 5 and 12, the hypotenuse is 13</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These can be scaled up: 6-8-10, 9-12-15, 10-24-26, etc.</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you recognize a Pythagorean triple, you can skip the calculation entirely</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When to use Pythagorean theorem:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">

</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>45-45-90 triangle</strong> (also called a right isosceles triangle):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Side ratio: <strong>x : x : x√2</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The two legs are equal (both length x)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The hypotenuse is x√2 (one leg times √2)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the leg is 5, the hypotenuse is 5√2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the hypotenuse is 10, each leg is 10/√2 = 5√2</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>30-60-90 triangle</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Side ratio: <strong>x : x√3 : 2x</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Short leg (opposite 30°): x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Long leg (opposite 60°): x√3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Hypotenuse (opposite 90°): 2x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>KEY RULE:</strong> The short leg is always half the hypotenuse</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the hypotenuse is 10, the short leg is 5, and the long leg is 5√3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">How to recognize special right triangles:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for angle measurements (45°, 30°, 60°)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for the phrase "right isosceles triangle" (45-45-90)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for equilateral triangles split in half (creates 30-60-90)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you see √2 or √3 in the answer choices, it''s likely a special right triangle</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When to use special right triangles instead of Pythagorean theorem:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When you see the special angles (30°, 45°, 60°)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When the answer choices contain √2 or √3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Special triangles are FASTER than using a² + b² = c²</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

5. Test-Taking Tips for Geometry Problems
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Draw and label diagrams</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If no diagram is provided, draw one yourself</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Label all given measurements directly on the diagram</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Mark right angles with a small square</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Write formulas next to the shapes as you work</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Look for Pythagorean triples first</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Before using a² + b² = c², check if the sides are a Pythagorean triple</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Common ones: 3-4-5, 5-12-13, 8-15-17, and their multiples</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This saves time and prevents calculation errors</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Use substitution for complex problems</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If a problem uses variables (like "a field is l feet by w feet"), pick simple numbers</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Let l = 4 and w = 3, then solve with those specific values</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This makes algebraic area/volume problems much easier to visualize</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Convert units before calculating</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">NEVER calculate area in yards and then convert to square feet</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ALWAYS convert the length and width first, then calculate</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Write out the conversion as a separate step to avoid mistakes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Memorize formulas NOW, not the night before</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Make flashcards for all area and volume formulas</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Practice drawing and labeling 45-45-90 and 30-60-90 triangles from memory</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Review Pythagorean triples until you can recognize them instantly</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Alternative method: Plug point into y = mx + b
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A, B, and C are constants (usually integers)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">To find slope from standard form: slope = -A/B</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">To find y-intercept: set x = 0 and solve for y</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">To find x-intercept: set y = 0 and solve for x</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The distance formula IS the Pythagorean theorem</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The two points form a right triangle with legs (x₁ - x₂) and (y₁ - y₂)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The distance is the hypotenuse</li>

</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Always convert to y = mx + b when possible</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Slope-intercept form is the easiest to work with</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If given standard form, solve for y immediately</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If given point-slope form, distribute and solve for y</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>For perpendicular lines, flip and negate the slope</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Perpendicular slope = -1 / (original slope)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If slope is 2, perpendicular is -1/2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If slope is -3/4, perpendicular is 4/3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Use substitution to verify equations</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If given a point and asked which equation represents the line, plug the point into each answer choice</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The correct equation will make the point satisfy the equation</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This can be faster than calculating slope and y-intercept</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Draw quick sketches for visual problems</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">

</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. Understanding Arcs
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">An <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">arc</strong> is a portion of a circle''s circumference
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Think of it as a "slice" of the circle''s edge</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Arcs are measured in two ways: degree measure or arc length</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Degree measure of an arc:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Equal to the measure of the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">central angle</strong> that intercepts it</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: If the central angle is 90°, the arc measures 90°</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Arc length (the actual distance along the curve):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Arc length is a portion of the total circumference</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use the proportion: arc length / circumference = angle / 360°</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Arc length formula (MEMORIZE THIS):</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Arc Length = (θ/360°) × 2πr</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Where θ = central angle in degrees</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">r = radius of the circle</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">2πr = circumference of the whole circle</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Alternative form (same formula):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Arc Length / Circumference = θ / 360°</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This proportion shows: arc is to whole circle as angle is to 360°</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Useful when you need to solve for the angle or radius</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">sector</strong> is a "slice" of a circle (like a pizza slice)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Bounded by two radii and an arc</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sectors have area, just like the whole circle has area</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Sector area formula (MEMORIZE THIS):</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Sector Area = (θ/360°) × πr²</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Where θ = central angle in degrees</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">r = radius of the circle</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">πr² = area of the whole circle</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Alternative form (proportion):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Sector Area / Circle Area = θ / 360°</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This shows: sector is to whole circle as angle is to 360°</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Key pattern to recognize:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Arc length uses circumference (2πr)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sector area uses circle area (πr²)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both use the same proportion: (θ/360°)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The key insight: the arc/sector is a fraction of the whole circle</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">That fraction equals the central angle divided by 360°</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: A 90° angle means 90/360 = 1/4 of the circle</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Don''t confuse arc length with sector area</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Arc length is distance (1-dimensional) - uses circumference</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sector area is space (2-dimensional) - uses circle area</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read the question carefully to determine which one is asked</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Memorize the formulas now</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Arc length = (θ/360°) × 2πr</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sector area = (θ/360°) × πr²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These are NOT provided on the test</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Use the proportion setup for complex problems</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Arc/Circumference = Angle/360° is easier to manipulate algebraically</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Especially useful when solving for the angle or radius</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cross-multiply to solve</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Simplify the fraction θ/360° early</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">90/360 = 1/4, 120/360 = 1/3, 180/360 = 1/2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This makes calculations much simpler</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (90/360) × 2π(12) = (1/4) × 24π = 6π</li>
    </ul>

Logarithms appear 1-2 times per ACT Math test, usually testing your ability to convert between <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">logarithmic form</strong> and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">exponential form</strong>. Understanding this conversion is the key to solving almost all logarithm questions on the ACT.

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. Basics of Logarithms (Converting Between Forms)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The fundamental relationship between logs and exponents:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>log_a(b) = c</strong> is the same as <strong>a^c = b</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Where a is the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">base</strong>, c is the exponent, and b is the result</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both equations describe the exact same relationship—just different notation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Examples of converting from <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">logarithmic form</strong> to <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">exponential form</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">log₃(3) = 1 → 3¹ = 3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">log₃(9) = 2 → 3² = 9</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">log₃(27) = 3 → 3³ = 27</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The pattern: "log base 3 of 27 equals 3" means "3 to the 3rd power equals 27"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">How to solve logarithm equations:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Convert from logarithmic form to exponential form</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Solve the exponential equation using exponent rules</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: When log₄(x) = 3, what is x?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Convert: 4³ = x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solve: x = 64</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">CRITICAL strategy:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Almost ALL ACT logarithm questions are solved by converting to exponential form</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you can convert, you can solve the problem</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Practice this conversion until it''s automatic!</li>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Using Your Calculator (Change of Base Rule)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">change of base rule</strong> lets you use a calculator:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>log_b(a) = log(a) / log(b)</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This converts ANY logarithm to base 10 (which calculators can compute)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: log₃(9) = log(9) / log(3) = 0.954 / 0.477 = 2</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Using the change of base rule on your calculator:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">To find log₃(9): Enter log(9) ÷ log(3) in calculator</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">To find log₂(8): Enter log(8) ÷ log(2) in calculator</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This works for ANY base and ANY value</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Some calculators have a built-in logbase function:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>TI-83/84:</strong> Press MATH, scroll to LOGBASE</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This allows direct entry: logbase(3, 9) = 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Check if your calculator has this feature—it''s faster!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Calculator method vs. algebraic method:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For simple bases (2, 3, 4, 5): Converting to exponential form is often faster</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For complex problems with multiple logs: Use change of base rule</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 5(log₃(9) + log₂(8)) can be solved entirely with calculator</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Logarithm Rules (For Advanced Questions)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Four logarithm rules you should know:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Product Rule:</strong> log_a(xy) = log_a(x) + log_a(y)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Quotient Rule:</strong> log_a(x/y) = log_a(x) - log_a(y)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Power Rule:</strong> log_a(x^n) = n·log_a(x)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Log of 1:</strong> log_a(1) = 0 (because a⁰ = 1)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When to use these rules:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These appear RARELY on the ACT (1-2 times per test, if at all)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Most often on the LAST 10 questions (hardest section)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Students aiming for 30+ should memorize these</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Other students can skip—focus on conversion first!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example using power rule:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If log₉(3^x) = 3/2, what is x?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use power rule: x·log₉(3) = 3/2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Find log₉(3) using change of base: log(3)/log(9) = 1/2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Substitute: x·(1/2) = 3/2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solve: x = 3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Shortcut - backsolving with calculator:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If answer choices are given, plug each one in</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use change of base rule to evaluate both sides</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The correct answer makes both sides equal</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is often faster than using logarithm rules!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Natural Logarithms (ln)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Natural logarithms</strong> use base e (approximately 2.71828):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>ln(b) = c</strong> is the same as <strong>e^c = b</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The base "e" is invisible—it''s always e for natural logs</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ln is just shorthand notation for log_e</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Natural logarithms appear VERY rarely:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Usually only in the last 5-10 questions (hardest section)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Students rushing through can skip this topic entirely</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Students aiming for 30+ should learn the basics</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Solving natural logarithm equations:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: If ln(x-1) = 3, then x = ?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Convert to exponential form: e³ = x-1</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Solve for x: x = e³ + 1</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Same conversion strategy as regular logarithms!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">All logarithm rules work for natural logs too:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ln(xy) = ln(x) + ln(y)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ln(x/y) = ln(x) - ln(y)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ln(x^n) = n·ln(x)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ln(1) = 0</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Use your calculator with the change of base rule</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">log_b(a) = log(a) / log(b) works for ANY logarithm</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This lets you evaluate complex expressions quickly</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Check if your calculator has a built-in logbase function</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Backsolve when answer choices are given</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Plug each answer choice into the original equation</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use change of base rule to evaluate on calculator</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Often faster than using logarithm rules algebraically</li>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Target score below 28: Focus ONLY on conversion and change of base</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Target score 28-32: Memorize the four logarithm rules</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Target score 33+: Learn natural logarithms too</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t waste time on rare topics if you need basics first!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Remember: logarithms are just another form of exponents</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you understand exponents well, logarithms become easier</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The conversion is the bridge between the two</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If (y + 5), the center y-coordinate is -5 (opposite sign!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Finding the radius:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">r² is on the right side of the equation</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (x - 2)² + (y - 1)² = 25 has r² = 25, so r = 5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (x + 1)² + (y - 3)² = 100 has r² = 100, so r = 10</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t forget to take the square root!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Special case - circle centered at origin:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>x² + y² = r²</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Center: (0, 0)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: x² + y² = 49 is centered at origin with radius 7</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Writing the equation when given center and radius:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Center (3, -2) and radius 5: (x - 3)² + (y + 2)² = 25</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Center (-4, 7) and radius 6: (x + 4)² + (y - 7)² = 36</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Remember to square the radius!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

2. Completing the Square for Circles
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Sometimes circle equations are given in <strong>expanded form</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: x² + 4x + y² - 8y + 5 = 0</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This doesn''t look like standard form!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You must <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">complete the square</strong> to find center and radius</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Steps to complete the square:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Group x terms and y terms: (x² + 4x) + (y² - 8y) = -5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: For x terms, take half of coefficient of x, square it: (4/2)² = 4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: For y terms, take half of coefficient of y, square it: (-8/2)² = 16</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: Add these to both sides: (x² + 4x + 4) + (y² - 8y + 16) = -5 + 4 + 16</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 5: Factor: (x + 2)² + (y - 4)² = 15</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Now you can read center (-2, 4) and radius √15</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Quick formula for completing the square:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For x² + bx, add (b/2)²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This creates a perfect square: (x + b/2)²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Same process for y terms</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Ellipses and Hyperbolas (Basic Recognition)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Ellipse</strong> standard form:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>(x - h)²/a² + (y - k)²/b² = 1</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Center: (h, k), just like a circle</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Looks like a stretched or compressed circle</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both terms are added (+), both squared</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (x - 2)²/9 + (y + 1)²/4 = 1 is centered at (2, -1)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Hyperbola</strong> standard form:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>(x - h)²/a² - (y - k)²/b² = 1</strong> or <strong>(y - k)²/b² - (x - h)²/a² = 1</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Center: (h, k)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Has two separate curved branches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Key difference: One term is subtracted (-)</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (x - 3)²/16 - (y + 2)²/9 = 1 is centered at (3, -2)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">How to identify which conic section:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Circle</strong>: x² and y² have same coefficient, added together</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Ellipse</strong>: x² and y² have different coefficients, added together</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Hyperbola</strong>: x² and y² are subtracted</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">On the ACT:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Circles are tested most frequently</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Ellipses and hyperbolas appear 0-2 times per test</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Usually just need to identify center or general shape</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Deep knowledge of ellipse/hyperbola properties rarely needed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Test-Taking Tips for Conic Sections
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Master the circle equation first</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">(x - h)² + (y - k)² = r² is the most tested formula</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Practice reading the center until automatic</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Remember: opposite signs! (x - 3) means center x = 3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Watch for completing the square questions</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the equation isn''t in standard form, you''ll need to complete the square</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Take half the coefficient, square it, add to both sides</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t forget to move the constant to the other side first!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Use the signs to identify the conic</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both terms positive (+)? Circle or ellipse</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">One term negative (-)? Hyperbola</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This quick check eliminates wrong answers fast</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Radius is always positive</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">r² = 25 means r = 5 (not ±5)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Radius cannot be negative in geometry</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Memorize the standard forms</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Circle: (x-h)²+(y-k)²=r²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Ellipse: (x-h)²/a²+(y-k)²/b²=1</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Hyperbola: (x-h)²/a²-(y-k)²/b²=1</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These formulas are NOT provided on the test</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

1. What Is Backsolving?
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Backsolving</strong> means plugging answer choices into the problem to find which one works
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Instead of setting up equations and solving for x, you test each choice</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Transforms complex algebra into simple arithmetic</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Works by substituting values until you find one that satisfies all conditions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Key advantages over traditional algebra:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Often faster than setting up and solving complex equations</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Less likely to make calculation errors with concrete numbers</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Can verify your answer immediately</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Works even if you struggle with algebra</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Answer choices</strong> are concrete numbers, not <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">algebraic expressions</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">

2. The Strategic Backsolving Process
</h3>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 1: Strategic Starting
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Use the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">middle value strategy</strong> to maximize efficiency
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ACT always lists answer choices in ascending or descending order</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Begin with choice B or C (middle values)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If C is too big, eliminate D and E as well</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If C is too small, eliminate A and B as well</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This lets you eliminate 2-3 choices with one test</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 2: Test Your Chosen Answer
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Substitute the value into all problem conditions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Check: Does it make the equation true?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Check: Does it satisfy all constraints?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Check: Does it produce the correct result?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 3: If It Works, You''re Done
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Bubble in your answer and move on
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t waste time double-checking or testing other choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ACT only has one correct answer per question</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 4: Eliminate and Adjust
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">If the answer doesn''t work, cross it off immediately
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Determine if you need a larger or smaller value</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">systematic elimination</strong> to rule out other choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use logic to narrow down remaining options</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 5: Repeat
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Test remaining choices systematically
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Continue until you find the answer that works</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Remember: exactly one of the five choices must work</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Core algebra skills appear on almost every ACT Math question, from simple equation solving to complex multi-step problems. Mastering <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">PEMDAS</strong>, negative numbers, and combining like terms is essential for avoiding careless mistakes and solving problems quickly.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. PEMDAS (Order of Operations)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">PEMDAS</strong> is the order you MUST follow when solving expressions:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>P</strong> - Parentheses: Complete calculations inside parentheses first</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>E</strong> - Exponents: Next, complete any exponents or square roots</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>MD</strong> - Multiplication and Division: Work LEFT TO RIGHT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>AS</strong> - Addition and Subtraction: Work LEFT TO RIGHT</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>CRITICAL: Work left-to-right for MD and AS</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is where the ACT tricks students most often!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 16 ÷ 4 × 2 - 3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: 16 ÷ 4 × 2 - 3 = 4 × 2 - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✗ Wrong: Don''t do 4 × 2 first! That gives 16 ÷ 8 - 3 = -1 (incorrect)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Calculator shortcut:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Your calculator is programmed to follow PEMDAS automatically</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Enter the expression exactly as written and let the calculator solve it</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This prevents order of operations mistakes</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Make sure to use parentheses when needed!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Common PEMDAS mistakes to avoid:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Doing multiplication before division (or vice versa) instead of left-to-right</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Forgetting to complete parentheses first</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Doing exponents after multiplication/division</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Working with Negative Numbers
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The ACT LOVES negative number questions—these are prime mistake opportunities
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Students make more careless errors with negatives than any other topic</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Take extra care and write out every step</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Subtracting negative numbers:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Subtracting a negative = adding a positive</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 2 - (-4) = 2 + 4 = 6</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Think: "minus a minus is a plus"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Distributing negative signs (HUGE mistake area):</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You MUST distribute the negative to ALL terms in parentheses</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 5x - (2x - 5)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Correct: 5x - 2x - (-5) = 5x - 2x + 5 = 3x + 5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✗ Wrong: 5x - 2x - 5 = 3x - 5 (forgot to distribute to the -5!)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The negative sign affects BOTH the 2x AND the -5</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Negative numbers and exponents (another huge trap):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>-x² is NOT the same as (-x)²</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">-x²: Square x first, then make it negative → -x² = -(x²)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">(-x)²: Square the entire negative x → (-x)² = (-x)(-x) = x²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: -2² = -(2²) = -4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (-2)² = (-2)(-2) = 4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Calculator tip: ALWAYS use parentheses around negative numbers!</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Combining Like Terms
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Like terms have the same variable raised to the same power:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">3x and 5x are like terms → can be combined to 8x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">2x² and 4x² are like terms → can be combined to 6x²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">3x and 5x² are NOT like terms → cannot be combined</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Constants (numbers without variables) can always be combined</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Steps for combining like terms:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Distribute any parentheses</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Group like terms together</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Add or subtract the coefficients</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: Simplify the expression</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: 2(3x - 6) + 3y = 6x - y + 8, solve for y:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Distribute: 6x - 12 + 3y = 6x - y + 8</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The 6x terms cancel on both sides</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Simplify: -12 + 3y = -y + 8</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Combine: 4y = 20</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solve: y = 5</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When to combine like terms:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Always simplify equations before solving</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Combining like terms reduces the equation to its simplest form</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This makes it easier to see what to do next</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Cross-Multiplying Fractions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When two fractions are equal, you can <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">cross-multiply</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If x/y = z/w, then xw = yz</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Multiply the numerator of each fraction by the denominator of the other</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This eliminates the fractions and gives you a simpler equation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Visual representation:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">x/y = z/w</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cross-multiply diagonally: x × w and y × z</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Result: xw = yz</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: If x/4 = 6/7, solve for x:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cross-multiply: 7x = 4(6)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Simplify: 7x = 24</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solve: x = 24/7</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When to use cross-multiplication:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When you have one fraction equal to another fraction</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is the fastest way to eliminate fractions</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Much faster than finding common denominators</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
5. Test-Taking Tips for Algebra Skills
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Write out every step—do NOT do mental math</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Careless errors happen when you skip steps</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Writing forces you to be careful with negative signs</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You can check your work if you write it out</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Use your calculator strategically</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For PEMDAS problems: enter the entire expression</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ALWAYS use parentheses around negative numbers</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Double-check your calculator entry matches the problem</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Circle or underline negative signs</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Makes them more visible so you don''t forget them</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Especially important when distributing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Test your answer with substitution</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you solved for x, plug your answer back into the original equation</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Does it make the equation true? Then you''re correct!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This catches algebra mistakes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Master the basics before moving to advanced topics</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These fundamental skills appear in EVERY algebra problem</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You cannot do advanced algebra without mastering these basics</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Practice until negative numbers and PEMDAS are automatic</li>

1. Solving Algebraic Inequalities
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Treat inequality signs (<, >, ≤, ≥) like an equals sign:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use all normal algebra rules: add, subtract, combine like terms</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Isolate the variable just like solving equations</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The inequality sign stays the same for most operations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>CRITICAL RULE: Flip the sign when multiplying or dividing by a negative</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is the #1 mistake students make with inequalities!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: -2x + 5 < 11</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Subtract 5: -2x < 6</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Divide by -2: x > -3 (sign flipped from < to >!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When NOT to flip the sign:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ONLY flip when you multiply or divide BOTH SIDES by a negative</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t flip just because you see a negative number somewhere!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 3x + 6 > x - 4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Combine: 2x > -10</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Divide by 2 (positive): x > -5 (sign stays the same!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step-by-step process:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Move all variable terms to one side</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Move all number terms to the other side</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Combine like terms</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: Divide to isolate variable (flip sign if dividing by negative!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Two types of circles on number lines:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Open circle (○):</strong> Use for > and < (strict inequalities)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The endpoint is NOT included in the solution</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: x > 3 has an open circle at 3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Solid circle (●):</strong> Use for ≥ and ≤ (inclusive inequalities)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The endpoint IS included in the solution</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: x ≥ 3 has a solid circle at 3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Which direction to shade:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Greater than (> or ≥):</strong> Shade to the RIGHT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: x ≥ 10/3 → solid circle at 10/3, shade right</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Less than (< or ≤):</strong> Shade to the LEFT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: x < -5 → open circle at -5, shade left</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Quick memory trick:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The inequality sign "points" to the smaller values</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">So x > 3 means x is to the RIGHT of 3 (bigger values)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">And x < 3 means x is to the LEFT of 3 (smaller values)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

3. Graphing Linear Inequalities in the Coordinate Plane
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Three-step process for graphing linear inequalities:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Rearrange into y = mx + b form (slope-intercept)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Plot the line (dashed or solid based on inequality)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Shade the solution region (above or below the line)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Dashed vs. solid lines:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Dashed line:</strong> Use for > and < (strict inequalities)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Points ON the line are NOT part of the solution</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Solid line:</strong> Use for ≥ and ≤ (inclusive inequalities)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Points ON the line ARE part of the solution</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Where to shade:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Greater than (> or ≥):</strong> Shade ABOVE the line</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: y ≥ 2x + 3 → solid line, shade above</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Less than (< or ≤):</strong> Shade BELOW the line</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: y < -x + 2 → dashed line, shade below</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Graph 2x + 3y ≥ 6
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Solve for y: 3y ≥ -2x + 6 → y ≥ (-2/3)x + 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Draw solid line (because of ≥)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Shade above the line (because of ≥)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

4. Systems of Inequalities and Advanced Graphing
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Systems of inequalities (multiple inequalities on same graph):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Graph each inequality separately on the same coordinate plane</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The solution is where the shaded regions OVERLAP</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: y < 2x - 4 AND y > -(1/3)x - 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Graph both lines, shade both regions, find the overlap</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Parabola inequalities (follow same rules as lines):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Greater than (> or ≥):</strong> Shade ABOVE the parabola</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Less than (< or ≤):</strong> Shade BELOW the parabola</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use dashed curve for > and <, solid curve for ≥ and ≤</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Circle and ellipse inequalities (different shading rules):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Greater than (> or ≥):</strong> Shade OUTSIDE the circle/ellipse</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (x-2)² + (y-1)² > 4 → shade outside the circle</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Less than (< or ≤):</strong> Shade INSIDE the circle/ellipse</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (x-2)²/4 + (y-1)²/9 ≤ 1 → shade inside the ellipse</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When you''ll see advanced inequalities:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Parabola/circle/ellipse inequalities appear in the LAST 10 questions</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These are for students aiming for 30+ scores</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Master linear inequalities first before worrying about these!</li>

5. Test-Taking Tips for Inequalities
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Write "FLIP SIGN" when dividing by negatives</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is the most common mistake on inequality questions</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Circle any negative you''re dividing by to remind yourself</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Double-check the final sign before selecting your answer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Use test points to check your graph shading</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pick a point in the shaded region (like (0,0) if it''s not on the line)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Plug it into the original inequality</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If it makes the inequality true, you shaded correctly!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If false, you shaded the wrong side</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Remember: Open vs solid circles/lines</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">< and > → open circle/dashed line</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">≤ and ≥ → solid circle/solid line</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ACT answer choices often differ only in this detail!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>For systems, look for the overlap</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The solution to a system is where ALL shaded regions overlap</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is usually the darkest shaded area on the graph</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Test a point in the overlap to verify it satisfies all inequalities</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Circle/ellipse shading is opposite of parabola/line shading</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Lines/parabolas: > means shade above</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Circles/ellipses: > means shade outside</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This catches many students—don''t mix them up!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

1. What Is Number Substitution?
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Number substitution</strong> means replacing variables with simple numbers to solve problems using arithmetic instead of complex algebra
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Do you prefer working with numbers or variables? Most students prefer numbers!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Instead of manipulating <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">algebraic expressions</strong>, you work with concrete values</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Transform intimidating variable problems into straightforward arithmetic</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Why this strategy is so powerful:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Questions with many unknown <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">variables</strong> and few numbers often intimidate students</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Working with real numbers is faster and less error-prone than abstract algebra</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You can verify your answer immediately by checking it against the original problem</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Works even if you struggle with complex algebraic manipulation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. The 4-Step Substitution Process
</h3>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 1: Pick Numbers for Variables
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Choose simple, easy-to-work-with numbers
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Avoid 0 and 1</strong> — these can lead to incorrect answers that seem to work</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Use 2, 3, 4, or 5</strong> — small numbers that are easy to calculate with</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Special cases:</strong> Use 10 for percent problems, 10 or 20 for group size problems</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Select different numbers for each variable
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If a question has x and y, pick x = 2 and y = 3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Using different values prevents confusion and ensures accurate results</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Follow any rules stated in the question
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If x must be negative and even, pick x = -2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If y must be greater than x, make sure your chosen values satisfy this</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pay attention to constraints like "positive integers" or "odd numbers"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 2: Write Down Your Numbers
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Record your chosen values clearly
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Write them in your test booklet or scratch paper</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This prevents mistakes when plugging into <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">answer choices</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You''ll need to reference these values multiple times</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 3: Solve Using Your Numbers
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Work through the question using your chosen values
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Replace all variables with the numbers you picked</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Calculate step-by-step using basic arithmetic</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Find your numerical answer to the question</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 4: Test Answer Choices
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Plug your numbers into each answer choice
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The correct answer will match the numerical answer you found in Step 3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Only ONE answer choice will produce your target number</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Once you find the match, you''re done — bubble it in and move on!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

3. When to Use Number Substitution
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Question asks "which of the following" or "in terms of..."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Looking for an expression in terms of variables (m, n, x, y, etc.)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The question describes a situation with variables, not specific numbers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Answer choices</strong> contain variables or expressions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✓ Choices like "0.7nm", "2x + 3", "5(x + 3)"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">✗ NOT for choices that are just numbers like 2, 5, 7, 10</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Question has multiple variables with no concrete numbers
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Problems like "n boxes with m items each"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Scenarios involving undefined quantities</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The algebra looks messy or time-consuming
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Setting up equations with variables would take too long</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Substitution often provides a faster path to the answer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

1. Combining Fractions (Adding and Subtracting)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">To add or subtract fractions, you MUST have the same denominator:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You cannot add 1/2 + 2/5 directly—the denominators are different</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">First find the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">least common denominator</strong> (LCD)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Then add or subtract the numerators while keeping the denominator the same</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Quick trick for finding the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">least common denominator</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Multiply the denominators together</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: For 1/2 + 2/5, LCD = 2 × 5 = 10</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This always works, even if it''s not the smallest possible denominator</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">On the ACT, any common denominator is fine—you don''t need the smallest one</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step-by-step process for combining fractions:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 1/2 + 2/5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Find LCD = 2 × 5 = 10</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Convert each fraction: 1/2 = 5/10, and 2/5 = 4/10</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Add numerators: 5/10 + 4/10 = 9/10</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Fractions with variables in denominators (harder but same concept):</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 1/x + 3/(x-4)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">LCD = x(x-4) [multiply the denominators]</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Multiply first fraction by (x-4)/(x-4): (x-4)/[x(x-4)]</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Multiply second fraction by x/x: 3x/[x(x-4)]</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Add: (x-4+3x)/[x(x-4)] = (4x-4)/[x(x-4)]</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Dividing Fractions ("Keep, Flip, Change")
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The <strong>"Keep, Flip, Change"</strong> method for dividing fractions:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Keep</strong> the first fraction exactly as it is</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Flip</strong> the second fraction (take the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">reciprocal</strong>)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Change</strong> the division sign to multiplication</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (2/3) ÷ (4/5) = (2/3) × (5/4) = 10/12 = 5/6</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">This works even when dividing a fraction by a whole number:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (2/3) ÷ 3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Write 3 as 3/1, then flip to get 1/3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Result: (2/3) × (1/3) = 2/9</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">reciprocal</strong> of a fraction:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Flip the numerator and denominator</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Reciprocal of 3/4 is 4/3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Reciprocal of 5 is 1/5 (since 5 = 5/1)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Reciprocal of x/(x-2) is (x-2)/x</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Why "keep, flip, change" works:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Dividing by a number is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 10 ÷ 2 = 10 × (1/2) = 5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Same principle applies to fractions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Simplifying Fractions (Critical Rules!)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Rule: You can ONLY simplify if you can divide ALL terms by the same number</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (2x+10)/4 CAN be simplified (divide all by 2) → (x+5)/2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (8x+3)/4 CANNOT be simplified (can''t divide 3 by 4)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Common mistake: (2x+10)/4 ≠ (x+10)/2 ❌ (You MUST divide ALL terms!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When you CANNOT simplify, split the fraction instead:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (8x+3)/4 = 8x/4 + 3/4 = 2x + 3/4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You CAN split numerators: (a+b)/c = a/c + b/c ✓</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You CANNOT split denominators: a/(b+c) ≠ a/b + a/c ❌</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Simplifying with variables in the denominator:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 3/(6x+30) CAN be simplified → 3/[3(2x+10)] → 1/(2x+10)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 3/(6x+10) CANNOT be simplified (can''t divide 10 by 3)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Same rule: ALL terms must be divisible by the same number</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">CRITICAL: You cannot split denominators!
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">3/(6x+10) ≠ 3/6x + 3/10 ❌ WRONG!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is one of the most common mistakes students make</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When in doubt, leave the denominator together</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Getting Rid of Fractions (Multiply by LCD)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For equations with only numbers in denominators, eliminate fractions:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Find the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">least common multiple</strong> (LCM) of all denominators</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Multiply EVERY term by the LCM</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">All fractions will disappear, leaving only whole numbers</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Then solve the equation normally</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: (1/4)x + (1/2) = (3/8)x
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">LCM of 4, 2, and 8 is 8</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Multiply all terms by 8: (1/4)x×8 + (1/2)×8 = (3/8)x×8</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Simplify: 2x + 4 = 3x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solve: x = 4</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">More complex example with subtraction:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (3x/5) - (2x/6) - (1/2) = (x/10)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">LCM of 5, 6, 2, and 10 is 30</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Multiply all terms by 30: 18x - 10x - 15 = 3x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Simplify: 8x - 15 = 3x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solve: 5x = 15, so x = 3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When to use this method:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you struggle with fractions, ALWAYS use this method!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It turns difficult fraction problems into easy whole number problems</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Works great when ALL denominators are numbers (not variables)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
5. Calculator Strategies for Fractions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Strategy #1: Turn fractions into decimals</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (3/4)x - (2/5) = (1/2)x becomes 0.75x - 0.4 = 0.5x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solve: 0.75x = 0.5x + 0.4 → 0.25x = 0.4 → x = 1.6</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Then convert 1.6 back to a fraction if needed, or check answer choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This avoids dealing with fractions entirely!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Strategy #2: Convert decimals to fractions using your calculator</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>TI-83/84:</strong> Enter decimal → Press MATH → Select "Frac" → Press ENTER</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>TI-30XS:</strong> Enter decimal → Press 2nd → Press PRB → Select F◂▸D → Press ENTER</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you have a different calculator, YouTube has tutorials for your model</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Strategy #3: Use parentheses properly!</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ALWAYS put the entire numerator in parentheses</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ALWAYS put the entire denominator in parentheses</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: To enter (2x+1)/(x-3), type: (2x+1)÷(x-3)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Without parentheses, calculator follows order of operations incorrectly</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Strategy #4: Compare answer choices as decimals</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you solved to get x = 1.6 (decimal)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">And answer choices are fractions like 8/5, 5/3, 13/10, etc.</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Enter each fraction in calculator to see which equals 1.6</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">8/5 = 1.6 ✓ That''s your answer!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Strategy #5: Backsolving</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the question asks "what is the value of x?" with answer choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Plug each answer choice back into the original equation</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use your calculator to check which one makes the equation true</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is often faster than solving algebraically!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
6. Test-Taking Tips for Fractions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Use your calculator strategically</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For numerical fractions: let calculator do the work</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For algebraic fractions: write out steps carefully</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Save mental energy for the hard problems</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Use substitution for "equivalent" questions</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If asked "which expression is equivalent," plug in a test value</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: If the original has x, try x = 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Calculate both expressions—they should give the same answer</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is often faster than algebraic manipulation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Remember the "cannot split denominators" rule</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">a/(b+c) ≠ a/b + a/c ❌ This is ALWAYS wrong!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">But (a+b)/c = a/c + b/c ✓ Splitting numerators is OK</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This mistake appears in wrong answer choices frequently</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>When in doubt, eliminate fractions</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If all denominators are numbers, multiply by LCM</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If dealing with fractions makes you nervous, turn them into decimals</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both methods turn hard problems into easy ones</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Master "Keep, Flip, Change" for division</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This simple rule handles ALL fraction division</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Keep first, flip second, change to multiplication</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Works every time, no exceptions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. What is Absolute Value? (Definition and Basic Operations)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Definition: Absolute value is the distance from zero on a number line</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Distance is always positive, so absolute value is always positive or zero</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">|3| = 3 (3 is three units from zero)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">|-3| = 3 (-3 is also three units from zero)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Order of Operations with Absolute Value:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Complete all math INSIDE the absolute value bars first</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Take the absolute value (make positive)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Complete remaining operations outside the bars</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Example: |3 - 7| + 2</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Work inside bars: |3 - 7| = |-4|</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Take absolute value: |-4| = 4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Complete outside: 4 + 2 = 6</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Calculator Tip:</strong> Most calculators have an "abs(" function for absolute value
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">On TI calculators: MATH → NUM → abs(</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You can use this to check your work quickly</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Solving Absolute Value Equations with Variables
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Key Concept: Absolute value equations with variables have TWO solutions</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Why? Because both a positive and negative number can have the same absolute value</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: |x - 3| = 5 means (x - 3) could equal 5 OR -5</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Four-Step Process to Solve:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Add/subtract any constants OUTSIDE the absolute value bars to move them to the other side</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Multiply/divide any coefficients directly IN FRONT of the absolute value bars</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Set the expression inside equal to BOTH the positive and negative value</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Solve both equations to get both solutions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Example: 3|2x + 1| - 6 = 45</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Add 6 to both sides → 3|2x + 1| = 51</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Divide by 3 → |2x + 1| = 17</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Set up two equations:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• 2x + 1 = 17 → 2x = 16 → x = 8</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• 2x + 1 = -17 → 2x = -18 → x = -9</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solution set: {-9, 8}</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Common Mistake:</strong> Only finding one solution
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ALWAYS check answer choices - if they show two values, you need both solutions!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you only find one solution, you probably forgot the negative case</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Absolute Value Inequalities (The Most Difficult Type)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Key Concept: Absolute value inequalities have INTERVAL solutions (not just two numbers)</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">|x| < 3 means "all numbers less than 3 units from zero"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solution: -3 < x < 3 (between -3 and 3)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Two Main Types:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Type 1: |x| < a or |x| ≤ a</strong> (Less than)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Solution format: -a < x < a (or -a ≤ x ≤ a)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• One compound inequality</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Think: "close to zero" or "between two values"</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>Type 2: |x| > a or |x| ≥ a</strong> (Greater than)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Solution format: x < -a AND x > a (or x ≤ -a AND x ≥ a)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Two separate inequalities with "AND"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Think: "far from zero" or "outside the interval"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Four-Step Process:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Isolate the absolute value bars (move all terms outside to the other side)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Determine the type (< means "between", > means "outside")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Set up the inequality based on type</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Solve for the variable</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Example 1: |x + 3| - 4 < 1</strong> (Less than type)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Add 4 to both sides → |x + 3| < 5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: This is "less than" type, so solution is between -5 and 5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Set up: -5 < x + 3 < 5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: Subtract 3 from all parts: -8 < x < 2</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Example 2: |½x + 2| > 3</strong> (Greater than type)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Already isolated</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: This is "greater than" type, so solution is outside -3 and 3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Set up two inequalities:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• ½x + 2 < -3 → ½x < -5 → x < -10</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• ½x + 2 > 3 → ½x > 1 → x > 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: Solution: x < -10 AND x > 2</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

4. Advanced Absolute Value Concepts
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Absolute Value Properties You Must Know:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>If |a| = -a, then a ≤ 0</strong> (a must be zero or negative)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Why? The only way absolute value equals its negative is if the number is ≤ 0</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>For x > 0 and y < 0: |x| - |y| = x - (-y) = x + y</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Positive number''s absolute value = itself</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Negative number''s absolute value = its opposite</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Comparing Absolute Values:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If a < b < c and c > 0:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• |c| is always the largest (furthest from zero on positive side)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Can''t determine which of |a| or |b| is larger without more info</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: If a = -10, b = -2, c = 5:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• |a| = 10, |b| = 2, |c| = 5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• |a| > |c| even though a < c</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Distance Interpretation:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>|x - a| = d</strong> means "x is d units away from a"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: |x + 2| = 8 means "x is 8 units from -2"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Note: x + 2 = x - (-2), so we''re measuring distance from -2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solutions: x = 6 or x = -10 (both are 8 units from -2)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Equivalent Expressions:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">|x - y - z| = |x - (y + z)|</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This also equals |-x + y + z| (opposite signs for all terms)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Absolute value of opposites are equal: |a| = |-a|</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Special Case: No Solution</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you end up with something like |-3x + 1| + 15 < 12:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Isolate: |-3x + 1| < -3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Absolute value can NEVER be negative, so NO SOLUTION!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
5. Test-Taking Tips for Absolute Value
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Tip #1: Look at answer choices first to determine what type of problem it is</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Two numbers in braces like {-9, 8}? → Absolute value equation (2 solutions)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Compound inequality like -8 < x < 2? → Absolute value inequality (interval)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Two inequalities with AND? → Greater than type inequality</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Tip #2: For equations, backsolve by plugging in answer choices</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the question asks for the solution to |2x - 4| = 10:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Try x = 7: |2(7) - 4| = |14 - 4| = |10| = 10 ✓</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is often faster than algebraic solving</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Tip #3: Remember the critical patterns</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">|x| < a → between two values (one compound inequality)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">|x| > a → outside two values (two separate inequalities with AND)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Memorize these patterns - they appear on EVERY ACT test!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Tip #4: Watch out for the "no solution" trap</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you isolate absolute value bars and get |something| < negative number → NO SOLUTION</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you isolate and get |something| = negative number → NO SOLUTION</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This often appears as answer choice "No solution" or "The empty set"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  <ul style="color: white; margin: 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.9; font-size: 0.98rem;">
    <li style="margin: 0.5rem 0;"><strong>Absolute value equations with variables ALWAYS have two solutions</strong> - set the inside equal to both positive and negative values</li>
    <li style="margin: 0.5rem 0;"><strong>For inequalities: |x| < a means -a < x < a (between), while |x| > a means x < -a AND x > a (outside)</strong></li>
    <li style="margin: 0.5rem 0;"><strong>Always isolate the absolute value bars first</strong> before setting up your equations or inequalities</li>
    <li style="margin: 0.5rem 0;"><strong>Remember: absolute value can never be negative</strong> - if you get |something| < 0, the answer is "no solution"</li>

1. Exponent Rules (Memorize These!)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The seven essential <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">exponent rules</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Product Rule: a^x × a^y = a^(x+y)</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 3³ × 3⁴ = 3⁷</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When multiplying with the same base, add the exponents</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Quotient Rule: a^x ÷ a^y = a^(x-y)</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 5⁷ ÷ 5² = 5⁵</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When dividing with the same base, subtract the exponents</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Power Rule: (a^x)^y = a^(xy)</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (2³)² = 2⁶</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When raising a power to a power, multiply the exponents</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">CRITICAL: Distribute to ALL terms, including coefficients!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (-2xy³)² = 4x²y⁶ (the -2 becomes 4!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Negative Exponent Rule: a^(-x) = 1/a^x</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 2^(-3) = 1/2³ = 1/8</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Negative exponents mean "reciprocal"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Trick: Moving a term from numerator to denominator (or vice versa) flips the sign of the exponent</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: x^(-2)/y^(-3) = y³/x²</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Zero Power Rule: a^0 = 1</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 139⁰ = 1</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ANY number to the zero power equals 1 (except 0⁰ which is undefined)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>One Power Rule: a^1 = a</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (-4)¹ = -4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Any number to the first power is itself</li>

  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Fraction Power Rule</strong>: a^(x/y) = ʸ√(a^x)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 8^(2/3) = ³√(8²) = ³√64 = 4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Or: 8^(2/3) = (³√8)² = 2² = 4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The denominator is the root, the numerator is the power</li>
    </ul>

2. Solving Exponential Equations
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When bases are the same, set exponents equal:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If 4^(3x+1) = 4^(-x+7), then 3x+1 = -x+7</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solve: 4x = 6, so x = 3/2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This works because equal exponential expressions with the same base must have equal exponents</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When bases are different, make them the same:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 9^(2x) = 27^(x+4)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Recognize that 9 = 3² and 27 = 3³</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Rewrite: (3²)^(2x) = (3³)^(x+4)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Simplify: 3^(4x) = 3^(3x+12)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Set exponents equal: 4x = 3x+12, so x = 12</li>

3. Simplifying Radicals
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">To simplify a square root, factor and take out pairs:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: √50 = √(5×5×2) = 5√2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">There''s a pair of 5''s, so take the 5 out front</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The 2 is not part of a pair, so it stays under the radical</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">More complex example:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">√108 = √(2×2×3×3×3) = (2×3)√3 = 6√3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">We have a pair of 2''s and a pair of 3''s, so take both out</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The third 3 is not part of a pair, so it stays under the radical</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Going backwards - putting numbers back under the radical:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Take the number outside and square it under the radical</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 6√3 = √(6×6×3) = √108</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is useful when you need to combine radicals</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Combining radicals (only like radicals can be combined):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: √45 + √20 = 3√5 + 2√5 = 5√5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">First simplify each radical: √45 = √(3×3×5) = 3√5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">And: √20 = √(2×2×5) = 2√5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Then combine like radicals by adding coefficients</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Operations with Radicals
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Multiplying and dividing radicals:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>√x × √y = √(xy)</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: √8 × √2 = √16 = 4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>√x ÷ √y = √(x/y)</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: √50 ÷ √2 = √(50/2) = √25 = 5</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Solving radical equations:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: If √(2x) = 5√6, solve for x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Method #1: Move the 5 under the radical: √(2x) = √(6×5×5) = √150</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Since the radicals are equal, the contents must be equal: 2x = 150, so x = 75</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Alternate method - square both sides:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">(√(2x))² = (5√6)²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">2x = 25 × 6</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">2x = 150, so x = 75</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Cube roots and higher roots follow the same rules:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">³√(xy) = ³√x × ³√y</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: ³√16 = ³√(8×2) = ³√8 × ³√2 = 2³√2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For cube roots, take out groups of three instead of pairs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
5. Test-Taking Tips for Exponents and Roots
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Memorize all seven exponent rules COLD</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You cannot skip any of them—all appear on the ACT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Practice until you can apply them instantly without thinking</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The product, quotient, and power rules are tested most often</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>When distributing powers, distribute to EVERYTHING</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t forget coefficients! (-2x)³ = -8x³, not -2x³</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t forget ALL variables! (3xy²)² = 9x²y⁴, not 9xy⁴</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is the #1 mistake students make with exponents</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Use your calculator to backsolve when possible</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the question gives answer choices, plugging in is often faster</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Calculate both sides of the equation with each answer</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This works great for exponential equations and radical equations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>For radicals, factor methodically</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Break numbers down into prime factors to find all pairs</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 72 = 2×2×2×3×3 → pairs of 2''s and 3''s → 6√2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t rush—missing a pair means getting the wrong answer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Look for common bases in exponential equations</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Recognize that 4 = 2², 8 = 2³, 16 = 2⁴</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Recognize that 9 = 3², 27 = 3³, 81 = 3⁴</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Converting to the same base makes equations much easier to solve</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Only need to check up to √n</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Is 97 prime? Check 2, 3, 5, 7 (√97 ≈ 9.8)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">None divide evenly → 97 is prime</li>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When 17 is divided by 5, the remainder is 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Because 17 = 5(3) + 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">On calculator: 17 ÷ 5 = 3.4 → take 3 → 5(3) = 15 → 17 - 15 = 2</li>

2. Parallel Lines and Angle Relationships
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When two <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">parallel lines</strong> are crossed by another line (called a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">transversal</strong>), special angle relationships are created</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The most important rule to remember:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">There are <strong>two sets of identical angles</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Any angle from the first set is <strong>supplementary</strong> to any angle from the second set</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: If one angle is 60°, four angles will be 60° and four angles will be 120°</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Specific angle relationships you should know:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Vertical angles</strong> are equal</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Alternate interior angles</strong> are equal (angles on opposite sides of the transversal, between the parallel lines)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Corresponding angles</strong> are equal (angles in the same position at each intersection)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Opposite interior angles</strong> are supplementary (they add to 180°)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>TIP:</strong> Extend parallel lines with your pencil
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sometimes parallel lines in diagrams don''t extend all the way across</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Draw them longer yourself to make angle relationships easier to see</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: In a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">parallelogram</strong>, extend the sides to create full parallel lines</li>

3. Interior Angles in Polygons
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Every <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">polygon</strong> has a specific sum of interior angles based on the number of sides
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Triangle</strong> (3 sides): 180°</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Quadrilateral</strong> (4 sides): 360°</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Pentagon</strong> (5 sides): 540°</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Hexagon</strong> (6 sides): 720°</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The formula for any polygon:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Sum of Interior Angles = 180°(n − 2)</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Where <em>n</em> is the number of sides</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This formula works for <strong>any polygon</strong>, regardless of shape</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">How to use this formula on the ACT:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Count the number of sides of the polygon</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Plug n into the formula: 180°(n − 2)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Set the sum equal to the given angles and solve</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The shape doesn''t matter—only the number of sides matters</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Common polygon applications:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">

4. Test-Taking Tips for Angle Questions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Always label angles as you find them</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Write angle measurements directly on the diagram</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The more angles you label, the easier it becomes to find the angle you need</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use vertical angle and supplementary angle relationships to fill in values</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Look for triangles within the figure</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">All angles in a triangle add to 180°</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you know two angles in a triangle, you can find the third</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sometimes you need to find angles in one triangle to solve another triangle</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Watch for <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">angle bisectors</strong></strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">An <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">angle bisector</strong> cuts an angle exactly in half</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If an angle is 72° and it''s bisected, each half is 36°</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use this to find additional angles in the figure</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Use what you know about parallel lines</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you see two parallel lines, look for the transversal</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Identify which angles are equal and which are supplementary</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Remember: there are two groups of identical angles</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

1. Simple Percentages
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Two methods for solving percentage problems:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Method 1: Proportion</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">new/original = %/100</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Original" is the starting value (100%)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"New" is the percentage of the starting value</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Method 2: Decimal shortcut (FASTER)</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Convert percentage to decimal by dividing by 100</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">72% = 0.72, 120% = 1.2, 8.5% = 0.085</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Multiply: new = original × decimal</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is faster and less error-prone!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Isaiah bought a watch for 72% of the original $160 price. How much did he pay?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Method 1 (Proportion): x/160 = 72/100 → x = $115.20</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Method 2 (Decimal): 0.72 × 160 = $115.20</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both give same answer, but decimal method is faster!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Finding the original when given the percentage:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Golf clubs cost $720 at 80% of original price. Find original price.</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Set up: 720 = 0.80 × original</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solve: original = 720 ÷ 0.80 = $900</li>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Percent Increase = (New - Original) ÷ Original × 100</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Find the difference, divide by original, multiply by 100</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">CRITICAL: Always divide by the ORIGINAL (starting) value</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Population increases from 500,000 to 620,000. Find percent increase.
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Find the change</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Change = 620,000 - 500,000 = 120,000</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Divide by original</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">120,000 ÷ 500,000 = 0.24</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Convert to percentage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">0.24 × 100 = 24% increase</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Shortcut for calculating new value after percent increase:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For a 20% increase: multiply by 1.20 (not 0.20!)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For a 35% increase: multiply by 1.35</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For a 150% increase: multiply by 2.50</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Formula: New = Original × (1 + percent/100)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Percent Decrease
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">percent decrease</strong> formula:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Percent Decrease = (Original - New) ÷ Original × 100</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Find the difference, divide by original, multiply by 100</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Same process as percent increase, just subtract in reverse</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Price decreases from $80 to $68. Find percent decrease.
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Find the change</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Change = 80 - 68 = 12</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Divide by original</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">12 ÷ 80 = 0.15</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Convert to percentage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">0.15 × 100 = 15% decrease</li>

4. Multiple Percentage Changes
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">CRITICAL: Percentage changes are multiplicative, NOT additive
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A 20% increase followed by a 20% decrease does NOT return to original!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Each percentage change applies to the NEW value, not the original</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Must calculate step-by-step</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Price starts at $100, increases 20%, then decreases 20%. What''s the final price?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Apply 20% increase</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">$100 × 1.20 = $120</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Apply 20% decrease to NEW value</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">$120 × 0.80 = $96</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Final price is $96, NOT $100!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Shortcut for multiple changes:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Multiply all the multipliers together</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">20% increase then 20% decrease: 1.20 × 0.80 = 0.96</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Final = Original × 0.96 = $100 × 0.96 = $96</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Successive increases:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 10% increase, then another 10% increase</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Total: 1.10 × 1.10 = 1.21 (a 21% increase, not 20%!)</li>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">30% off means pay 70% (multiply by 0.70)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sale price = Original × (1 - discount rate)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">To find original from sale: Original = Sale ÷ (1 - discount rate)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Tips and taxes:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">15% tip on $50 meal: $50 × 0.15 = $7.50 tip</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Total with tip: $50 × 1.15 = $57.50</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sales tax works the same way</li>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">20% of 30% of 500 = 0.20 × 0.30 × 500 = 30</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Multiply all the decimals together</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">What percent is X of Y?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Formula: (X ÷ Y) × 100</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: What percent is 15 of 60?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">(15 ÷ 60) × 100 = 0.25 × 100 = 25%</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Common mistake to avoid:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When finding percent change, ALWAYS divide by the ORIGINAL value</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Wrong: dividing by the new value</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Right: (change) ÷ (original) × 100</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

1. Understanding Ratios
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">What ratios represent:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Ratios compare quantities using division</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Written as a:b or a/b or "a to b"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: If ratio of oranges to apples is 2:3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This means for every 2 oranges, there are 3 apples</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">CRITICAL: The "x trick" for ratios
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If ratio is a:b, think of it as ax:bx</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both parts must be multiplied by the same value</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Ratio 4:6 means 4x red marbles and 6x green marbles</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This trick is essential for solving ratio problems!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Simplifying ratios:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Divide both parts by their GCF</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 12:18 = 2:3 (divide both by 6)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 25:100 = 1:4 (divide both by 25)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Ratio Problems with Totals
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When given a ratio and a total:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use the "x trick" to set up an equation</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Add the ratio parts to equal the total</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solve for x, then find what the question asks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Red to green marbles is 4:6. Total is 80. How many red?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Use x trick</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Red = 4x, Green = 6x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Set up equation with total</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">4x + 6x = 80</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Solve for x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">10x = 80 → x = 8</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: Find red marbles</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Red = 4x = 4(8) = 32 marbles</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Alternative method: Use fractions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Red marbles = (4/(4+6)) × 80 = (4/10) × 80 = 32</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Denominator = sum of ratio parts</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">a/b = c/d</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">To solve, cross multiply: a × d = b × c</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Then solve for the unknown variable</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: If 3/5 = x/20, find x
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Cross multiply</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">3 × 20 = 5 × x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Simplify</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">60 = 5x</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">x = 12</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Direct proportion word problems:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If 5 apples cost $3, how much do 8 apples cost?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Set up proportion: 5/3 = 8/x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cross multiply: 5x = 24</li>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Unit rate = quantity ÷ units</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 120 miles in 2 hours</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Rate = 120 ÷ 2 = 60 miles per hour</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use rate to find distance: distance = rate × time</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Scale problems:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Map scale: 1 inch = 50 miles</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If distance on map is 3.5 inches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Actual distance = 3.5 × 50 = 175 miles</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Set up as proportion: 1/50 = 3.5/x</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Similar figures and scale factors:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If two triangles are similar with scale factor 1:3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">All corresponding sides are in ratio 1:3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If small triangle side = 4, large triangle side = 12</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Areas scale by the square: 1²:3² = 1:9</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Part-to-part: red:green = 2:3 (comparing two parts)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Part-to-whole: red:total = 2:5 (one part to everything)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If red:green = 2:3, then red:total = 2:(2+3) = 2:5</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Inverse proportion:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When one quantity increases, the other decreases</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: More workers → less time needed</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If 6 workers take 8 hours, how long for 12 workers?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">6 × 8 = 12 × x → 48 = 12x → x = 4 hours</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">10 feet × (12 inches / 1 foot) = 120 inches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The "feet" units cancel, leaving inches</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Mixed units (feet and inches):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 10 feet 3 inches = ?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Convert feet to inches: 10 × 12 = 120 inches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Add the extra inches: 120 + 3 = 123 inches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: To convert back: 123 ÷ 12 = 10 remainder 3 → 10 feet 3 inches</li>

2. Area and Volume Unit Conversions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">CRITICAL rule for area/volume conversions:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Convert the units BEFORE calculating area or volume</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Never calculate area/volume first and then try to convert</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is a common trap on the ACT!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Tennis court is 78 feet long and 36 feet wide. Find area in square yards.
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">WRONG: Calculate 78 × 36 = 2,808 square feet, then convert</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">RIGHT: Convert dimensions first</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Length: 78 feet × (1 yard / 3 feet) = 26 yards</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Width: 36 feet × (1 yard / 3 feet) = 12 yards</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Area: 26 × 12 = 312 square yards</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Pay attention to bolded units:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When the ACT bolds units in the question, it''s a warning</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Double-check you''re solving for the correct units</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This prevents accidentally giving an answer in wrong units</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Dimensional Analysis (Advanced Conversions)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Dimensional analysis</strong> uses conversion factors to convert between units:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Start with the given value</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Multiply by conversion factors to switch units</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Set up fractions so units cancel correctly</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: Multiply and divide to get final answer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Convert 30 meters per second to kilometers per hour (1 km = 1,000 m)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Set up as fraction: 30 m / 1 s</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Convert meters to kilometers: (30 m / 1 s) × (1 km / 1,000 m) = 30 km / 1,000 s</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Convert seconds to minutes: (30 km / 1,000 s) × (60 s / 1 min) = 1,800 km / 1,000 min</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Convert minutes to hours: (1,800 km / 1,000 min) × (60 min / 1 hr) = 108,000 km / 1,000 hr</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Simplify: 108,000 ÷ 1,000 = 108 km/hr</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">One-step method (all at once):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">(30 m / 1 s) × (1 km / 1,000 m) × (60 s / 1 min) × (60 min / 1 hr)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">= (30 × 1 × 60 × 60) / (1 × 1,000 × 1 × 1) = 108,000 / 1,000 = 108 km/hr</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">All units except km and hr cancel out</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Key principle:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If units cancel correctly, your setup is right!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Unwanted units should appear once in numerator and once in denominator</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Desired units should remain after cancellation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

4. Rate Problems with Unit Conversion
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Distance = Speed × Time (must have matching units):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If speed is in miles per hour, time must be in hours</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If speed is in miles per minute, time must be in minutes</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Convert one or both to make units match</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Erica bikes 24 mph for 40 minutes. How far does she travel?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Problem: Speed is per hour, time is in minutes (units don''t match!)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solution: Convert speed to miles per minute</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">24 miles/hr × (1 hr / 60 min) = 0.4 miles/min</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Distance = 0.4 miles/min × 40 min = 16 miles</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Time = Distance ÷ Speed:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: How long to travel 16 miles at 18 mph?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Convert speed: 18 mph × (1 hr / 60 min) = 0.3 miles/min</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Time = 16 miles ÷ 0.3 miles/min = 53.3 minutes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Volume conversions (gallons to quarts):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Two 50-gallon bags, using 3 quarts per loaf (1 gallon = 4 quarts)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Total flour: 2 × 50 = 100 gallons</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Convert: 100 gallons × (4 quarts / 1 gallon) = 400 quarts</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Loaves: 400 quarts ÷ 3 quarts/loaf = 133.3 loaves</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

5. Algebraic Unit Conversion
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When variables are involved:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Same process as numeric conversions</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use conversion factors with variables</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Simplify algebraically</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: A pipe p feet long is cut into n pieces. Each piece is x inches. Find x.
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Convert feet to inches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">p feet × (12 inches / 1 foot) = 12p inches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Divide by number of pieces</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">x = 12p / n inches per piece</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Alternative: Substitution method
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pick easy numbers: Let p = 2 feet, n = 3 pieces</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Convert: 2 feet × 12 = 24 inches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Divide: 24 ÷ 3 = 8 inches per piece, so x = 8</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Plug p = 2, n = 3, x = 8 into answer choices to find which works</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is faster when algebra seems complicated!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Common algebraic conversions:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">f feet = 12f inches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">y yards = 3y feet = 36y inches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">h hours = 60h minutes = 3,600h seconds</li>
    </ul>

1. Scientific Notation Basics
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Format of <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">scientific notation</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Always written as: (digit term) × 10^(power)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 15,000,000 = 1.5 × 10^7</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Digit term: 1.5 (must be ≥ 1 and < 10)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Exponential term: 10^7 (base is always 10)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">CRITICAL requirement for digit term:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Digit term must be: 1 ≤ digit term < 10</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 2.5 × 10^4 is CORRECT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 25 × 10^3 is WRONG (digit term too large)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 0.25 × 10^5 is WRONG (digit term too small)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Why use scientific notation:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Makes very large numbers easier to read and write</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Makes very small numbers easier to express</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Common in science for astronomical or microscopic values</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

2. Converting Large Numbers to Scientific Notation
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Process for numbers greater than 10:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Place decimal after the first non-zero digit</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Count how many places the decimal moved LEFT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: That count is the POSITIVE exponent</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Convert 15,000,000 to scientific notation
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Original: 15,000,000. (decimal at end)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Move decimal between 1 and 5: 1.5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Count moves: 7 places to the LEFT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Result: 1.5 × 10^7</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">More examples:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">201,000 → decimal moves 5 left → 2.01 × 10^5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">8,320 → decimal moves 3 left → 8.32 × 10^3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">250,000 → decimal moves 5 left → 2.5 × 10^5</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Rule to remember:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Moving decimal LEFT → POSITIVE exponent</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Large numbers → positive powers of 10</li>
    </ul>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: That count is the NEGATIVE exponent</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Convert 0.000916 to scientific notation
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Original: 0.000916</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Move decimal after the 9: 9.16</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Count moves: 4 places to the RIGHT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Result: 9.16 × 10^(-4)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">More examples:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">0.0000005 → decimal moves 7 right → 5 × 10^(-7)</li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Rule to remember:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Moving decimal RIGHT → NEGATIVE exponent</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Small numbers (< 1) → negative powers of 10</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Digit term still must be between 1 and 10</li>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Only possible when exponents are the SAME</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Add or subtract digit terms, keep exponent</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (3.5 × 10^6) + (2.1 × 10^6) = 5.6 × 10^6</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use the pattern to determine the value</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pick a specific value that matches the condition</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Count forward or backward in the pattern</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: 3^x has a 9 in the ones place. What digit does 3^(x+3) have?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pattern for powers of 3: 3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, 7, 1...</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If 3^x ends in 9, then x could be 2, 6, 10, 14, etc.</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pick x = 2 (since 3^2 = 9)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Then 3^(x+3) = 3^5 = 243</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Units digit is 3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">OR: Starting from 9, count 3 forward: 9 → 7 → 1 → 3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Key insight:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Any value of x that gives the same units digit works</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Counting forward/backward in pattern gives consistent result</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pick the simplest value to make calculations easier</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pattern repeats every 4 terms</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Every 4th power equals 1 (i^4, i^8, i^12, ...)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Find multiple of 4 near 47: closest is 44 or 48</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Using 48: i^48 = 1</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Count backward: i^47 = -i</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Substitute: 10(-i) - 7 = -10i - 7</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: If k is a multiple of 4, find i^(4k+1)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pick k = 4 (any multiple of 4 works)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">i^(4k+1) = i^(4·4+1) = i^17</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Find multiple of 4 near 17: i^16 = 1</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Count forward: i^17 = i</li>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step-by-step process:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Identify the repeating unit and its length</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Go to the END of the repeating unit</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Find the nearest multiple of the pattern length</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: Count forward or backward to find the target term</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example workflow for 0.235638̄, finding 103rd digit:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Repeating unit is 235638 (6 digits)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: End of unit is "8"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Multiple of 6 near 103 is 102</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: 102nd digit = 8, so 103rd digit = 2</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Tips for success:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For repeating decimals: count the digits under the bar</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For powers: most patterns repeat every 4 terms</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For powers of i: pattern is always every 4 terms</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If pattern isn''t memorized, write out first several terms</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use division to find nearest multiple quickly</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Other applications:

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. Basic Definitions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Four statistical measures you must know:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Mean (average):</strong> The sum divided by the number of items</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Median:</strong> The middle number when ordered from smallest to largest</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Mode:</strong> The number that appears most often</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Range:</strong> The difference between the largest and smallest numbers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The fundamental average formula:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Average = Sum ÷ Number of Items</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Rearrange to: <strong>Sum = Average × Number of Items</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This rearranged form is crucial for many ACT questions!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Memorize both forms</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Find the mean of {2, 5, 8, 9}
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sum = 2 + 5 + 8 + 9 = 24</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Number of items = 4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Mean = 24 ÷ 4 = 6</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Finding Missing Values Using Mean
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The most common ACT question type:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You''re given the average and most values</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Asked to find a missing value</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use algebra to solve</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Five students averaged 24 points. Four scored 22, 28, 17, and 25. Find the fifth score.
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Set up the equation</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Let x = fifth student''s score</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">24 = (22 + 28 + 17 + 25 + x) ÷ 5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Simplify</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">24 = (92 + x) ÷ 5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Multiply both sides by 5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">120 = 92 + x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: Solve for x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">x = 28</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">CRITICAL shortcut:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Always multiply average by number of items first</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This gives you the total sum immediately</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Makes solving much easier!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">In example above: 24 × 5 = 120 (total sum)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Combining Averages
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">CRITICAL: You CANNOT just average the averages!
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When combining groups with different sizes</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Must find total sum for ALL items</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Then divide by total number of items</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Period 1 has 6 students averaging 85. Period 2 has 9 students averaging 90. Find combined average.
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Find total points for Period 1</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sum = Average × Number</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sum₁ = 85 × 6 = 510 points</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Find total points for Period 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sum₂ = 90 × 9 = 810 points</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Calculate combined average</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Combined Average = (510 + 810) ÷ (6 + 9)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Combined Average = 1320 ÷ 15 = 88</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Common mistake to avoid:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">WRONG: (85 + 90) ÷ 2 = 87.5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This ignores that groups have different sizes</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Period 2 has MORE students, so its average should count more</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Always convert to total sums first!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Working with Median
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">median</strong> is positional:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Depends on WHERE values fall in ordered list</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">NOT the numerical values themselves</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ALWAYS order the data first!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Finding median with odd number of values:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: {4, 1, 9, 3, 7}</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Order: {1, 3, 4, 7, 9}</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Pick middle value: 4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Median = 4</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Finding median with even number of values:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: {2, 8, 5, 9, 3, 6}</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Order: {2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9}</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Find two middle values: 5 and 6</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Average them: (5 + 6) ÷ 2 = 5.5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Median = 5.5</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Finding missing value when median is given:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Median of {3, 7, x, 12} is 8. Find x.</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: With 4 values, median = average of 2nd and 3rd</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Order known values: {3, ?, ?, 12}</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Test where x fits</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If x ≥ 7, order is {3, 7, x, 12}</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Median = (7 + x) ÷ 2 = 8</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">7 + x = 16 → x = 9 ✓</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

5. Mode and Range
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Finding the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">mode</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Count how many times each value appears</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Mode = value(s) with highest frequency</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: {3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 9} → Mode = 7 (appears 3 times)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Can have multiple modes if values tie for most frequent</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">No mode if all values appear equally</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Finding the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">range</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Range = Maximum - Minimum</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: {12, 4, 18, 7, 9}</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Max = 18, Min = 4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Range = 18 - 4 = 14</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">How adding values affects statistics:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Adding value equal to current mean → mean stays same</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Adding value larger than max → range increases</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Adding value smaller than min → range increases</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Adding value between min and max → range stays same</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Probability measures the likelihood of an event occurring. The ACT tests basic probability calculations, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">independent events</strong>, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">dependent events</strong> (with and without replacement).
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. Basic Probability Formula
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The fundamental probability formula:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Probability = Desired Outcomes ÷ Total Possible Outcomes</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Always expressed as a fraction, decimal, or percentage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Probability values range from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: A bag contains 38 candies: 18 blue, 10 red, 5 yellow, 3 green, 2 pink
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">What is the probability of selecting a yellow candy?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Desired outcomes = 5 (yellow candies)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Total outcomes = 38 (total candies)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Probability = 5/38</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Finding probability of NOT selecting something:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Count everything that ISN''T the unwanted outcome</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Probability of NOT selecting blue candy</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Blue candies = 18, so NOT blue = 38 - 18 = 20</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Probability = 20/38 = 10/19</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Multiple Events (AND Rule)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">CRITICAL: When events happen in sequence, MULTIPLY their probabilities
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The word "and" means multiply</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Common mistake:</strong> Adding probabilities instead of multiplying</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Select a red candy AND THEN a green candy
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">First selection: P(red) = 10/38</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Second selection: P(green) = 3/37 (only 37 left after first pick)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">P(red AND green) = (10/38) × (3/37) = 30/1406 = 15/703</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Without replacement vs. with replacement:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Without replacement:</strong> Total decreases after each selection</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">After picking first candy, only 37 remain (as shown above)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">With replacement:</strong> Total stays the same (item returned)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If candy is replaced: P(red AND green) = (10/38) × (3/38)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Multiple Possibilities (OR Rule)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When you want probability of one event OR another event:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The word "or" means add</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This applies when events are mutually exclusive (can''t both happen)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Probability of selecting red OR yellow candy
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">P(red) = 10/38</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">P(yellow) = 5/38</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">P(red OR yellow) = 10/38 + 5/38 = 15/38</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Quick method when events don''t overlap:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Count total desired outcomes directly</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Red or yellow = 10 + 5 = 15 candies total</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Probability = 15/38 (same result, faster!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Probability with Geometric Scenarios
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Some ACT probability questions use area or length:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Probability = Desired Area ÷ Total Area</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Or: Probability = Desired Length ÷ Total Length</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Same concept as basic probability, just with geometric measurements</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Dartboard with target circle inside square board
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Square board: 10 inches × 10 inches = 100 square inches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Target circle: radius 3 inches, area = π(3)² = 9π square inches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Probability of hitting target = 9π/100</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Random point on a line segment
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Line segment from 0 to 20</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">What''s probability the point is between 5 and 12?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Desired length = 12 - 5 = 7</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Total length = 20</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Probability = 7/20</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
5. Common Probability Scenarios on the ACT

2. Fundamental Counting Principle
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">fundamental counting principle</strong>: If one event can occur in m ways and another can occur in n ways, then both can occur in m × n ways
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Multiply the number of choices for each decision</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is the MOST common counting method on the ACT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Works when order matters AND when order doesn''t matter (for independent choices)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Creating outfits
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You have 3 shirts, 4 pairs of shoes, and 5 pairs of pants</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">How many different outfits can you create?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Total outfits = 3 × 4 × 5 = 60</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Lock codes
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A lock code has 3 numbers (0-9) and 2 letters (A-Z)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">How many different codes are possible?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Numbers: 10 choices for each digit = 10 × 10 × 10 = 1,000</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Letters: 26 choices for each letter = 26 × 26 = 676</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Total codes = 1,000 × 676 = 676,000</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When choices decrease (without replacement):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Selecting 3 people from a group of 10 for 1st, 2nd, 3rd place</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">1st place: 10 choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">2nd place: 9 choices (one person already selected)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">3rd place: 8 choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Total arrangements = 10 × 9 × 8 = 720</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Permutations (Order Matters)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Permutations</strong> count arrangements where ORDER MATTERS:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Different orderings count as different outcomes</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: ABC is different from BAC</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Used for rankings, positions, seating arrangements</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The permutation formula:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>nPr = n!/(n-r)!</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">n = total number of items</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">r = number of items being selected</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">nPr = number of ways to arrange r items from n items</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: How many ways can you arrange 3 books from a shelf of 5 books?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">n = 5 books total, r = 3 books selected</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">5P3 = 5!/(5-3)! = 5!/2!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">5P3 = (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)/(2 × 1)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">5P3 = 120/2 = 60 arrangements</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Shortcut using fundamental counting principle:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Same problem: 5 books, select 3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">1st position: 5 choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">2nd position: 4 choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">3rd position: 3 choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Total = 5 × 4 × 3 = 60 (same answer, faster!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Combinations (Order Doesn''t Matter)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Combinations</strong> count selections where ORDER DOESN''T MATTER:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Different orderings count as the SAME outcome</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: ABC is the same as BAC is the same as CAB</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Used for groups, committees, selections</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The combination formula:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>nCr = n!/(r!(n-r)!)</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">n = total number of items</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">r = number of items being selected</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">nCr = number of ways to select r items from n items</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: How many ways can you select 3 books from a shelf of 5 books?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">n = 5 books, r = 3 books (order doesn''t matter)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">5C3 = 5!/(3! × 2!)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">5C3 = (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)/((3 × 2 × 1) × (2 × 1))</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">5C3 = 120/(6 × 2) = 120/12 = 10</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Key difference from permutations:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Same problem with permutations gave 60 arrangements</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">With combinations, we get 10 selections</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Combinations are ALWAYS smaller (or equal) to permutations</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">We divide by r! to remove duplicate orderings</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
5. When to Use Each Method
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Use <strong>Fundamental Counting Principle</strong> when:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Making multiple independent choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Creating combinations of items (outfits, meals, codes)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is the FASTEST method—use it whenever possible!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Use <strong>Permutations</strong> when:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ORDER MATTERS in the selection</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Words: "arrange," "order," "rank," "position"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Examples: Race finish order, seating arrangements, passwords</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Use <strong>Combinations</strong> when:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ORDER DOESN''T MATTER in the selection</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Words: "group," "committee," "team," "select," "choose"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Examples: Choosing committee members, selecting toppings, forming groups</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Quick decision tree:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Question asks "how many outfits/meals/codes?" → Fundamental Counting Principle (multiply choices)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Question asks "arrange" or "order" → Permutation (order matters)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Question asks "select" or "choose a group" → Combination (order doesn''t matter)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Common ACT trick:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The ACT will often make permutation and combination both answer choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read carefully: does order matter?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you select people for a "committee," order doesn''t matter (combination)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you select people for "president, VP, secretary," order matters (permutation)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Many calculators have a "!" button that can solve factorials for you</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look it up online to see if your calculator has this feature</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Advanced factorial definition:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For a positive integer n: n! = n(n - 1)(n - 2)...(2)(1)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is the same rule written in mathematical notation</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Understanding this is important for advanced factorial questions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Advanced factorial simplification:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When factorials are in fractions, you can cancel common terms</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (3!)(n!) / (n+1)!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Expand: (3!)(n)(n-1)...(1) / [(n+1)(n)(n-1)...(1)]</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cancel the n! parts, leaving: 3! / (n+1) = 6 / (n+1)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Tip: Use substitution! Pick n = 2, calculate the numerical answer, then test answer choices</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

2. Permutations (Order Matters)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">In <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">permutations</strong>, the order matters
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the order in which objects are selected makes the outcome different, use a permutation</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Selecting president, vice president, and party planner from 15 students</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Alice as president ≠ Bob as president (different outcomes!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Permutation formula:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">nPr = n! / (n - r)!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">n = number of items to choose from</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">r = number of items we actually choose</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Most calculators have nPr programmed in, so you likely don''t need to memorize this formula</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: 15 students selecting 3 for president, VP, and party planner
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Order matters (president ≠ VP ≠ party planner)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">n = 15 (choosing from 15 students)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">r = 3 (choosing 3 students)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">15P3 = 15! / (15 - 3)! = 15! / 12! = 2,730</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When to use permutations:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Assigning people to different roles or positions</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Arranging objects in a specific order</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Any situation where changing the order changes the outcome</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Combinations (Order Doesn''t Matter)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">In <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">combinations</strong>, the order does NOT matter
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the order you select objects does not affect the final outcome, use a combination</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Andrew inviting 4 friends to a baseball game from 12 friends</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Inviting {Alice, Bob, Carol, Dan} = same as inviting {Dan, Alice, Carol, Bob}</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Combination formula:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">nCr = n! / [r!(n - r)!]</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">n = number of items to choose from</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">r = number of items we actually choose</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Most calculators have nCr programmed in</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Andrew has 12 friends, invites 4 to baseball game
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Order doesn''t matter (same group, different invite order = same outcome)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">n = 12 (choosing from 12 friends)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">r = 4 (choosing 4 friends)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">12C4 = 12! / [4!(12 - 4)!] = 12! / (4! × 8!) = 495</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When to use combinations:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Selecting a group of people (no specific roles)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Choosing items where order doesn''t matter</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Counting pairs or groups</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Key difference from permutations:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Permutations have MORE outcomes (order matters)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Combinations have FEWER outcomes (order doesn''t matter)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Notice: nCr formula has an extra r! in denominator</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

4. Organized Counting (Most Common!)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Most "how many" questions on the ACT use <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">organized counting</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is simpler than permutations and combinations!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Answer "how many choices do I have?" for each position</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Then multiply all the choices together</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The organized counting method:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Draw a diagram with positions for each item</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Fill in the number of choices for each position</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Multiply all the numbers together</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Eric''s outfit with 6 shirts, 5 pants, 7 ties, 3 shoes
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Draw: Shirt × Pants × Tie × Shoes = Total</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Fill in: 6 × 5 × 7 × 3 = Total</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Calculate: 6 × 5 × 7 × 3 = 630 different outfits</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: 7-character code with 2 letters then 5 numbers (can repeat)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Draw: Letter × Letter × Number × Number × Number × Number × Number = Total</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">First letter: 26 choices (A-Z)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Second letter: 26 choices (letters can repeat!)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Each number: 10 choices (0-9, numbers can repeat!)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Fill in: 26 × 26 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Simplify: 26² × 10⁵ = 67,600,000 codes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: 6-character safe code with restrictions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Rules: First and last are DIFFERENT letters, 2nd must be 0 or 1, middle spots are any numbers (can repeat)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Draw: Letter × (0 or 1) × Number × Number × Number × Letter = Total</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">First letter: 26 choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Second position: 2 choices (0 or 1)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Middle numbers: 10 choices each (can repeat)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Last letter: 25 choices (must be different from first!)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Fill in: 26 × 2 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 25</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Calculate: 1,300,000 combinations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Key tips for organized counting:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ALWAYS draw the diagram—don''t try to do it mentally</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pay attention to "can repeat" vs "must be different"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If items can repeat, use the same number for each position</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If items must be different, reduce the count for each subsequent position</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Method 1 - Combinations:</strong> How many pairs from 6 people?
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">6C2 = 6! / (2! × 4!) = 15 high fives</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Order doesn''t matter (A high-fiving B = B high-fiving A)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Method 2 - Organized Counting:</strong> Count systematically
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Player A high fives 5 others = 5</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Player B high fives 4 remaining (already did A) = 4</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Player C high fives 3 remaining = 3</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Player D high fives 2 remaining = 2</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Player E high fives 1 remaining (coach) = 1</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Total: 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Choosing which method to use:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you''re comfortable with combinations: use nCr</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you prefer step-by-step logic: use organized counting</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both methods work—use whichever makes more sense to you!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Advanced counting appears in last 15 questions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These problems combine multiple concepts</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">May involve restrictions, special conditions, or multiple cases</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Draw diagrams and work through them step by step</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If stuck, try both methods (combinations and organized counting) to see which works</li>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. The Elimination Method (When Neither Variable is Isolated)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Key Concept: Elimination works by canceling out one variable</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">We cannot solve an equation with two variables</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">By making coefficients equal and opposite, one variable cancels when we add equations</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This leaves us with one equation and one unknown we can solve</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Step-by-Step Process:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Choose which variable to eliminate (usually the one that''s easiest)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Multiply one or both equations to make coefficients equal and opposite</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add the equations together (one variable cancels out)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Solve for the remaining variable</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 5:</strong> (If needed) Plug back into either original equation to find the other variable</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Example: 10x - 4y = 16 and 2x + 4y = 8, solve for y</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Eliminate x (easier because we need to solve for y)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Multiply second equation by -5:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• 10x - 4y = 16</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• -10x - 20y = -40</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Add equations (x cancels!):</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• -24y = -24</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: Solve: y = 1</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>When to use Elimination:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Neither variable is already isolated in either equation</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both equations are in standard form (Ax + By = C)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The coefficients are "nice" numbers that make elimination easy</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Pro Tip: Look for coefficients that already match or almost match</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">In the example above, the y-coefficients were already -4 and +4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sometimes you don''t need to multiply at all - just add or subtract!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. The Substitution Method (When One Variable is Already Isolated)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Key Concept: Substitution replaces a variable with its equivalent expression</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If one variable is already isolated (like y = something), use substitution</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Replace that variable in the other equation with the expression</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This gives you one equation with one unknown</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Step-by-Step Process:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Identify which variable is already isolated</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Substitute the expression into the other equation</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Solve for the remaining variable</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 4:</strong> (If needed) Plug back to find the other variable</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Example: 12x + 8y = 8 and y = 6x - 14, solve for x</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: y is already isolated in the second equation</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Substitute (6x - 14) for y in the first equation:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• 12x + 8(6x - 14) = 8</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Distribute and solve:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• 12x + 48x - 112 = 8</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• 60x - 112 = 8</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• 60x = 120</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• x = 2</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>When to use Substitution:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">One variable is ALREADY isolated (y = ..., x = ..., etc.)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">One variable has a coefficient of 1 or -1 (easy to isolate)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you see "y = " or "x = " in the problem, use substitution!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Common Mistake: Forgetting to distribute</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When substituting, make sure to distribute to ALL terms in parentheses</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 8(6x - 14) = 48x - 112, NOT 48x - 14 ❌</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

3. Word Problems: Setting Up Systems from Real Situations
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Key Concept: The ACT loves to hide systems of equations in word problems</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The hardest part is translating words into equations</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Once you have the equations, just use elimination or substitution</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for TWO different relationships between the same variables</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Common Word Problem Patterns:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Pattern #1: Total + Cost</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• One equation for total number of items</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• One equation for total cost (price × quantity)</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>Pattern #2: Tickets sold</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• One equation for total tickets</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• One equation for total revenue</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>Pattern #3: Two rates</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Distance = rate × time (two different scenarios)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Example: Mary buys 42 plants for $108. Tomato plants cost $3, pepper plants cost $2. How many pepper plants?</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Define variables</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Let x = tomato plants, y = pepper plants</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Write equation for TOTAL plants:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• x + y = 42</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Write equation for TOTAL cost:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• 3x + 2y = 108</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: Use elimination (multiply first equation by -3):</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• -3x - 3y = -126</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• 3x + 2y = 108</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Add: -y = -18 → y = 18</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Answer: 18 pepper plants</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Pro Tip: Always check which variable the question asks for!</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">In the example above, we need y (pepper plants), not x (tomato plants)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Eliminate the variable you DON''T need to find your answer faster</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Advanced Word Problems with 3+ Unknowns (The Backsolve Strategy)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Key Concept: Questions with 3+ unknowns are MUCH easier if you backsolve</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Setting up and solving 3 equations algebraically takes forever</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The answer choices give you the value to test - use them!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This strategy is faster, easier, and less error-prone</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Backsolve Strategy:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Pick an answer choice (start with B or C - they''re usually in the middle)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Use the relationships in the problem to find the other unknowns</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Check if all conditions are satisfied</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 4:</strong> If it works, you''re done! If not, try another answer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Example: Malik has $738 in $1, $5, and $20 bills. He has 5 more $5 bills than $20 bills, and 6 more $1 bills than $5 bills. How many $1 bills?</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Answer choices: A) 33  B) 38  C) 48  D) 53</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Try B) 38 $1 bills</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Use relationships to find other values:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• He has 6 more $1 bills than $5 bills</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• So $5 bills = 38 - 6 = 32 bills</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• He has 5 more $5 bills than $20 bills</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• So $20 bills = 32 - 5 = 27 bills</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Check total money:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• 38($1) + 32($5) + 27($20)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• = 38 + 160 + 540</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• = $738 ✓</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It works! Answer is B) 38</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Why Backsolve Works Better:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Algebraic solution requires writing 3 equations and complex substitution</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Backsolve takes 30 seconds with a calculator</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Much less room for algebra errors</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The ACT expects you to use this strategy - don''t overcomplicate it!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>When to Use Backsolve:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">3 or more unknowns</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The question asks "how many" and gives you numerical answer choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Word problems with multiple relationships between variables</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

5. Test-Taking Tips for Systems of Equations
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Tip #1: Choose your method based on what''s given</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">See "y = " or "x = "? → Use SUBSTITUTION</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both equations in standard form? → Use ELIMINATION</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">3+ unknowns with answer choices? → BACKSOLVE</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Tip #2: For word problems, always define your variables first</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Write "Let x = number of tomatoes" at the top</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This prevents confusion when writing equations</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Double-check which variable the question asks for!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Tip #3: Look for "total" and "cost" keywords</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Total items" → x + y = [number]</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Total cost" → [price₁]x + [price₂]y = [total]</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These two equations together = classic systems problem</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Tip #4: When backsolving, start with choice B or C</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Answer choices are usually in numerical order</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If B is too small, try C or D</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If B is too large, try A</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This narrows down options faster</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Tip #5: Check your answer makes sense</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If Mary bought 42 plants total, pepper plants can''t be 50!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use logic to eliminate obviously wrong answers</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This catches careless errors</li>
    </ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. Multiplying Binomials and FOIL
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Standard Form of a Quadratic: y = ax² + bx + c</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Quadratics contain a term to the second degree (x²)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You need to be able to multiply, factor, graph, and solve quadratics</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>FOIL: First, Outer, Inner, Last</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is the method for multiplying two binomials</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Example: (2x + 3)(x + 6)</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• First: 2x · x = 2x²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Outer: 2x · 6 = 12x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Inner: 3 · x = 3x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Last: 3 · 6 = 18</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Combine: 2x² + 12x + 3x + 18 = 2x² + 15x + 18</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>CRITICAL: Don''t Forget to FOIL Perfect Squares!</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Common Mistake:</strong> (x + 5)² ≠ x² + 25 ❌</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Correct:</strong> (x + 5)² = (x + 5)(x + 5) = x² + 10x + 25 ✓</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You MUST FOIL - don''t just square each term!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>"Easy to Factor" Quadratics - Memorize These Patterns!</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Perfect Square (Addition):</strong> (x + y)² = x² + 2xy + y²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Example: (x + 2)² = x² + 4x + 4</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>Perfect Square (Subtraction):</strong> (x - y)² = x² - 2xy + y²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Example: (x - 3)² = x² - 6x + 9</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>Difference of Squares:</strong> (x + y)(x - y) = x² - y²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Example: (x + 6)(x - 6) = x² - 36</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Recognize this pattern! x² - 36 factors to (x + 6)(x - 6)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Backsolve Strategy for Multiplication Problems:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Instead of expanding algebraically, pick a value for x (like x = 2)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Plug it into the original expression to get a number</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Then plug x = 2 into each answer choice - whichever matches is correct!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Factoring Quadratics
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Why Factor? To simplify expressions and find solutions/roots</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Factoring is the reverse of FOIL</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It lets you find where a quadratic crosses the x-axis</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It helps simplify complex fractions with quadratics</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>The "Box" Method for Factoring:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Factor 3x² - x - 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Place x² term (3x²) in top left, constant (-2) in bottom right</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Write factors of x² term outside box (3x and x)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Find numbers that multiply to -2 (try 2 and -1, or 1 and -2)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: Place numbers outside box so middle terms add to -x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 5: Read factors from outside: (3x + 2)(x - 1)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Recognize "Easy to Factor" patterns FIRST:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">x² - 36 → difference of squares → (x + 6)(x - 6)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">x² + 4x + 4 → perfect square → (x + 2)²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">x² - 6x + 9 → perfect square → (x - 3)²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These factor instantly if you recognize the pattern!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Using Factoring to Simplify Fractions:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Factor the numerator and denominator</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cancel common factors</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (x² - 7x + 12)/(x - 3) = (x - 3)(x - 4)/(x - 3) = x - 4</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Finding Solutions, Roots, x-intercepts, and Zeros
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>CRITICAL: All these terms mean THE SAME THING!</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solutions = Roots = x-intercepts = Zeros</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">They all refer to values of x where f(x) = 0</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">They are the x-coordinates where the parabola crosses the x-axis</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>How to Find Solutions:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Set the quadratic equal to zero</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Factor the quadratic</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Set each factor equal to zero</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: Solve for x in each equation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Example: Find roots of f(x) = x² - 11x + 18</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Set equal to zero: x² - 11x + 18 = 0</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Factor: (x - 2)(x - 9) = 0</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Set each factor to zero:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• x - 2 = 0  →  x = 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• x - 9 = 0  →  x = 9</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solutions: x = 2 and x = 9</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>If You Know One Solution, Find the Other Factor:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If x = 3 is a solution to x² - bx + 12 = 0...</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Then (x - 3) is a factor</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The other factor must multiply with (x - 3) to give +12 at the end</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">So: (x - 3)(x - 4) = x² - bx + 12</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Other factor is (x - 4)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Graphing Calculator Shortcut:</strong>

4. Quadratic Formula and the Discriminant
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>The Quadratic Formula - MEMORIZE THIS!</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For ax² + bx + c = 0:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;"><strong>x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use this when the quadratic is NOT easily factorable</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Most common on harder questions (30-45)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Step-by-Step with Quadratic Formula:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Find zeros of f(x) = x² - 8x + 4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Identify a = 1, b = -8, c = 4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Plug into formula: x = (8 ± √(64 - 16)) / 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Simplify under radical: x = (8 ± √48) / 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: Simplify radical: x = (8 ± 4√3) / 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 5: Divide all terms: x = 4 ± 2√3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solutions: x = 4 + 2√3 and x = 4 - 2√3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>The Discriminant: b² - 4ac</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is the part UNDER the square root in the quadratic formula</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It tells you HOW MANY solutions there are (without solving!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Discriminant Rules - MEMORIZE THESE:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>b² - 4ac > 0</strong> (positive) → 2 real solutions</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Parabola crosses x-axis at 2 points</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>b² - 4ac = 0</strong> (zero) → 1 real solution</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Parabola touches x-axis at exactly 1 point (vertex on x-axis)</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>b² - 4ac < 0</strong> (negative) → 0 real solutions (2 complex)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Parabola never crosses x-axis</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Example: How many real roots for 2x² - 7x + 9 = 0?</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Calculate discriminant: b² - 4ac = (-7)² - 4(2)(9)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">= 49 - 72 = -23</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Since -23 < 0, there are 0 real roots</li>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Solutions Appear as x-intercepts on the Graph</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When you have a factored form, you can immediately see the x-intercepts</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: y = (x + 2)(x - 4) has x-intercepts at x = -2 and x = 4</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Multiplicity: The Power of Each Factor</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Multiplicity tells you HOW the graph behaves at each x-intercept</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>Multiplicity = 1:</strong> Graph passes straight through x-axis</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Example: y = (x + 2)(x - 4)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• 2 solutions at x = -2 and x = 4</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>Multiplicity = 2:</strong> Graph bounces at x-axis (touches but doesn''t cross)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Example: y = (x - 1)²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• 1 solution at x = 1 (vertex touches x-axis)</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>Multiplicity = 3:</strong> Graph flattens and passes through x-axis</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Example: y = (x + 3)³</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• 1 solution at x = -3 (flattens then continues)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Reading Equations from Graphs:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Identify all x-intercepts</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: For each x-intercept, look at the behavior:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Passes straight through? → Multiplicity 1</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Bounces? → Multiplicity 2 (squared)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">• Flattens? → Multiplicity 3 (cubed)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Write the equation with correct powers</li>

A function is a mathematical relationship where each input produces exactly one output. Functions appear frequently on the ACT—you need to know how to evaluate them, combine them using <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">composite functions</strong>, and interpret various function notations.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. Function Basics and Evaluation
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The fundamental definition of a function:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For every value of x (the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">input</strong>), there is exactly one value of f(x) (the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">output</strong>)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The input appears inside the parentheses: f(3), f(x), f(a-11)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The output is what f(x) equals after you plug in the input</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">How to evaluate a function—plug in the input for x:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If f(x) = 5x - 2, then:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">f(3) = 5(3) - 2 = 13</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">f(-2x) = 5(-2x) - 2 = -10x - 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">f(a - 11) = 5(a - 11) - 2 = 5a - 57</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The input can be a number, variable, or entire expression—always plug it in for x!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: If f(x) = 3√x + 11, what is f(25)?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Plug 25 in for x: f(25) = 3√25 + 11</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Evaluate: 3(5) + 11 = 15 + 11 = 26</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Functions with two variables:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If f(x,y) = 4x - y², what is f(5, 2)?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Plug in 5 for x and 2 for y: f(5,2) = 4(5) - 2² = 20 - 4 = 16</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Same concept—just plug each value into its corresponding variable</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Working backwards—finding x when given f(x):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If f(x) = 10x/(x+4) and f(x) = 5, what is x?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Set up equation: 5 = 10x/(x+4)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cross multiply: 5(x+4) = 10x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solve: 5x + 20 = 10x → 20 = 5x → x = 4</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Composite Functions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">What is a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">composite function</strong>?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A function written inside another function</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: f(g(8)) means "plug g(8) into the function f"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The ACT frequently tests these—you need TWO methods to solve</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Method #1: Solve for the composite function first
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If f(x) = 3x + 10 and g(x) = x - 5, find f(g(8))</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Find f(g(x)) by plugging ALL of g(x) into f</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">f(g(x)) = 3(x - 5) + 10 = 3x - 15 + 10 = 3x - 5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Now plug in 8: f(g(8)) = 3(8) - 5 = 19</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Method #2: Work inside out
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Same problem: If f(x) = 3x + 10 and g(x) = x - 5, find f(g(8))</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Solve the inside function first: g(8) = 8 - 5 = 3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Now f(g(8)) = f(3)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Evaluate f(3): f(3) = 3(3) + 10 = 19</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both methods work—use whichever feels more natural!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">CRITICAL: Remember to FOIL when squaring binomials
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If f(x) = 2x² - 7 and g(x) = x + 3, find f(g(x-1))</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Find g(x-1): g(x-1) = (x-1) + 3 = x + 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Find f(x+2): f(x+2) = 2(x+2)² - 7</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: FOIL the binomial: 2(x² + 4x + 4) - 7</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: Distribute and simplify: 2x² + 8x + 8 - 7 = 2x² + 8x + 1</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Common mistake:</strong> (x+2)² ≠ x² + 4. You MUST multiply it out!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Other Function Notations
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The ACT uses different notation styles—memorize these operations:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Composite:</strong> (f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x))</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Sum:</strong> (f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Difference:</strong> (f - g)(x) = f(x) - g(x)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Product:</strong> (fg)(x) = f(x) × g(x)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Quotient:</strong> (f/g)(x) = f(x) ÷ g(x)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example with product notation:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If f(x) = 2x² + 1 and g(x) = x² - 1, find (fg)(x)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">(fg)(x) = f(x) × g(x) = (2x² + 1)(x² - 1)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">FOIL: 2x⁴ - 2x² + x² - 1 = 2x⁴ - x² - 1</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Don''t confuse operations:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">(f ∘ g)(x) means COMPOSITE (plug g into f)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">(fg)(x) means MULTIPLY f times g</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The little circle "∘" specifically means composite!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

5. Domain and Range
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Definitions you must know:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Domain:</strong> All possible input values (x-values)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Range:</strong> All possible output values (y-values or f(x)-values)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Finding domain—what x-values are NOT allowed:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cannot divide by zero: If f(x) = 1/(x-3), then x ≠ 3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cannot take square root of negative: If f(x) = √(x+5), then x ≥ -5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The domain is all real numbers EXCEPT these restrictions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Find the domain of f(x) = 1/(x² - 5x + 6)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The function is undefined when the denominator equals zero</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Set denominator to zero: x² - 5x + 6 = 0</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Factor: (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solutions: x = 2 and x = 3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Domain: All real numbers EXCEPT x = 2 and x = 3</li>
    </ul>

Function transformations describe how graphs shift, stretch, compress, or flip in the coordinate plane. All functions—lines, parabolas, cubics—follow the same four transformation rules.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. The Four Transformation Rules
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Rule 1: Numbers inside parentheses shift horizontally</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Adding a number shifts the function LEFT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Subtracting a number shifts the function RIGHT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">f(x + 2) shifts 2 units left</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">f(x - 3) shifts 3 units right</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Warning:</strong> The direction is OPPOSITE the sign!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Rule 2: Numbers outside parentheses shift vertically</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Adding a number shifts the function UP</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Subtracting a number shifts the function DOWN</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">f(x) + 4 shifts 4 units up</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">f(x) - 5 shifts 5 units down</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Rule 3: Negative sign in front flips vertically</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">-f(x) reflects the function over the x-axis</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Every y-value becomes its opposite</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If point (3, 5) is on f(x), then (3, -5) is on -f(x)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Rule 4: Coefficients cause vertical stretch or compression</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Coefficient > 1 causes vertical STRETCH</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Coefficient < 1 causes vertical COMPRESSION</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">3f(x) stretches vertically by factor of 3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">(1/2)f(x) compresses vertically to half height</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">CRITICAL: These rules work for ALL functions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Memorize the four rules once</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Apply them to lines, parabolas, cubics, or any function</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The ACT expects you to know these rules cold!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Transforming Lines
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Lines follow all four transformation rules:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For f(x) = x (the basic linear function):</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">f(x - 1) shifts right 1 unit</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">f(x) + 3 shifts up 3 units</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">3f(x) = 3x stretches vertically</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">-f(x) = -x flips over x-axis</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: The graph of 4x + 2y = 26 is shifted up 4 units. What is the y-coordinate of the new y-intercept?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Convert to slope-intercept form</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">2y = -4x + 26 → y = -2x + 13</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Find original y-intercept: (0, 13)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Shift up 4 units: 13 + 4 = 17</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">New y-intercept: (0, 17)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Transforming Parabolas
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Parabolas like f(x) = x² follow the same rules:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Horizontal shifts:</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">f(x) = (x + 2)² shifts 2 units LEFT (remember: opposite sign!)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">f(x) = (x - 3)² shifts 3 units RIGHT</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Vertical shifts:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">f(x) = x² + 1 shifts 1 unit UP</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">f(x) = x² - 4 shifts 4 units DOWN</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Vertical stretch/compression:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">f(x) = 3x² stretches by factor of 3 (narrower parabola)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">f(x) = (1/2)x² compresses to half height (wider parabola)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Stretch makes parabola steeper; compression makes it flatter</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Vertical flip:</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">f(x) = -x² flips upside down</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Opens downward instead of upward</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Transforming Cubics and Other Functions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Cubic functions like f(x) = x³ follow the same rules:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">f(x) = (x + 2)³ shifts 2 units left</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">f(x) = x³ + 1 shifts 1 unit up</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">f(x) = 4x³ stretches vertically by factor of 4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">f(x) = -x³ flips over x-axis</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">ANY function follows these rules:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Even if you see an unfamiliar function on the ACT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Apply the same four transformation rules</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Inside parentheses → horizontal (opposite sign)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Outside parentheses → vertical (same sign)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Negative in front → flip</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Coefficient → stretch or compress</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
5. Combining Multiple Transformations
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The ACT often tests multiple transformations at once:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: If f(x) = x², what is g(x) = -2(x + 3)² - 1?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Identify each transformation</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">(x + 3) → shift 3 units left</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">-2 coefficient → flip AND stretch by factor of 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">- 1 outside → shift 1 unit down</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Combined effect on the graph:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Start with basic parabola f(x) = x²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Shift 3 units left</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Flip upside down</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Stretch vertically by factor of 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Shift 1 unit down</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Vertex moves from (0, 0) to (-3, -1) and opens downward</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Order of operations matters:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Apply horizontal shifts first (inside parentheses)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Then apply flips and stretches (coefficients)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Finally apply vertical shifts (outside additions/subtractions)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

1. Basic Exponential Formulas
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The two standard forms for exponential equations:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Growth:</strong> A = P(1 + r)^t</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Decay:</strong> A = P(1 - r)^t</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Where P = <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">initial value</strong> (starting amount)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A = current value (amount after time t)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">r = rate of growth or decay (as a decimal)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">t = time interval (years, months, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Key difference between growth and decay:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Growth uses (1 + r) → value in parentheses is GREATER than 1</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Decay uses (1 - r) → value in parentheses is LESS than 1</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This makes the graph curve upward (growth) or downward (decay)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">CRITICAL: Always add or subtract from 1:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For 30% growth rate: Use (1 + 0.30) = 1.30, NOT just 0.30</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The "1" represents the original 100% you started with</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You''re adding or subtracting the percentage change to/from that 100%</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is the most common mistake students make!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Exponential Growth
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">What is <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">exponential growth</strong>?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A quantity increases by a fixed percentage rate over time</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The actual numerical increase gets LARGER each time period</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Examples: compound interest, population growth, viral spread</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Bank account with $100 earning 8% annual interest
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Formula: A = 100(1 + 0.08)^t = 100(1.08)^t</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">After 1 year: A = 100(1.08)^1 = $108</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">After 2 years: A = 100(1.08)^2 = $116.64</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Year 1 gain: $8 (8% of $100)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Year 2 gain: $8.64 (8% of $108)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The dollar amount increases even though the rate stays 8%</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Why exponential growth is NOT linear:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The percentage rate is constant, but the dollar amount changes</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You earn interest on your interest (compounding)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Graph has upward curve, gets steeper over time</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Y-intercept shows the initial value</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example problem: Julia''s bee hive increases by 30% every month. Starting with 50 bees, which equation models the population after m months?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Initial value P = 50 bees</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Growth rate r = 30% = 0.30</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Time = m months</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Formula: B = 50(1 + 0.30)^m = 50(1.3)^m</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">NOT 50(0.3)^m — must include the "1" for the original 100%!</li>

3. Exponential Decay
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">What is <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">exponential decay</strong>?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A quantity decreases by a fixed percentage rate over time</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The actual numerical decrease gets SMALLER each time period</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Examples: depreciation, radioactive decay, population decline</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Car purchased for $20,000 loses 10% of its value each year
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Formula: A = 20,000(1 - 0.10)^t = 20,000(0.90)^t</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">After 1 year: A = 20,000(0.90)^1 = $18,000</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">After 2 years: A = 20,000(0.90)^2 = $16,200</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Year 1 loss: $2,000 (10% of $20,000)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Year 2 loss: $1,800 (10% of $18,000)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The dollar loss decreases even though the rate stays 10%</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Graph characteristics for decay:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Downward curve, gets flatter over time</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Approaches zero but never reaches it</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Y-intercept shows initial value</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example problem: A newspaper has 24,000 subscribers and loses 12% per year. How many after 2 years?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Initial value P = 24,000</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Decay rate r = 12% = 0.12</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Time t = 2 years</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Formula: A = 24,000(1 - 0.12)^2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A = 24,000(0.88)^2 = 24,000(0.7744) = 18,585.6</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Approximately 18,590 subscribers</li>

4. General Exponential Form
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The ACT sometimes uses <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">general exponential form</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>y = ab^x</strong> where a ≠ 0 and b is positive and b ≠ 1</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">a = y-intercept (initial value when x = 0)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">b = rate of change (growth or decay factor)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">x = time interval</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">How to identify growth vs. decay from the equation:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If <strong>b > 1</strong> → exponential GROWTH (curve goes UP)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If <strong>0 < b < 1</strong> → exponential DECAY (curve goes DOWN)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Just look at the base b to determine the type!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example 1 (Growth): Population of 150 rhinos doubles every year
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Initial value a = 150</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Doubles means multiply by 2, so b = 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Equation: P(x) = 150(2)^x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Since b = 2 > 1, this is GROWTH</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example 2 (Decay): After pollution, one-third of fish survive each month. Initial population 12,000.
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Initial value a = 12,000</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">One-third survive means b = 1/3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Equation: F(x) = 12,000(1/3)^x</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Since b = 1/3 < 1, this is DECAY</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: Write A = P(1 ± r)^t</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Question Type 2: Calculate final value
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Given initial value, rate, and time</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Plug values into formula</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use calculator to evaluate</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Watch for "closest to" language—round appropriately</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Question Type 3: Interpret the graph
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Upward curve = growth</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Downward curve = decay</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Y-intercept = initial value</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Question Type 4: Distinguish exponential from linear
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Linear: "increases by 30 every month" → constant amount</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Exponential: "increases by 30% every month" → constant percentage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Watch for the % symbol!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>For 30% growth, use (1 + 0.30) = 1.30 NOT 0.30 alone—this is the most common mistake on exponential questions
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>In general form y = ab^x, check b to identify type: b > 1 means growth (upward curve), 0 < b < 1 means decay (downward curve)
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Exponential is NOT linear—constant percentage rate produces changing dollar amounts; y-intercept always shows initial value

Sequences are ordered lists of numbers following specific patterns. The ACT tests three types: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">arithmetic sequences</strong> (add/subtract a constant), <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">geometric sequences</strong> (multiply/divide by a constant), and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">recursive sequences</strong> (each term defined by previous terms).

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. Arithmetic Sequences
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">What is an <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">arithmetic sequence</strong>?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Uses addition or subtraction between consecutive terms</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">common difference</strong> (d) is constant</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24...</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Common difference d = +4 (add 4 each time)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Finding later terms—the visual method:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ALWAYS draw out the sequence first</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Fill in the values you know</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Count how many "jumps" between known terms</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Divide total difference by number of jumps to find d</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: 1st term is 3, 4th term is 24. Find the 5th term.
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Draw: 3 → ? → ? → 24 → ?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">From 1st to 4th term = 3 jumps</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Total difference: 24 - 3 = 21</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Common difference: d = 21 ÷ 3 = 7</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">5th term: 24 + 7 = 31</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The arithmetic sequence formula (for far-away terms):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>t_n = t_1 + d(n - 1)</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Where t_1 = first term</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">d = common difference</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">n = term number you want</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">t_n = the nth term</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">MEMORIZE this formula for test day!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example using the formula: Find the 88th term if t_1 = 3 and d = 7
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">t_88 = 3 + 7(88 - 1)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">t_88 = 3 + 7(87)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">t_88 = 3 + 609 = 612</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96...</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Common ratio r = ×2 (multiply by 2 each time)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Finding the common ratio:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Divide any term by the previous term</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">r = (2nd term) ÷ (1st term)</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">r = -280 ÷ 560 = -1/2</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Finding later terms—multiply repeatedly:

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Given t_1 = 560 and r = -1/2, find t_5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">t_1 = 560</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">t_2 = 560 × (-1/2) = -280</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">t_3 = -280 × (-1/2) = 140</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">t_4 = 140 × (-1/2) = -70</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">t_5 = -70 × (-1/2) = 35</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The geometric sequence formula (for far-away terms):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">t_5 = 560 × (-1/2)^(5-1)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">t_5 = 560 × (-1/2)^4</li>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Each term is defined using one or more previous terms</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The rule tells you how to get the next term</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You MUST work forward term by term—no shortcuts!</li>

4. Identifying Sequence Types
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Strategy 1: Check the differences
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Subtract consecutive terms: t_2 - t_1, t_3 - t_2, etc.</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If differences are constant → arithmetic sequence</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 5, 9, 13, 17 → differences are 4, 4, 4 → arithmetic with d = 4</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Strategy 2: Check the ratios
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Divide consecutive terms: t_2 ÷ t_1, t_3 ÷ t_2, etc.</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If ratios are constant → geometric sequence</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 2, 6, 18, 54 → ratios are 3, 3, 3 → geometric with r = 3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Strategy 3: Look for a recursive formula
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you see notation like s_n = f(s_(n-1)) → recursive</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Build the sequence term by term from initial value(s)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
5. Test-Taking Tips for Sequences
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For arithmetic sequences:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Draw the sequence and fill in known values</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Count jumps between terms to find common difference</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use formula t_n = t_1 + d(n-1) only for far-away terms</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For geometric sequences:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Find common ratio by dividing consecutive terms</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For nearby terms, multiply repeatedly</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use formula t_n = t_1 × r^(n-1) for far-away terms</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For recursive sequences:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Work forward term by term from initial value</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Write out each term as you calculate it</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cannot skip ahead—must do every step!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Memorize both formulas:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Arithmetic: t_n = t_1 + d(n-1)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Geometric: t_n = t_1 × r^(n-1)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both have (n-1) because you start from first term!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. Basic Trigonometry (SOH-CAH-TOA)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">SOH-CAH-TOA</strong> - Memorize this acronym:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>SOH:</strong> Sine = Opposite / Hypotenuse</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>CAH:</strong> Cosine = Adjacent / Hypotenuse</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>TOA:</strong> Tangent = Opposite / Adjacent</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ONLY works for right triangles!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Triangle with sides 9, 12, 15 (hypotenuse)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If opposite = 9 and adjacent = 12:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">sin(x) = 9/15</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">cos(x) = 12/15</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">tan(x) = 9/12</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Finding trig values when third side is unknown:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Pythagorean theorem</strong>: a² + b² = c²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: If hypotenuse = 7, one leg = 4, find other leg</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">4² + b² = 7²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">16 + b² = 49</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">b² = 33 → b = √33</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Then: tan(A) = 4/√33</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Drawing your own right triangle:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If no triangle given, sketch one!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: If sin(q) = 9/15 and tan(q) = 9/12</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Label opposite = 9, hypotenuse = 15 (from sine)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Label adjacent = 12 (from tangent)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Then find cos(q) = 12/15</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

2. Reciprocal Trig Functions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Three reciprocal functions (flip the fraction):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Cosecant (csc):</strong> Reciprocal of sine</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">csc(x) = Hypotenuse / Opposite</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Secant (sec):</strong> Reciprocal of cosine</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">sec(x) = Hypotenuse / Adjacent</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Cotangent (cot):</strong> Reciprocal of tangent</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">cot(x) = Adjacent / Opposite</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Find sec(q) if tan(q) = 15/13
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Draw triangle: opposite = 15, adjacent = 13</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Find hypotenuse: 13² + 15² = c²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">169 + 225 = c² → c² = 394 → c = √394</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">sec(q) = Hypotenuse / Adjacent = √394 / 13</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Shortcut for secant and cosecant:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Find cos(q) first, then flip to get sec(q)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Find sin(q) first, then flip to get csc(q)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Often faster than finding hypotenuse</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Using Trig to Find Side Lengths
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Setting up equations to solve for unknown sides:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Identify which trig function relates given info to unknown</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Set up equation using SOH-CAH-TOA</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solve algebraically for the unknown</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Triangle with angle 67°, hypotenuse = 9, find opposite side x
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use sine (opposite and hypotenuse)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">sin(67°) = x / 9</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Multiply both sides by 9: x = 9 sin(67°)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">To find numerical value: x ≈ 8.28</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">CRITICAL: Calculator mode matters!
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Angles in degrees → use DEGREE mode</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Angles in radians → use RADIAN mode</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Wrong mode gives completely wrong answer!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When given trig value instead of angle:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: cos(B) = 2/3 and AB = 6, find AC</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">cos(B) = Adjacent / Hypotenuse = BC / 6</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Set equal: BC / 6 = 2/3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solve: BC = 4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use Pythagorean theorem for other side</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Inverse Trigonometric Functions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">What <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">inverse trig functions</strong> do:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Find an unknown angle when side lengths are known</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">SOH-CAH-TOA flipped: angle is on one side, ratio on other</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Written as: sin⁻¹, cos⁻¹, tan⁻¹ (or arcsin, arccos, arctan)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The three inverse functions:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">sin⁻¹(Opposite / Hypotenuse) = angle</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">cos⁻¹(Adjacent / Hypotenuse) = angle</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">tan⁻¹(Opposite / Adjacent) = angle</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Triangle with opposite = 30, hypotenuse = 55, find angle A
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use sine (opposite and hypotenuse)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">sin(A) = 30 / 55</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Angle A = sin⁻¹(30/55)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">ACT usually gives answer choices with inverse trig notation</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If needed numerically: A ≈ 33.1°</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Key difference from regular trig:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Regular: sin(67°) = 0.92 (angle → ratio)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Inverse: sin⁻¹(0.92) = 67° (ratio → angle)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
5. The Pythagorean Identity
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Pythagorean identity</strong> (MUST memorize):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">True for ALL angles θ</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Whenever you see sin² or cos², use this identity</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Do NOT think of SOH-CAH-TOA for these problems</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: If 3sin²(θ) + 3cos²(θ) = a, find a
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Factor out 3: 3(sin²(θ) + cos²(θ)) = a</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use identity: sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Substitute: 3(1) = a</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Therefore: a = 3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Alternative: Substitution method
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pick any value for θ (like 30° or 45°)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Plug into calculator: 3sin²(30°) + 3cos²(30°)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Will always equal 3, no matter what angle!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This verifies the identity</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

6. Graphing Sine and Cosine Functions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Sine and cosine are <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">periodic functions</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">They repeat over and over again infinitely</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">X-axis usually labeled in radians (π radians = 180°)</li>

  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Basic sine function: f(x) = sin(x)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Returns to 0 at x = 2π, pattern repeats</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Amplitude</strong> - height of the function:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Defined by |A| where A is the coefficient</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">f(x) = A cos(x) or f(x) = A sin(x)</li>

</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Process: Use FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Multiply just like binomials</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Simplify using i² = -1</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Combine like terms</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: (3 - 5i)(2 - 2i)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">First: 3 × 2 = 6</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Outer: 3 × (-2i) = -6i</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Inner: (-5i) × 2 = -10i</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Last: (-5i) × (-2i) = 10i²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Combine: 6 - 6i - 10i + 10i²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">= 6 - 16i + 10i²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Substitute i² = -1: 6 - 16i + 10(-1)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">= 6 - 16i - 10</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">= -4 - 16i</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: (1 - 3i)(11 + 2i)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">FOIL: 11 + 2i - 33i - 6i²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Combine like terms: 11 - 31i - 6i²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Replace i²: 11 - 31i - 6(-1)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">= 11 - 31i + 6</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">= 17 - 31i</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Calculator shortcut:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Most TI-83, TI-84, TI-Nspire, and Casio calculators have an i button</li>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Same real part, opposite sign on imaginary part</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">General form: a + bi and a - bi are conjugates</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 2 + 3i and 2 - 3i are conjugates</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">To find conjugate: switch the sign of imaginary part</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">CRITICAL property:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Product of complex conjugates is always a REAL number</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">(a + bi)(a - bi) = a² + b²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Imaginary terms cancel out!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: (2 + 3i)(2 - 3i)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">FOIL: 4 - 6i + 6i - 9i²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">= 4 - 9i²</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">= 4 - 9(-1)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">= 4 + 9 = 13</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Shortcut: 2² + 3² = 4 + 9 = 13 (much faster!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Using conjugates to simplify fractions:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Cannot have i in the denominator!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Multiply top and bottom by conjugate of denominator</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Simplify 10/(1 - 2i)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Conjugate of (1 - 2i) is (1 + 2i)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Multiply: [10/(1 - 2i)] × [(1 + 2i)/(1 + 2i)]</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">= (10 + 20i) / (1² + 2²)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">= (10 + 20i) / 5</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">= 2 + 4i</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Simplify 5/(3 + 4i)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Conjugate of (3 + 4i) is (3 - 4i)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Multiply: [5/(3 + 4i)] × [(3 - 4i)/(3 - 4i)]</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">= (15 - 20i) / (9 + 16)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">= (15 - 20i) / 25</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">= 15/25 - 20i/25</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">= 3/5 - 4i/5</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">5 (no imaginary part) → point (5, 0)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">4i (no real part) → point (0, 4)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Note on importance:

5. Matrix Multiplication - Determining if Defined
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">CRITICAL concept: Matrix multiplication is different from addition!
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Matrices do NOT need same dimensions to multiply</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Instead, follow the "middle numbers must match" rule</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Order matters: AB ≠ BA (usually)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 1: Write dimensions of both matrices
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Multiply (1 × 2) matrix by (2 × 3) matrix</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Write: (1 × 2) × (2 × 3)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 2: Box the middle two numbers
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">(1 × [2) × (2] × 3)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Check if middle numbers match</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If they match → multiplication is DEFINED</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If they don''t match → multiplication is UNDEFINED</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 3: If defined, find result dimensions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Bring down first and last numbers (outside the box)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">(1 × [2) × (2] × 3) → result is (1 × 3)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The result matrix will be (1 × 3)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Key rule to remember:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Number of COLUMNS in first matrix</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">must equal</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Number of ROWS in second matrix</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For multiplication to be defined</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Examples:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">(2 × [3) × (3] × 1) → DEFINED, result is (2 × 1)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">(2 × [1) × (2] × 2) → UNDEFINED (1 ≠ 2)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">(2 × [2) × (2] × 2) → DEFINED, result is (2 × 2)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">(2 × [3) × (2] × 2) → UNDEFINED (3 ≠ 2)</li>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Multiply corresponding elements</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Add all products together</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Result goes in corresponding position</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: [[2, -4], [-6, 1]] × [[3, 1], [-2, 9]]
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Check if defined</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">(2 × 2) × (2 × 2) → defined, result is (2 × 2)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Find top-left element</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use top row of first [2, -4] and left column of second [3, -2]</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">= (2)(3) + (-4)(-2) = 6 + 8 = 14</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Find top-right element</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use top row of first [2, -4] and right column of second [1, 9]</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">= (2)(1) + (-4)(9) = 2 - 36 = -34</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 4: Find bottom-left element</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use bottom row of first [-6, 1] and left column of second [3, -2]</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">= (-6)(3) + (1)(-2) = -18 - 2 = -20</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 5: Find bottom-right element</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use bottom row of first [-6, 1] and right column of second [1, 9]</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">= (-6)(1) + (1)(9) = -6 + 9 = 3</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Result: [[14, -34], [-20, 3]]</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Test-taking tip:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Check answer choices after finding just ONE element!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Often only one answer choice has that value</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Can save time by not calculating all elements</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If multiple answers have same value, calculate another element</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example with different dimensions: (3 × 2) × (2 × 3)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Result will be (3 × 3) - bigger than either original!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Process is exactly the same</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Just more elements to calculate</li>

A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">vector</strong> is a quantity that has both magnitude (length) and direction. Vectors commonly are used to show motion, such as velocity and acceleration. Since vectors are not commonly taught in math class, many students are stumped when vectors appear on the ACT. The good news is that vector questions on the ACT primarily test vector addition and subtraction, which involves simple arithmetic with like terms.

1. Understanding Vectors
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">A vector shows the magnitude and direction of a motion
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Vectors are drawn as arrows on the coordinate plane</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The <strong>magnitude</strong> is the length of the vector (represents speed, distance, or strength)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The <strong>direction</strong> is shown by which way the arrow points</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: A car driving at 30° east of north at 10 mph would have magnitude 10 and direction 30° from north</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Vectors on the ACT are most commonly written in two forms:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Standard form:</strong> v = Ai + Bj
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Ai shows the x-component (horizontal movement)</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Bj shows the y-component (vertical movement)</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Example: 3i + 4j means 3 units right, 4 units up</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Component form:</strong> v = (A, B)
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">A shows the x-component</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">B shows the y-component</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Example: (3, 4) means 3 units right, 4 units up</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When starting at the origin, a vector written in Ai + Bj or (A, B) notation ends at point (A, B)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Combine the i terms (x-components)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Combine the j terms (y-components)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: (4i + 5j) + (-2i + 6j) = 2i + 11j</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When there''s a coefficient in front of a vector, distribute it first
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If A = 5i - j and we want 2A, distribute: 2A = 2(5i - j) = 10i - 2j</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: If A = 5i - j and B = 12i - 4j, then 2A - B = (10i - 2j) - (12i - 4j) = -2i + 2j</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Remember to distribute the negative sign when subtracting!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Common mistake: Forgetting to distribute the negative sign
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">WRONG: (3i + 4j) - (2i + j) = 3i + 4j - 2i + j = i + 5j ✗</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">RIGHT: (3i + 4j) - (2i + j) = 3i + 4j - 2i - j = i + 3j ✓</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

3. The Tip-to-Tail Method for Graphing
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For more advanced vector questions, you may need to visualize vector addition on a graph
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This uses the <strong>tip-to-tail method</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The "tip" is where the arrow points (the head of the arrow)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The "tail" is the straight end (where the arrow starts)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Steps for tip-to-tail method:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start at the origin and draw the first vector
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">If solving A + B + C, draw vector A first</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Where the tip (arrow head) lands is your new starting point</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start at the tip of the first vector and draw the second vector
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">The tail of the second vector starts where the tip of the first ended</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">This is why it''s called "tip-to-tail"</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Repeat for any additional vectors
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Keep connecting tail to tip</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Draw a vector from the origin to the final tip
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">This new vector represents your answer</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">It shows the combined effect of all the vectors</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When subtracting vectors on a graph:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Draw the vector in the opposite direction</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If +C goes 3 units right and 1 unit down, then -C goes 3 units left and 1 unit up</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Flip both the horizontal and vertical components</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: To find A + B - C graphically
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Draw A starting at origin</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Draw B starting at tip of A</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Draw -C (opposite direction of C) starting at tip of B</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Draw final vector from origin to tip of -C</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

4. Magnitude of a Vector
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The magnitude of a vector is the length of the vector
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Magnitude represents the speed, distance, or strength</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: A ball traveling at 40 feet per second has magnitude 40</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Magnitude is rarely tested on the ACT, but you should know the formula</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Formula for magnitude:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For vector Ai + Bj or (A, B): magnitude = √(A² + B²)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is the same as the Pythagorean theorem!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Magnitude of (3, 4) = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">If you forget the formula on test day:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Draw the vector on the coordinate plane</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Create a right triangle using the vector as the hypotenuse</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c²</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

5. Vectors in Context: Direction and Motion
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The ACT often presents vectors in real-world contexts
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Common scenarios: driving, flying, jogging, sailing</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The vector i represents 1 unit east (or right)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The vector j represents 1 unit north (or up)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Translating directions to vectors:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>East:</strong> positive i direction (example: 5 mph east = 5i)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>West:</strong> negative i direction (example: 9 mph west = -9i)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>North:</strong> positive j direction (example: 3 mph north = 3j)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>South:</strong> negative j direction (example: 7 mph south = -7j)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Sarah is jogging west at 9 miles per hour
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">West means negative i direction</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">9 miles per hour is the magnitude</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Vector: -9i</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Tia drives 5 miles south and 5√3 miles west
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">South = -5j</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">West = -5√3i</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Combined vector: -5√3i - 5j</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Angles and directions:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Questions may specify "30° north of east" or "45° east of north"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These typically require trigonometry to find exact components</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">But on the ACT, these questions usually just ask for magnitude or general direction</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

6. Key Takeaways
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0; color: #16a34a; font-weight: 600;">Vectors have two forms: standard form Ai + Bj and component form (A, B), where A is the x-component and B is the y-component</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0; color: #16a34a; font-weight: 600;">To add or subtract vectors, simply combine like terms: add the x-components together and add the y-components together (remember to distribute coefficients and negative signs!)</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0; color: #16a34a; font-weight: 600;">Use the tip-to-tail method for graphing vector addition: draw each vector starting at the tip of the previous one, then draw the result from origin to the final tip</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0; color: #16a34a; font-weight: 600;">Magnitude of vector (A, B) is √(A² + B²), which is the same as the Pythagorean theorem</li>

Word problems are one of the most challenging aspects of the ACT Math Test. Word problems can cover any math topic—from algebra to geometry to probability—and are often written in confusing ways that make it difficult to figure out exactly what is being asked. The good news is that word problems at their core are no more difficult than any other ACT Math questions. This lesson will teach you powerful strategies to tackle word problems more effectively and efficiently.

1. Don''t Be Intimidated
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Word problems look scary, but they don''t have to be
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Many students see a big paragraph and think "no way, I can''t solve that"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">They feel intimidated before even trying to solve the question</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t let this be you!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Word problems are just regular math problems dressed up in words
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">At their core, they test the same skills as any other ACT Math question</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The challenge is translating words into math</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Once you do that, the problem becomes much simpler</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Mindset matters
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When you see a big paragraph on test day, take a deep breath</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solve it one step at a time</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Breaking it down makes it manageable</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Turn Words into Equations
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">This is the most powerful strategy for word problems
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read through the question one sentence at a time</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Identify each piece of key information</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Write it down as an equation or mathematical expression</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">If you can convert the word problem into equations, it becomes much easier to solve
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The price of Matt''s meal was $6 more than John''s meal" → M = J + 6</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "They split the cost evenly" → Each pays (J + M) / 2</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Common translations from words to math:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>"More than"</strong> → Addition (+)
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">"5 more than x" → x + 5</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>"Less than"</strong> → Subtraction (-)

          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">"3 less than y" → y - 3</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>"Times" or "product of"</strong> → Multiplication (×)
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">"6 times as many" → 6x</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>"Per" or "divided by"</strong> → Division (÷)
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">"200 cubic inches per minute" → 200/min</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>"Is" or "equals"</strong> → Equals sign (=)
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">"The total is 100" → Total = 100</li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">System of equations word problems
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">One of the most common types of word problems</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You''ll need to turn the word problem into two equations</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Once you have the equations, solve using substitution or elimination</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "10 bagels and 3 tubs of cream cheese cost $24.40. 16 bagels cost $22.72"
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Equation 1: 10b + 3c = 24.40</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Equation 2: 16b = 22.72</li>

3. Backsolve with the Answer Choices
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Sometimes writing your own equations is difficult or time-consuming
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">In these cases, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">backsolving</strong> can be faster and easier</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Take the answer choices and work backwards through the problem</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">See which answer choice satisfies all the conditions in the problem</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">How to backsolve effectively:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start with answer choice C (the middle value)
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Answer choices are usually listed in order</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">If C doesn''t work, you can often tell if you need a larger or smaller value</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Plug the answer choice into the problem
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Go through each step described in the word problem</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">See if the numbers work out correctly</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Check if it satisfies all conditions
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">If yes, you found the answer!</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">If no, try the next logical answer choice</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When backsolving is especially useful:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When setting up equations seems complicated</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When you''re not confident your equation is correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When the problem involves multiple steps that are easier to check than to set up</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Benefits of backsolving:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Even if you can''t find the right answer, you can often eliminate wrong answers</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This allows you to make a better guess</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It''s a safety net when algebraic approaches fail</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Create a visual representation of the problem
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Drawing a picture, table, or diagram can clarify what''s happening</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is especially helpful for geometry word problems</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Rate problems (distance = rate × time) benefit from a table</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Label what you know and what you need to find
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Write down all given information clearly</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Circle or underline what the question is asking for</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This prevents you from solving for the wrong thing</li>
    </ul>

5. Time Management and Strategic Guessing
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Don''t waste too much time on a single word problem
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It''s easy to waste minutes reading and rereading confusing word problems</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Students who do this often run out of time on the ACT Math test</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Time spent on one hard problem could be better used answering several easier ones</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Know when to guess and move on
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you''ve tried the strategies and still have no idea, it''s time to guess</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Circle the question in your test booklet so you can find it later</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Bubble in your best guess</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Move on to questions you know how to solve</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Giving up quickly might actually improve your score
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This sounds backwards, but it''s true!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Saving those precious minutes for other questions is strategic</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You can always come back if you have time remaining</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Coming back to problems with fresh eyes
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you complete the rest of the section and have time, return to circled questions</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sometimes when re-reading, you''ll suddenly see how to solve it</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It''s easier to think clearly when you''re not worried about finishing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Eliminate obviously wrong answers
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Even if you can''t solve the problem, you can often rule out some choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Is the answer clearly too big or too small?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Does it have the wrong units?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Eliminating even one answer choice increases your guessing odds</li>

6. Key Takeaways
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0; color: #16a34a; font-weight: 600;">Don''t be intimidated by word problems—they test the same math skills as other questions, just dressed up in words; take a deep breath and solve one step at a time</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0; color: #16a34a; font-weight: 600;">Turn words into equations by reading one sentence at a time and translating key information into mathematical expressions; this makes complex problems much easier to solve</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0; color: #16a34a; font-weight: 600;">Use backsolving when setting up equations is difficult: start with answer choice C, plug it into the problem, and check if it satisfies all conditions</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0; color: #16a34a; font-weight: 600;">Manage your time wisely—if you''re stuck after trying the strategies, guess and move on to save time for questions you can solve; you can always come back later with fresh eyes</li>

1. Venn Diagrams
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Venn diagram</strong> is a diagram of overlapping circles that helps visualize the logical relationship between sets and their elements
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Each circle represents a group or category</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The overlapping region represents elements that belong to both groups</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The area outside the circles (but inside a rectangle) represents elements in neither group</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">How to solve Venn diagram problems:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Draw the Venn diagram with two overlapping circles
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Always draw your own diagram—don''t try to solve it mentally</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start with the overlapping region (the "both" category)
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">This is given directly in most problems</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Label this region first</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Find the "only" regions by subtracting
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">"Only A" = Total A - Both</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">"Only B" = Total B - Both</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Find "neither" by subtracting from the total
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Neither = Total - (Only A + Both + Only B)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: 23 students total, 14 play tennis, 10 play soccer, 4 play both
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both = 4 (given directly)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Only tennis = 14 - 4 = 10</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Only soccer = 10 - 4 = 6</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Neither = 23 - (10 + 4 + 6) = 23 - 20 = 3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

2. Made-Up Math and Function Notation
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The ACT sometimes includes terms or symbols that are entirely made-up
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These questions confuse students because they''ve never seen the symbol before</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">But they''re just function questions in disguise!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t freak out—stay calm and read carefully</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">How to solve made-up math problems:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Read the definition of the made-up symbol
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">The problem will always define what the symbol means</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Example: a⊗b = 3a² - 4b</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Identify what you''re being asked to find
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Example: Find 5⊗9</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Substitute the given values into the definition
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">a = 5, b = 9</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">5⊗9 = 3(5)² - 4(9)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Simplify
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">= 3(25) - 36</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">= 75 - 36 = 39</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Common made-up symbols: ⊗, ⊕, *, #, ◊, △
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">None of these have standard meanings in math</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The ACT will always define them in the problem</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

3. Logic and Contrapositive Statements
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Logic questions ask you to determine which statement must be true based on a given statement
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These seem confusing at first</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">But there''s a simple trick: look for the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">contrapositive</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The contrapositive rule:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Original statement:</strong> If A, then B</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Contrapositive:</strong> If not B, then not A</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The contrapositive MUST ALWAYS be true when the original is true</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">How to create the contrapositive:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Switch the order (B and A swap positions)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Negate both (add "not" to both parts)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: "If it is Monday, there is bad traffic"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A = Monday, B = bad traffic</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Contrapositive: If there is NOT bad traffic, it is NOT Monday</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This must be true!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Common wrong answers to avoid:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">WRONG: "If not A, then B" (negating only one part)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">WRONG: "If B, then A" (switching order without negating)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">RIGHT: "If not B, then not A" (switch AND negate both)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Pattern Spotting and Sequences
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Pattern spotting questions present problems that seem overwhelming until you spot the pattern
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Once you spot the pattern, solving is easy</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The challenge is finding the pattern in the first place</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">How to approach pattern problems:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Look at what changes from one element to the next
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Does the size increase? By how much?</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Does the number of elements change? By what factor?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Extend the pattern to the requested term
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Don''t try to jump directly to the answer</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Work step by step if needed</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Calculate what the question asks for
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Often asks for perimeter, area, or number of elements</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example: Square patterns growing by 1 on each side
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Element 1: 1×1 square</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Element 2: 2×2 square</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Element 3: 3×3 square</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pattern: Element n is an n×n square</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Element 5: 5×5 square, so if each small square has side 14 inches, then perimeter = 4(5 × 14) = 280 inches</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
5. Mapping and Distance Problems
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Mapping questions ask students to track movements and make conclusions about final position
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These involve following directions like "drive 2 miles north, then 5 miles east"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The key strategy: ALWAYS draw your own map</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">How to solve mapping problems:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Draw a simple coordinate system or map
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Mark the starting point</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Use arrows to show directions (N, S, E, W)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Trace each movement on your map
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Draw lines for each leg of the journey</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Label distances on each line</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Calculate net displacement or total distance
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Net displacement: How far from start to finish "as the crow flies"</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Total distance: Sum of all individual movements</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Tips for tracking movements:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Track net east/west movement separately from net north/south</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "8 miles east then 2 miles west" = net 6 miles east</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Drawing the map makes these calculations much clearer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

6. Advanced Topics: Puzzles and Binomial Theorem
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Puzzle questions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Require more problem-solving skills than traditional math skills</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Often some of the most difficult to prepare for</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Most commonly appear in the last 15 questions of the test</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Can be very time-consuming</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Strategy:</strong> Skip these if you don''t immediately know how to solve, and save them for last</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Optimization problems like "maximize the number of items that fit in a space"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Pascal''s Triangle and Binomial Theorem (rarely tested)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Used to expand binomials like (a + b)ⁿ where n is large</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Pascal''s Triangle:</strong> Each row gives coefficients for (a + b)ⁿ
        <ul style="margin: 0.2rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Row 0: 1 → (a + b)⁰ = 1</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Row 1: 1, 1 → (a + b)¹ = 1a + 1b</li>
          <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Row 2: 1, 2, 1 → (a + b)² = 1a² + 2ab + 1b²</li>

7. Key Takeaways
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0; color: #16a34a; font-weight: 600;">For Venn diagrams, always draw your own diagram and start by labeling the overlapping "both" region first, then find the "only" regions by subtracting, and finally find "neither" by subtracting from the total</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0; color: #16a34a; font-weight: 600;">Made-up math symbols are just functions in disguise—read the definition carefully, substitute the given values, and simplify</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0; color: #16a34a; font-weight: 600;">For logic problems, find the contrapositive: if the original statement is "If A, then B," the contrapositive is "If not B, then not A" (switch order AND negate both parts)</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0; color: #16a34a; font-weight: 600;">These miscellaneous topics are rarely tested, so master the more common topics first; when you encounter puzzles or very difficult questions, skip them and save them for last to manage your time effectively</li>

With only 35 minutes to read four passages and answer 40 questions, you must develop efficient reading techniques that balance speed with accuracy.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">This lesson provides a comprehensive overview of the Reading section structure, explains what skills are tested, introduces the four passage types you''ll encounter, and outlines proven strategies for maximizing your score on this fast-paced section.</p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 1. Understanding the Reading Section Format </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The ACT Reading section is the third section of the test and consists of four passages with ten questions each. You have exactly 35 minutes to complete all 40 questions, which means approximately 8 minutes and 45 seconds per passage including both reading time and question-answering time.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Understanding the structure and format of this section is essential for developing an effective test-taking strategy.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Section Timing and Question Distribution </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">40 questions: . Each passage is approximately 750-900 words long and accompanied by exactly 10 questions. Unlike some standardized tests where passages vary in difficulty, all four ACT Reading passages are designed to be roughly equivalent in challenge level</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">However, individual students may find certain passage types easier based on their interests and background knowledge. The strict time constraint—just over 8.5 minutes per passage—makes the Reading section one of the most time-pressured parts of the ACT. Most students report that finishing all four passages is their biggest challenge.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Passage Order and Organization </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Humanities:</strong> (third), and</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Natural Science: (fourth). However, you are NOT required to complete the passages in this order. Strategic test-takers often rearrange the order to tackle their strongest passage types first, building confidence and banking time for more challenging passages later. Each passage is clearly labeled with its type, author information</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">sometimes a brief italicized introduction that provides context. Questions are numbered consecutively from 1-40 across all four passages (not 1-10 for each passage), so passage one has questions 1-10, passage two has questions 11-20, and so on.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Question Format and Answer Choices </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">four answer options: (A, B, C, D). Unlike the ACT English section which has three-choice questions</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Reading questions always have four choices. Each question has exactly one correct answer, and there is</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">no penalty for guessing: —wrong answers do not subtract from your score. Questions appear to the right of the passage (or below it in the online format)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">you can refer back to the passage as many times as needed. Most questions are passage-based, meaning you must find evidence in the text to support your answer. A few questions may ask about vocabulary in context or require you to make reasonable inferences based on textual clues.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Scoring and Raw-to-Scale Conversion </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Your Reading section score is based on the number of questions you answer correctly, called your raw score. This raw score (0-40) is then converted to a scaled score from 1-36 using a conversion table that varies slightly from test to test to account for minor difficulty differences.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Generally, missing 2-3 questions still allows you to achieve a score in the 33-35 range, while missing 6-8 questions typically results in a score around 28-30. The conversion is designed so that a scaled score of 36 requires a perfect or near-perfect raw score (39-40 correct), while a scaled score of 20 (roughly average) corresponds to answering about 23-26 questions correctly.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Because the scoring curve is relatively generous at the top end, even high-achieving students can afford to miss a few questions and still receive excellent scores.</p> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Example: Section Breakdown</strong><br><br> Passage 1 (Prose Fiction): Questions 1-10 | ~8:45 minutes<br> Passage 2 (Social Science): Questions 11-20 | ~8:45 minutes<br> Passage 3 (Humanities): Questions 21-30 | ~8:45 minutes<br> Passage 4 (Natural Science): Questions 31-40 | ~8:45 minutes<br><br> Total: 40 questions in 35 minutes = approximately 52.5 seconds per question, but you must account for reading time as well, which is why the per-passage timing works better as a guide. </p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 2. The Four Passage Types Explained </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Each ACT Reading section contains exactly four passages, each representing a different content area. Understanding the characteristics of each passage type helps you know what to expect and allows you to develop specialized strategies for each category.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">While the question types remain similar across all passages, the content, writing style, and focus differ significantly.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Prose Fiction and Literary Narrative </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Prose Fiction/Literary Narrative:</strong> passage is always the first passage and features excerpts from short stories, novels, memoirs, or personal essays. These passages focus on</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">literary devices: . You''ll need to understand character motivations, identify tone and mood, track plot developments, and interpret figurative language. Questions often ask about a character''s emotions, the narrator''s perspective, or the significance of specific events. Literary passages can be challenging because they require careful attention to nuance, subtext</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">implied meanings rather than just explicit facts. To succeed with fiction passages, pay attention to dialogue, character interactions, descriptive details, and shifts in tone or perspective.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Social Science </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Social Science:</strong> passage appears second and covers topics from anthropology, archaeology, biography, business, economics, education, geography, history, political science, psychology, and sociology. These passages present</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">theories: in an informative, expository style. Questions typically test your ability to identify main ideas, understand supporting details, recognize cause-and-effect relationships, and follow the author''s argument or analysis</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Social Science passages tend to be more straightforward than fiction because they explicitly state facts and conclusions rather than implying them. However, they may contain dense information that requires careful tracking of multiple concepts, names, dates, or statistics. Strong annotation and note-taking strategies are particularly useful for these passages.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Humanities </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Humanities:</strong> passage is third and includes content related to architecture, art, dance, ethics, film, language, literary criticism, music, philosophy, radio, television, and theater. These passages often discuss</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">critical analysis of creative works: . The writing style falls somewhere between Literary Narrative and Social Science—more personal and opinion-based than pure exposition but more analytical than storytelling</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Questions may ask you to identify the author''s perspective on an artist or movement, understand historical context, or recognize how the author supports their claims about cultural significance. Humanities passages sometimes include the author''s personal reflections or evaluative judgments, so pay attention to distinguishing between objective facts and subjective opinions.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Natural Science </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Natural Science:</strong> passage appears fourth and covers topics from anatomy, astronomy, biology, botany, chemistry, ecology, geology, medicine, meteorology, microbiology, natural history, physiology, physics, technology, and zoology. These passages explain</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">technological innovations: . The writing is typically expository and informative, similar to what you''d find in a science textbook or popular science magazine. Questions test whether you understand scientific processes, can identify cause-and-effect relationships, comprehend technical vocabulary in context</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">follow the logic of scientific explanations. Don''t worry if you''re not familiar with the specific scientific topic—all necessary information is provided in the passage. However, Natural Science passages can be challenging due to complex terminology, detailed descriptions of processes, and abstract concepts that require visualization.</li></ul> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Example: Passage Type Characteristics Prose Fiction: Focus on character emotions, narrative perspective, and literary themes. Look for "The narrator feels..." or "The passage suggests that the character..." Social Science: Focus on factual information, historical context, and analytical arguments</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Look for "According to the passage..." or "The author indicates that..." Humanities: Focus on artistic significance, cultural analysis, and the author''s perspective. Look for "The author believes..." or "The passage describes the artist''s work as..." Natural Science: Focus on scientific processes, technical explanations, and cause-effect relationships</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Look for "The passage explains that..." or "According to the research described..."</p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 3. Core Skills Tested in the Reading Section </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The ACT Reading section assesses three main categories of reading comprehension skills: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Key Ideas and Details</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Craft and Structure</strong>, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Integration of Knowledge and Ideas</strong>. Understanding which skills are being tested helps you approach questions more strategically and develop targeted improvement strategies. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Key Ideas and Details (55-60% of questions) </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">identify cause-effect relationships: . Questions might ask: "What is the main idea of the passage?", "According to the passage, what caused X to happen?", "The author indicates that...", or "Which of the following statements about X is supported by the passage?" These questions require close reading and the ability to distinguish between major themes and supporting details</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">When answering Key Ideas questions, always refer back to the passage—don''t rely on memory or outside knowledge. The correct answer will have direct textual support, even if the question requires you to paraphrase or synthesize information from multiple sentences.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Craft and Structure (25-30% of questions) </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">rhetorical strategies: . You might encounter questions like: "As it is used in line 42, the word ''revolutionary'' most nearly means...", "The author''s tone in the third paragraph can best be described as...", "The primary purpose of the first paragraph is to...", or "From whose perspective is the passage told?" To answer these questions successfully, pay attention not just to what the author says but how they say it</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Consider the connotations of specific word choices, the emotional effect of descriptive language, the organizational structure of paragraphs, and the overall rhetorical approach the author takes to convey their message.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Integration of Knowledge and Ideas (13-18% of questions) </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">draw conclusions: . Questions might ask: "Which of the following claims is best supported by evidence in the passage?", "The passage suggests that...", "It can reasonably be inferred that...", or "The author would most likely agree with which statement?" These questions require you to go beyond literal comprehension and think critically about implications, assumptions</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">logical connections. When the passage presents two texts (which happens occasionally), Integration questions may ask you to compare and contrast the authors'' perspectives or synthesize information from both passages. Strong critical thinking skills and the ability to distinguish between what the passage explicitly states versus what it implies are essential for these questions.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Reading Comprehension vs. Reading Speed </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">reading efficiency: . Unlike untimed reading assignments where you can reread multiple times and think deeply about every sentence</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">the ACT requires you to balance thorough understanding with time constraints. The most successful students develop</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">active reading strategies: that allow them to extract essential information quickly while still retaining enough detail to answer questions accurately. This means learning to identify what''s important (main ideas, key supporting details, author''s purpose) versus what''s less critical (minor examples, tangential descriptions) during your first read-through</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">With practice, you can improve both your reading speed and comprehension simultaneously by training yourself to recognize patterns in passage structure and question types.</li></ul> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Example: Question Type Distribution</strong><br><br> In a typical Reading section:<br> - 22-24 questions test Key Ideas and Details (main ideas, supporting details, sequences, cause-effect)<br> - 10-12 questions test Craft and Structure (vocabulary, author''s purpose, tone, point of view)<br> - 5-7 questions test Integration of Knowledge and Ideas (inferences, arguments, conclusions)<br><br> Knowing this distribution helps you anticipate what skills you''ll need to apply most frequently and where to focus your practice efforts. </p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 4. Building a Foundation for Success </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Mastering the ACT Reading section requires more than just understanding the format and question types—you need to develop <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">systematic strategies</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">efficient reading habits</strong>, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">test-taking discipline</strong>. This section introduces foundational concepts that will support your development as a strategic ACT reader. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Developing Active Reading Techniques </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Active reading:</strong> means engaging with the text purposefully rather than passively absorbing words. On the ACT, this involves</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">annotation:</strong> (underlining key phrases, circling important names or dates, making brief margin notes)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">prediction:</strong> (anticipating what information might be tested), and</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">summarization: (mentally paraphrasing each paragraph''s main point as you read). Active reading keeps your mind focused and helps you retain information better than passive reading</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Even simple techniques like underlining topic sentences or putting brackets around important examples can significantly improve your ability to locate information when answering questions. However, avoid over-annotating—excessive marking can be just as ineffective as no annotation at all. Focus on highlighting only the most essential information.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Understanding the Relationship Between Passages and Questions </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">passage-based comprehension:</strong> which means every correct answer must be supported by evidence in the text. Questions generally follow the</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">chronological order: of the passage—questions 1-3 relate to the beginning, questions 4-7 to the middle, and questions 8-10 to the end. However, some questions (particularly main idea or author''s purpose questions) require you to consider the entire passage</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Understanding this relationship helps you work more efficiently: when you see a question about a specific detail, you know approximately where in the passage to look based on the question number. Questions also frequently include</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">line references:</strong> (e.g., "In lines 45-48...") or</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">paragraph references:</strong> (e.g., "The third paragraph primarily serves to...") to guide you to the relevant section.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Recognizing Wrong Answer Patterns </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">wrong answer traps:</strong> is just as important as identifying correct answers. The ACT frequently uses several types of incorrect answer choices:</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">too extreme:</strong> (using absolute language like "always" or "never" when the passage is more nuanced)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">distortion:</strong> (twisting information from the passage in a way that changes its meaning)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">out of scope:</strong> (bringing in outside information or addressing topics not discussed in the passage)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">opposite:</strong> (stating the reverse of what the passage says), and</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">partially correct: (including some accurate information but also containing a critical error)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Learning to identify these patterns allows you to  wrong answers more quickly and confidently, even when you''re not 100% certain which answer is correct.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Creating a Personal Strategy and Improving Through Practice </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">personalized approaches: based on their strengths, weaknesses, and natural reading preferences. Some students prefer to skim the passage quickly first, then read questions and return to find answers</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Others read carefully the first time, annotating heavily, then answer questions from memory before checking the passage. Still others read questions first to know what to look for, then read the passage with those questions in mind.

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Students who struggle on the ACT Reading Test typically face two main challenges: time management and difficulty distinguishing between correct and incorrect answer choices. These seven core principles will help you understand how the Reading Test works and guide you toward more accurate answer selection throughout this course.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. Evidence-Based Answers
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The correct answer must be <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">supported by evidence in the passage</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The ACT must be able to point to specific text and say "here is why this answer choice is correct"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">There is ALWAYS evidence in the passage for the correct answer</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Once you find the correct evidence, the right answer choice becomes obvious</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Why This Matters
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Your goal is to find the evidence, not to guess or make assumptions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Think of it as "Find Your Waldo" - the evidence exists, you just need to locate it</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Most incorrect answers happen because students don''t find the right evidence, not because they can''t comprehend it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. 100% Correctness Requirement
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The correct answer must be <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">100% correct</strong> - every single word must be accurate
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read every single word in each answer choice carefully</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Watch for strong or specific statements that may not be fully supported by the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Even small differences between the answer choice and passage text make it incorrect</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example of Why Every Word Matters
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Answer choice: "Sea turtles eat a diet consisting <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">mostly of fish</strong> during migration"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Passage says: "Sea turtles eat fish, crabs, and seagrass during their annual migration"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This answer is INCORRECT because "mostly fish" is not the same as "fish, crabs, and seagrass"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The word "mostly" makes the entire answer choice wrong, even though turtles do eat fish</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Single Word Invalidation
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">single word can make the entire answer choice incorrect</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Even if 90% of an answer choice matches the passage perfectly, one wrong word makes it incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Be very picky and consider every single word as you assess each answer choice</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Anything wrong with an answer choice makes the entire choice incorrect</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Common Words That Invalidate Answers
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Watch for extreme or absolute language
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Words like "always," "never," "only," "exclusively," "primarily," "mostly"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These words make very specific claims that must be fully supported by the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the passage doesn''t explicitly support the extreme language, the answer is wrong</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Avoiding Keyword Matching Traps
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Do not just match words from the passage - <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">match the entire answer choice</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The ACT often includes incorrect answer choices that use exact words or phrases from the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Having exact wording doesn''t make an answer correct if the overall meaning doesn''t match</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sometimes the correct answer choice uses different words but captures the same meaning</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
How to Avoid This Trap
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Strategy for keyword matching
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t get excited when you see exact words from the passage - read the full answer choice</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use Principles #2 and #3: verify that the ENTIRE answer choice is 100% correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Compare the meaning and context, not just individual words</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
5. Find Your Waldo Strategy
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Finding the right evidence is like playing <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"Where''s Waldo"</strong> - it''s there, you just need to locate it
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The challenge isn''t comprehension - it''s finding the evidence quickly</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Once you find the right evidence, the correct answer becomes obvious</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You should always be able to point to specific lines and say "this is why my answer is correct"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
No Storytelling Allowed
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">If you''re creating a long justification for why an answer "could" be correct, it''s probably wrong
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">There is always clear evidence in the passage to support the correct answer</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You should never need to go through mental gymnastics to justify an answer</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Put your finger on the evidence and let it speak for itself</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
6. Speed Over Comprehension
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The ACT Reading Test is <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">more about speed than deep comprehension</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">40 minutes for 4 passages with 9 questions each = significant time pressure</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Most students don''t find the passages themselves difficult - the challenge is time management</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">With an extra 5 minutes, the test would be much easier for most students</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
How to Read for Speed
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Adjust your reading approach
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t read for depth - the questions won''t require deep analysis</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Focus on remembering where specific details are located throughout the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read slightly faster than you normally would for other texts requiring deeper understanding</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You can always return to specific sections when answering questions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Key Takeaways
</h3>

<ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>The correct answer must be 100% correct with evidence in the passage - every single word matters. A single incorrect word invalidates the entire answer choice, even if 90% of it matches the passage. Your job is to find the evidence (Find Your Waldo!) and verify that the complete answer choice is fully supported.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Don''t fall for keyword matching traps - match the entire answer choice to the passage, not just individual words. The ACT deliberately includes incorrect answers with exact phrases from the passage to mislead you. Focus on whether the complete meaning and context match, not just whether specific words appear.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">

    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>The ACT Reading Test is more about speed than deep comprehension - you have just 40 minutes for 4 passages and 36 questions. Don''t read for depth; instead, focus on remembering where details are located so you can find evidence quickly. The challenge is time management, not understanding the passages themselves.

Now that you understand the core principles distinguishing correct from incorrect answer choices, you need three essential strategies to find the right answer consistently and efficiently. You should apply these three strategies to every single question on the ACT Reading Test for maximum accuracy and speed.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. Put Your Finger on the Evidence
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">There is <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">always evidence for the correct answer</strong> in the passage
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Remember: ACT Reading is like "Where''s Waldo" - the challenge is finding the evidence quickly enough</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you can put your finger on evidence that matches the answer choice, you know you found the correct answer</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Doing this for every question will result in a fantastic ACT Reading score</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
When to Use This Strategy
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Balance between thoroughness and time management
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Finding evidence for every single question can be difficult and time-consuming</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Do not rely only on this strategy - sometimes you can''t find the evidence and need to move on</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is an important time management consideration we''ll discuss more later in the course</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
How to Apply This Strategy
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Concrete steps for finding evidence
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read the question and identify what specific information it''s asking for</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Locate the relevant section of the passage (use line numbers if provided)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Literally put your finger on the text that supports your answer</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Match that evidence to the answer choice that says the same thing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Read Like a Lawyer
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Read and consider <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">every single word carefully</strong> in both questions and answer choices
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When reading the question, make sure you understand exactly what it''s asking</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When reading answer choices, read critically and look for any specific details that could make it incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Remember: the correct answer must be 100% correct</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
What "Reading Like a Lawyer" Means
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Critical reading skills to apply
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Question every word - don''t skim or assume you know what it says</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for qualifiers like "mostly," "primarily," "only," "always," "never"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Verify that each part of the answer choice matches the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t pick an answer that "seems correct" - verify it''s 100% correct</li>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The instant you spot anything wrong with an answer choice, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">cross it off and never read it again</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Physically cross off incorrect answers in your test booklet</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This saves time because you won''t waste effort re-reading choices you already eliminated</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you return to the question later, you''ll know which choices you''ve already ruled out</li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Process of elimination technique
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read each answer choice one at a time</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">As soon as you find something wrong, cross it out immediately</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t finish reading an answer choice once you''ve found an error in it</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Move to the next choice and repeat</li>

Benefits of Physical Elimination
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Why crossing out matters
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Saves time on time-pressured test - you won''t re-read wrong answers</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Reduces mental load - you don''t have to remember which ones you eliminated</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Helps when you''re not confident - narrowing to 2-3 choices makes guessing more effective</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Provides clarity when you return to flagged questions</li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">These three strategies work best when <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">combined systematically</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use Strategy #2 (Read Like a Lawyer) when reading the question to understand what''s being asked</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use Strategy #1 (Put Your Finger on Evidence) to locate the relevant passage section</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use Strategy #2 again when evaluating each answer choice word-by-word</li>

    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Put your finger on the evidence - there is always evidence in the passage supporting the correct answer. If you can literally point to text that matches your answer choice, you know you found the right answer. However, balance this with time management; sometimes you can''t find the evidence and need to move on.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Read like a lawyer - consider every single word carefully in both questions and answer choices. Make sure you understand exactly what the question asks, then read answer choices critically looking for any specific details that could make them incorrect. The correct answer must be 100% correct, not just "seem correct."
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. Approach #1 — The Big Read
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The simplest approach: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">read the entire passage at once</strong>, then work through the questions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read the entire passage including the short intro above it</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read to understand the passage—don''t skim</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Take 2-4 minutes (3-6 minutes for extended time) at a medium pace</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Be an active reader: move your finger/pencil along as you read, consider annotating</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
After Reading: Answering Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Strategic question approach
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Skip broad passage questions (main idea, best summarizes) and save for last</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Go back to the passage to find evidence for each question</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Follow the 30-second rule: if you can''t find evidence in 30 seconds, guess and move on</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You don''t need to answer questions in order—skip difficult ones and return later</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Who Should Use This Approach
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Best for students who:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Have strong reading comprehension</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Can read and retain information well</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Prefer understanding the big picture before diving into details</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Can finish passages with time to spare</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Approach #2 — The Big Read with Notes
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Same as Approach #1, but with <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">systematic note-taking</strong> while reading
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Take brief notes in the margin summarizing each paragraph''s main idea</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Keep notes short—just 2-5 words per paragraph</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Focus on what the paragraph is about, not every detail</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Notes help you quickly locate information when answering questions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Note-taking strategy
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: For a paragraph about sea turtle migration, write "migration patterns"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t write full sentences—waste of time</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Focus on the topic, not specific facts</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Your notes create a roadmap for finding evidence later</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">

3. Approach #3 — Label Then Read
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Skim questions first</strong> to know what to look for, then read the passage
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Quickly skim all 9 questions (don''t read answer choices yet)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Label questions with line numbers in the margin next to relevant passage text</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Then read the passage normally, already knowing what questions will ask</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When you encounter a labeled section, you know a question relates to it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
How to Label Effectively
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Labeling process
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If question #3 references lines 15-20, write "Q3" next to those lines in the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t spend time understanding the question deeply—just note where it points</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This takes 30-60 seconds but saves time finding evidence later</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You''ll know which parts of the passage are most important for questions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Who Should Use This Approach

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Approach #4 — The Speed Reader
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Read very quickly for general understanding</strong>, then use questions to guide detail-finding
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read the passage in 1-2 minutes (2-3 minutes for extended time)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Focus on understanding the main idea and passage structure</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t worry about remembering every detail</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When answering questions, return to the passage to find specific evidence</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Key Strategy Points

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">How to speed read effectively
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read the first and last sentence of each paragraph carefully</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Skim the middle sentences for the general idea</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Note where different topics are discussed (mental map of passage)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Expect to reread sections carefully when answering questions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Who Should Use This Approach
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Best for students who:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Are naturally fast readers</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Can quickly locate information in text</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Struggle with time management on Reading</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t need to read every word to understand main ideas</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
5. Approach #5 — First and Last
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Read <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">only the first and last sentence</strong> of each paragraph, then answer questions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">First sentence usually introduces the paragraph''s topic</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Last sentence often concludes or transitions to the next idea</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This gives you the passage structure in 1-2 minutes</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When answering questions, read the full relevant paragraph(s) for evidence</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
How This Approach Works
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Strategic reading process
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You''ll understand the general flow and main topics</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You won''t know specific details until you read for questions</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This approach is fastest but requires strong detail-finding skills</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Plan to read full paragraphs when answering detail questions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Who Should Use This Approach
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Best for students who:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Are extremely short on time</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Struggle to finish all passages</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Can quickly find and understand details when needed</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Are comfortable with minimal initial passage understanding</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
6. Approach #6 — Working Backwards
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Don''t read the passage first</strong>—go straight to questions and find answers in the passage
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Start with Question 1 (or any question with line numbers)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read only the relevant passage section to answer that question</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Move to the next question and repeat</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Build your understanding of the passage as you answer questions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>The Big Read (#1 and #2) works best for strong readers who can retain information: read the entire passage in 2-4 minutes, skip broad questions initially, and find evidence for each answer. Add note-taking (Approach #2) if you want a roadmap of where information appears.

    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Label Then Read (#3) and Speed Reader (#4) balance speed with comprehension: either skim questions first to know what to focus on, or read very quickly (1-2 minutes) for main ideas, then return to find detailed evidence when answering questions. Both require strong passage navigation skills.

  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>First and Last (#5) and Working Backwards (#6) are for students with severe time constraints: either read only first/last sentences of paragraphs, or skip reading entirely and answer questions by finding evidence as you go. These approaches sacrifice initial comprehension for speed but can help you finish all passages.

The Reading Test is the section students most commonly struggle to finish—you have just 40 minutes for 4 passages and 36 questions (60 minutes with extended time). Mastering pacing and learning effective time management skills is critical to ensuring you finish all passages and maximize your score.

1. Understanding Your Pacing
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">You have <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">10 minutes per passage on average</strong> (15 minutes for extended time)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Standard time: Passage 1 at 10 min, Passage 2 at 20 min, Passage 3 at 30 min, Passage 4 at 40 min</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Extended time: Passage 1 at 15 min, Passage 2 at 30 min, Passage 3 at 45 min, Passage 4 at 60 min</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These are general estimates—not every passage will take exactly the same time</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Some passages will take longer, others will go faster—this is normal</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You should never get more than 1-2 minutes behind the pace breakdown</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Check your watch at the end of each passage to assess if you''re on pace</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If on pace or ahead, keep working as you have been; if behind, pick up the pace slightly</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

2. Skills 1-3: Foundational Time Strategies
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Skill #1 - Know Your Order:</strong> Complete passages in your preferred order, not the test''s order
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Do your favorite/easiest passage type first, save the hardest for last</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you run out of time, better to rush on a passage you find challenging</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Typical order: Literary Narrative, then 3 Informational passages (Social Science, Humanities, Natural Science)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">With practice, discover which passage types you prefer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Skill #2 - Skip Broad Passage Questions:</strong> Save main idea questions for last
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The first question (sometimes first 2) often asks about the passage as a whole</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Answer these last—after answering other questions, you''ll understand the passage better</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This saves time because you won''t need to reread/skim the entire passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You''re also more likely to get these questions correct when you answer them last</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Skill #3 - Get to Know the Pace:</strong> Internalize timing so you don''t constantly check your watch
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">With practice, you''ll develop an internal sense of when you''re on/off pace</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You''ll know when you have time to dig deeper vs. when you need to move on</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Only way to achieve this: practice, practice, practice!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Skill #4 - The 30-Second Rule:</strong> Don''t spend more than 30 seconds stuck on a question
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you can''t find evidence after 30 seconds, bubble in your best guess and move on</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Better to guess on tough questions and finish the test than run out of time</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You can return to the question later if you have time or find evidence while answering others</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Skill #5 - Circle Guesses, Box Non-Confident Answers:</strong> Mark questions to revisit
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you completely guess on a question, circle the question number</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you answer but aren''t 100% confident, box the question number</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you finish early, go back to circled questions first, then boxed questions</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Better to make educated guesses and finish than get stuck and not finish</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Skill #6 - Answer Questions Out of Order:</strong> Be flexible with question sequence
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You don''t need to answer questions in the order presented</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Start with questions that have line references—easier to find quickly</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Skip questions where you can''t quickly find the relevant passage section</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">As you answer other questions, you may stumble upon evidence for skipped questions</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Questions are NOT strictly chronological in the passage</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

4. Skill 7: Finding Evidence Efficiently
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Know Where Waldo Is Likely Based on Question Number:</strong> Rough location patterns
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Questions 1-3: Start of passage, most likely in the first third (not counting broad passage questions)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Questions 4-7: Could be anywhere, but start looking in the middle of the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Questions 8-9: End of passage, most likely in the last 2 paragraphs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Important Caveat
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">These are guidelines, NOT rules
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sometimes question 8 evidence is in the middle; sometimes question 6 is in the first sentence</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you don''t find evidence in the expected location, keep looking elsewhere</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is just a method to save time by starting your search in the most likely place</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Skill #8 - Wear a Watch:</strong> Monitor timing without relying on room clocks
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Wear a watch on test day (not a smart watch; no noise)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Check your watch at the end of each passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Combined with memorized pacing, you''ll know if you''re ahead, on pace, or behind</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Adjust accordingly to ensure you finish all 4 passages</li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Skill #9 - Don''t Freak Out If Behind Pace:</strong> Manage stress when running late
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If behind pace, DON''T panic, rush excessively, or lose focus</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Make minor adjustments: read slightly faster (but maintain comprehension)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Make quicker decisions on questions—answer from memory if confident</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It''s okay to be 50-75% sure and finish, rather than guess on many questions at the end</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Panicking leads to careless mistakes and worse performance</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Skill #10 - Know When to Trust Your Gut:</strong> Balance instinct with verification
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you know the answer immediately, bubble it in and move on without checking the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you think you know but aren''t 100% confident, go back to verify</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you don''t remember the details, either find evidence or skip and return later</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Students with strong recall can rely on memory more; know your own abilities</li>
    </ul>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Many students who normally finish practice tests suddenly have timing issues on the real ACT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This happens because they stop trusting their gut on test day</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">They start finding evidence for every single question instead of answering from memory when confident</li>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Strategy for clear evidence questions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for clear, direct evidence in the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Do NOT make any inferences—this is the most common mistake!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The evidence should directly match or simply rephrase the correct answer</li>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Usually testing a word/phrase used in an uncommon way</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The correct answer is often NOT the actual definition—it''s an alternate meaning based on context</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Always contains the phrase "most nearly means"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
How to Approach
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Read for context to find the meaning
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read the sentence before, the sentence with the word, and the sentence after</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If still unclear, read more of the paragraph for additional context</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t just pick the standard dictionary definition of the word</li>

  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Two Effective Methods
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Method #1 - Pick Your Own Word: Read context, choose your own word for what it means, then find the answer choice closest to your word
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">

    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Broad passage questions ask about the passage as a whole and should be answered LAST after you''ve completed other questions and understand the full passage. Clear evidence questions (keywords: indicates, states, argues, based on) have answers that directly restate passage text—don''t make inferences on these!
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Inference questions (keywords: inferred, implies, suggests, most reasonably/likely/clearly) require you to read between the lines—the answer is demonstrated but not directly stated. The evidence still strongly supports the answer, but you must make a logical connection rather than find an exact match.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Purpose questions ask WHY information is included (keywords: purpose, serve to, in order to, function) and require reading for context beyond just the referenced lines. Main idea questions ask WHAT a section is saying (keywords: main idea, best summarizes, central claim) and focus on summarizing the specific part mentioned.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Words in context questions always say "most nearly means" and test uncommon word usage—read the sentences before, during, and after for context; the answer is often not the standard definition. Comparing passages questions (3 at end of dual text) ask you to compare both passages and can use any question type already covered.

The most important skill for ACT Reading success is effectively breaking down each question to identify exactly what you''re being asked. Most students believe they already do this, but they''re not doing it effectively enough—if you can''t articulate exactly what you''re looking for before going back to the passage, you don''t know what the ACT is asking and you''re wasting time.

1. Skill #1 — Identify the Type of Question
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When you read a question, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">first identify the question type</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You should memorize all keywords and approaches from Chapter 5 (7 question types)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Knowing the type is critical to knowing how to approach the question</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Different question types require different types of evidence in the passage</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example Question Type Identification
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Practice identifying types:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"The passage indicates that Austin had what reaction..." → Clear Evidence (keyword: indicates)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"The author discusses dual insulation in order to..." → Purpose (keyword: in order to)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"It can be inferred that the first attempt failed because..." → Inference (keyword: inferred)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"According to the passage, Terry would occasionally..." → Clear Evidence (keyword: according to)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Why This Matters
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Understanding the question type determines your strategy
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Clear evidence questions: Look for exact text that matches the answer</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Inference questions: Look for evidence that demonstrates or shows the answer</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Purpose questions: Read for context to understand WHY information is included</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Main idea questions: Focus on summarizing WHAT a section says</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Skill #2 — Identify the Keywords
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">To find evidence quickly, identify the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">keywords</strong> in the question
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Keywords are words/phrases you can skim for in the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">On the ACT, keywords from the question are almost always right near the evidence</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Keywords are like little flags saying "Look over here for the evidence!"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">After finding the keyword, use the 2-sentence rule: read 2 sentences before and 2 after</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
How to Identify Keywords
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Underline important keywords as you read the question
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Once underlined, you''ll know what words/phrases to skim for in the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Keywords help you locate the right section of the passage quickly</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The evidence is almost always near the keywords</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Examples of Keyword Identification
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example 1: "In the passage, the narrator describes a brick wall of an abandoned restaurant as:"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Keywords: "brick wall" and "abandoned restaurant"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is a clear evidence question (keyword: "in the passage")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you find where the passage discusses the brick wall of the abandoned restaurant, the answer should be right nearby and clearly match one answer choice</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Example 2: "The passage suggests that one difference between a white dwarf and a red giant is that a red giant:"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Keywords: "white dwarf" and "red giant"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is an inference question (keyword: "suggests")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for where the passage discusses both terms and find a difference between them</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The answer won''t be as clearly stated as a clear evidence question</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Primary vs. Secondary Keywords
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Understanding keyword hierarchy
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Primary keywords: The main words/phrases that will help you locate the evidence section</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Secondary keywords: Additional words that confirm you''re in the right place</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "According to the passage, compared to the temperature of a volcano undergoing an eruption, the temperature of a blue flame is:"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Primary keywords: "volcano," "eruption," "blue flame," "temperature"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You need to find where the passage compares these two temperatures</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Skill #3 — Rephrase the Question (If Necessary)
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For many questions, keywords alone are enough—<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">no need to rephrase</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Simple/short questions are usually clear enough as written</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "According to the passage, the Egyptians invented addition at the same time as:"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This question makes it very clear what you''re looking for</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Skim for "Egyptians inventing addition," find the date, check which answer choice matches</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
When to Rephrase the Question
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For more complicated questions, rephrasing helps you know exactly what to look for
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use this skill when questions are complex or challenging to break down</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you can rephrase it in your own words, you know exactly what you need from the passage</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example of When to Rephrase
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Complex question: "The narrator indicates that which of the following potential risks that doctors face while at work is a concern to her father?"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Rephrase: "What risk that doctors face is a concern for her father?"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">There''s no clear primary keyword to easily skim for</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Best primary keyword is probably "father"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">But if you just skim for "father" without clarity on what you''re looking for, you''ll have trouble finding the answer</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">By rephrasing, you know you need: risks + doctors + father''s concern</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

4. Putting It All Together
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Use all three skills systematically for <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">every question</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Identify the question type (clear evidence, inference, purpose, etc.)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Identify and underline the keywords</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: If needed, rephrase the question in your own words</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Only then should you go back to the passage to find evidence</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
The Test: Can You Articulate What You''re Looking For?
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Before going to the passage, ask yourself:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"What EXACTLY am I looking for?"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you can''t answer this precisely, you haven''t broken down the question well enough</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Go back and apply these three skills until you can articulate exactly what you need</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This prevents wasted time wandering through the passage aimlessly</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Benefits of Effective Question Breakdown
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Why mastering these skills matters:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Find evidence faster = better time management</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Know exactly what you''re looking for = higher accuracy</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Understand question types = use the right approach for each</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The better you get at breaking down questions, the easier Reading becomes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>First identify the question type using keywords from Chapter 5—this determines your approach and what type of evidence to look for. Clear evidence questions need exact text, inference questions need demonstrated evidence, purpose questions need context, and main idea questions need summaries.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Identify and underline keywords in the question—these are the words/phrases you''ll skim for in the passage. Keywords are like flags saying "evidence is here!" Use the 2-sentence rule: read 2 sentences before and 2 after the keyword location to find your evidence.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>For simple questions, keywords alone are enough—no need to rephrase. For complex questions that are challenging to break down, rephrase in your own words to clarify exactly what you''re looking for. This prevents wasting time wandering through the passage aimlessly.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Before going to the passage, ask yourself "What EXACTLY am I looking for?" If you can''t articulate this precisely, you haven''t broken down the question well enough. Apply all three skills (identify type, find keywords, rephrase if needed) to every question—the better you break down questions, the easier Reading becomes and the better your time management.

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. When to Read the Answer Choices
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">After reading the question, you can either read the answer choices right away or go back to the passage first
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The answer depends on the question type, your reading comprehension skills, and your recall of the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">There is no 100% right or wrong time to read the answer choices—it''s about finding what works for you</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Try different methods on practice passages and practice tests to discover your optimal approach</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Strategy 1: Read Answer Choices Right Away for "Which of the Following" Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For "which of the following" questions, always read the answer choices before going to the passage
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Without reading the answer choices, it''s impossible to know what you''re looking for</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Which of the following best describes the author''s view of Grier''s theory?"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The question is too broad without seeing the four specific options</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Knowing the 4 options makes it easier to find the correct answer and usually saves time</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Strategy 2: Come Up With Your Own Answer First for Purpose Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For purpose questions, go back to the passage first and come up with your own answer
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read for context and determine WHY the information is included</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Once you have your answer, look at the answer choices to see which one matches your reasoning</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If none match, you may have misunderstood—reread with the answer choices in mind</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Strategy 3: Try Your Own Answer First for Broad Passage Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">After reading the entire passage and answering all other questions, come up with your own answer
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You''ll understand the passage well by this point, so you can answer questions about the passage as a whole</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Once you have your answer, look at the choices to see which one matches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you found the passage difficult and can''t come up with your own answer, read the choices right away</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Knowing the 4 options can make it easier to find the answer or eliminate incorrect choices</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Strategy 4: Try Both Methods for Clear Evidence and Inference Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Method #1: Read answer choices right away</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You know the 4 options before going back to the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">As you read, you may recognize evidence that matches an answer choice you just read</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Helps you recognize the correct answer more quickly and can save time if you remember the answer</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">WARNING: This doesn''t work if reading the choices distracts you from knowing EXACTLY what the question asks</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Some students reread the question after reading all 4 choices to ensure they know what they''re looking for</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Method #2: Go back to the passage first</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If reading answer choices distracts you, go to the passage first and look for evidence</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Clear evidence and inference questions are usually specific, so you''ll know where to read</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">By reading before looking at choices, you''re 100% focused on answering the question</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Once you find potential evidence, read the answer choices and eliminate incorrect ones</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you can''t find evidence in 20-30 seconds, read the answer choices—they may trigger your memory</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Strategy 5: Read Answer Choices When You Don''t Have Primary Keywords
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For vague questions without primary keywords, read the answer choices right away
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The answer choices may help identify where to go or trigger your memory</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "How did the narrator''s personality affect her research?" has no clear keywords to skim for</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Reading the 4 options makes it easier to eliminate incorrect choices and know what to look for</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Strategy 6: Use Answer Choices to Help on Difficult Passages
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For passages you have trouble understanding, read the answer choices more quickly
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you read a passage and don''t understand what''s going on, let the answer choices help you</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For any questions in a difficult passage, read the answer choices right away</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: If asked about a paragraph''s main idea but you don''t understand it, read the 4 options then reread the paragraph</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Knowing the 4 options may help you recognize what the paragraph is saying</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The more you use the answer choices to help, the more you''ll understand and answer correctly</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. How to Read Answer Choices Most Effectively
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The recommended approach: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Work both forwards and backwards simultaneously</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Working forwards = looking for evidence in the passage that matches the correct answer</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Working backwards = eliminating incorrect answer choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">In an ideal world, you''d find Waldo every time by working forwards, but that''s difficult</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For some questions, it''s easier to eliminate three incorrect answers than find evidence for the correct one</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you can eliminate 3 answer choices as incorrect, you''ve found the correct answer—even without evidence</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Working Forwards — Look for Evidence in the Passage
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Put your finger on the evidence (the Waldo!) and match it to the correct answer choice
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is the ideal approach when you can clearly identify the supporting evidence</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Finding evidence that supports the correct answer for every question is difficult</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t rely solely on working forwards—combine it with working backwards</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Working Backwards — Eliminate Incorrect Answer Choices
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Anytime you see an answer choice that is incorrect for any reason, cross it off
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You''ll learn the 5 types of incorrect answer choices in Chapter 2.4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For some questions, eliminating three incorrect choices is easier than finding the evidence</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Even without finding evidence in the passage, if you eliminate 3 choices, you''ve found the correct answer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Working Forwards and Backwards Simultaneously
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">As you read each answer choice, ask yourself two questions:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Question 1 (Working Forwards):</strong> "Is there evidence in the passage that matches what this answer choice says?"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Question 2 (Working Backwards):</strong> "Is there any specific detail or strong statement in this answer choice that could make it incorrect?"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Evaluating Answer Choices
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Working forwards requires going back to the passage
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you find Waldo, you''ll know the correct answer</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If there''s no evidence to support the answer choice, it''s incorrect—cross it off</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Working backwards means looking for words that could make the answer incorrect
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Be cautious about specific details or strong statements in answer choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Stronger and more specific answer choices are usually incorrect because they can''t be supported by the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">More boring answer choices are more commonly correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The ACT knows students prefer to pick specific choices when struggling (easier to justify), so they use this as a trap</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Nobody wants to pick boring answers, but boring is usually better on ACT Reading!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Key Strategy When Stuck Between Two Answers
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">If you''re stuck between two answer choices and cannot find evidence to support either one:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Always pick the less detailed answer choice</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Boring is usually better on the ACT Reading Test</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">More specific answer choices tend to include details that go beyond what the passage supports</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">More general (boring) answer choices are safer because they''re less likely to contradict the passage</li>

Understanding what makes an answer choice correct or incorrect is one of the most important skills for Reading success. Many students feel like they''re looking for the "best" answer, but this is wrong—there is always 1 correct and 3 incorrect answer choices, and the challenge is knowing what makes the correct answer right and the incorrect answers wrong.

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. The 5 Common Types of Incorrect Answer Choices
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For success on the Reading Test, you must be able to explain what makes an answer choice incorrect
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For an answer choice to be correct, it must be supported by evidence in the passage AND answer the question being asked</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you understand not only what makes an answer correct but also what makes the others incorrect, finding the right answer becomes much easier</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The 5 most common types of incorrect answers on the ACT Reading Test are: Not in the Passage, Too Specific, Too Broad, Opposite or Slant of the Passage, and In the Passage but Not Answering the Question</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Type #1 — Not in the Passage
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Many incorrect answer choices include information that is not in the passage
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the answer choice includes details that are not in the passage, the answer is incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Could you picture the detail being true? Maybe. Could it be possible? Sure. But we don''t know it for sure from the passage.</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If we cannot point to evidence in the passage that supports an answer choice, we can only tell a story of why we think it could be true</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">As learned in Chapter 1: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">There is no storytelling!</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If an answer choice is not clearly supported by evidence in the passage, then it is always wrong</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example: Adam''s Clothing
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Passage excerpt: "Adam rolled up the tattered sleeves of his sweater, exposing the winding snake tattoos on both of his forearms... Despite now living in upstate New York, he still wore his Army boots every day, the tops of which were hidden below his faded black jeans, the only pair that he owns..."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Question: "Which of the following can be assumed about Adam''s clothing?"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">INCORRECT: "He only wears the most comfortable clothing" (not stated—we cannot point to evidence for this)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">INCORRECT: "The army provided him with free clothes" (not stated—this is storytelling)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">CORRECT: "His clothes are old and worn out" (supported by "tattered sleeves" and "faded black jeans")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">INCORRECT: "He only owns one sweater" (not stated—the passage only mentions one pair of jeans)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Type #2 — Too Specific
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Incorrect answer choices are very commonly too specific
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Often, a single word or short phrase in an answer choice makes the entire answer incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the answer choice is too specific and goes beyond what the passage says, it is always incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">As you read each answer choice, look for specific details and strong statements that could make it incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Ask yourself: "Does the passage really say that?"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Remember: The more specific and stronger an answer choice is, the more likely it will be incorrect</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example: Pelicans'' Fishing Habits
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Passage excerpt: "Pelicans'' diets include fish, amphibians, small turtles, crabs, and even other small birds... The groups of birds will form a line to drive schools of smaller fish into the shallower waters... and then scooping up their favorite prey."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Question: "Which of the following statements can be inferred from the passage?"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">INCORRECT: "Pelicans prey predominantly on fish during the summer months" (too specific—"summer months" not mentioned)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">INCORRECT: "Great White pelicans are the only species that hunt for turtles" (too specific—species not mentioned)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">CORRECT: "Small ocean fish are the main prey for pelicans" (supported by "favorite prey" referring to smaller fish)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">INCORRECT: "Pelicans do the majority of their hunting in shallow waters" (too specific—"majority" goes beyond what''s stated)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Type #3 — Too Broad
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Sometimes an answer choice is incorrect because it is too broad
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">More common: The answer choice does not specifically answer the question being asked</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Less common: The answer does not match a more specific statement made in the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">While broad answer choices are better in general, make sure your choice is always specific enough to answer the exact question asked</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example: Darwin''s Finches and Evolution
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Passage excerpt: "Dr. Anders Robert became fascinated with evolution... But he was never fully satisfied with Darwin''s explanation... Dr. Robert will travel to the Galapagos Islands to study changes in the beaks of some of the same species of finches that Darwin studied..."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Question: "The main idea of the passage is to:"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">INCORRECT: "Research the theory of evolution using Darwin''s finches" (too broad—doesn''t answer what the passage is about)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">CORRECT: "Test a new idea about evolution by studying finches'' beaks" (specific enough and captures the main idea)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">INCORRECT: "Highlight Dr. Robert''s lifelong fascination with evolution" (too broad and "lifelong" not supported)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">INCORRECT: "Recreate Darwin''s research" (word "recreate" doesn''t match—he''s testing his own new theory)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
5. Type #4 — Opposite or Slant of the Passage
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Many incorrect answers on the ACT are the opposite or a slant of what the passage states
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These answer choices often look correct because they include exact words or phrases from the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">However, they are incorrect because the answer choice is the opposite or a slant of what is in the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Do not pick an answer choice just because you find a word or phrase that is directly in the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Always make sure the answer choice is 100% correct—exact words from the passage are often in incorrect choices</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example: Ocean Currents
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Passage excerpt: "As water freezes in the North and South Poles, the water surrounding the ice becomes saltier and colder... The cold, salty water sinks due to its increased density... it travels southward to spread across the submerged surface of the earth... Warm water replaces it on the surface and moves to the north."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Question: "Which statement about the global conveyor belt is best supported by the passage?"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">INCORRECT: "Cold, salty water comes to the surface" (opposite—passage says it sinks)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">INCORRECT: "The currents change with the seasons" (not in the passage)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">INCORRECT: "Melting ice is the first step" (opposite—passage says freezing water, not melting ice)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">CORRECT: "Cold, salty water travels south on the ocean floor and warm water moves north on the surface" (matches passage)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
6. Type #5 — In the Passage but Not Answering the Question
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">This final type of incorrect answer is often the most difficult to avoid
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These are answer choices that are directly stated in the passage but do not answer the question being asked</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You will be able to go to the passage, find the information, and match it with the answer choice</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">However, it will still be incorrect because it doesn''t answer what the question is asking!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Two Critical Reminders
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Reminder #1:</strong> Do not select an answer choice because it has a word or phrase that matches the passage
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Make sure the answer choice is 100% correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The ACT will often put exact words or phrases from the passage in incorrect answer choices to try to trick you</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Reminder #2:</strong> Finding evidence for an answer choice in the passage does not mean you found the correct answer
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You still need to make sure you are answering the question the ACT is asking</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Evidence in the passage + answering the question = correct answer</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Evidence in the passage alone ≠ correct answer (if it doesn''t answer the question)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Key Takeaways
</h3>

<ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Type #1 (Not in the Passage): If an answer choice includes details not in the passage, it''s incorrect—no matter how possible or logical it seems. There is no storytelling! If you can''t point to evidence in the passage that clearly supports an answer choice, it''s always wrong.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Type #2 (Too Specific) and Type #3 (Too Broad): Look for specific details and strong statements that could make an answer incorrect—often a single word makes the entire choice wrong. The more specific and stronger an answer is, the more likely it''s incorrect. However, make sure your answer choice is still specific enough to answer the exact question being asked.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Type #4 (Opposite or Slant): Don''t pick an answer just because it contains exact words or phrases from the passage—the ACT often puts passage words in incorrect choices. These answers are the opposite or a slant of what the passage actually says. Always verify the answer choice is 100% correct, not just that it contains familiar words.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Type #5 (In the Passage but Not Answering the Question): The most difficult type to avoid—these answers are directly stated in the passage and you can find evidence for them, but they still don''t answer the question being asked. Finding evidence in the passage doesn''t mean you found the correct answer; you must also answer the exact question the ACT is asking.

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Words in context questions ask you to select what a word or phrase "most nearly means" in the context of the passage. Usually, you''re determining the meaning of a word or phrase used in an unusual or uncommon way, and the correct answer is not the actual definition of the word but instead an alternate meaning based on the context.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. How to Identify Words in Context Questions
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Words in context questions always have the phrase <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"most nearly means"</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "As used in line 9, ''critical'' most nearly means:"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The question will specify the exact line number where the word or phrase appears</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Answer choices typically provide 4 different possible meanings of the word</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Finding the Correct Answer
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">To find the correct answer, you must read for context
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read the sentence before, the sentence the word or phrase is in, and the following sentence</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you''re still not clear on what the word or phrase means, read for more context—as much as you need</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The surrounding text will help you understand how the word is being used in this specific instance</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Method #1 — Pick Your Own Word
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Read for context
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read at least 1 sentence before and after the word or phrase in the question</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read more if necessary to understand the context</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Pick your own word(s) to replace the word or phrase in the question
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Write your word(s) down to keep track of your thinking</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you''re having trouble picking a specific word, try to pick a tone instead</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Decide if the tone of the word or phrase is positive, negative, or neutral based on the surrounding text</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Look at the answer choices and pick the one that best matches
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Compare each answer choice to your word(s) or tone</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Select the answer that most closely matches what you came up with</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Method #2 — Read the Answer Choices Back in the Passage
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Read each answer choice back in the passage
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Substitute each answer choice in place of the word in the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Make sure to still read for context when you plug in each answer choice</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t just read the single sentence—read the surrounding sentences too</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Pick the answer choice that best replaces the word in the passage
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The correct answer will fit naturally in the context of the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both approaches are equally effective, so which one you use is a matter of preference</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Tip #1 — Do Not Assume the Hard Vocabulary Word is Correct
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Words in context questions are one place the ACT commonly tests vocabulary knowledge
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you see any word(s) that you do not know, do not assume the hard word is correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Many students mistakenly think: "Oh, this is the ACT...it must be the hard word since they''re testing my vocabulary"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Wrong! Sometimes the ACT is testing your vocabulary and the hard word is correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Other times, the hard word is just a decoy and a simpler word that you know fits correctly</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
5. Tip #2 — Do Not Pick the Answer Choice That Defines the Word
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The correct answer is rarely the definition of the word
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Most commonly, the word or phrase in the passage is used in an uncommon or unusual way that differs from the definition</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The ACT is testing whether you can understand the word based on context, not just whether you know the definition</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">However, this is not always the case—sometimes the correct answer is the definition</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This occurs most commonly for hard vocabulary words where the ACT is genuinely testing if you know the word</li>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">On words in context questions, do the best you can with the words you know
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If there is a word you know and it works, pick that word</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you know a word and it does not work, cross it off</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you''re stuck between two words that you do not know, bubble in your best guess and move on</li>

    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Words in context questions always have the phrase "most nearly means" and ask you to determine what a word or phrase means based on how it''s used in the passage. The correct answer is usually not the actual definition but an alternate meaning based on context, so you must read the sentence before, the sentence with the word, and the sentence after (or more if needed).
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Two effective methods: Method #1 is to read for context, pick your own word (or tone: positive/negative/neutral), then find the answer choice that best matches. Method #2 is to read each answer choice back into the passage with context and pick the one that fits best. Both approaches are equally effective—use whichever you prefer.

Also, do not automatically pick the answer choice that defines the word, since the ACT usually tests uncommon uses of words rather than standard definitions (though definitions are correct for hard vocabulary words).

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Each ACT has 1 dual text passage with two short passages (Passage A and Passage B) that discuss similar topics and are somehow related. At the end, there are always 3 comparing passages questions that ask about both passages—this chapter teaches you how to approach these questions effectively.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. Understanding Dual Text Passages
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Dual text passages include two short passages labeled as Passage A and Passage B
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The two passages discuss similar topics and are somehow related</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Two scientists offering differing opinions on a recent discovery</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Questions always go in this order: Passage A Questions → Passage B Questions → Comparing Passages Questions (3 questions)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
How to Approach Dual Text Passages
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Recommended approach:</strong> Read each passage separately—do not read both passages before starting the questions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Read Passage A and answer questions for Passage A</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Read Passage B and answer questions for Passage B</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Answer Comparing Passages Questions</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Since the passages are shorter, most students find it easier to read the entire passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Still apply whatever method you prefer from the ones discussed in Chapter 1.3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">If you work backwards:</strong> Answer questions for Passage A, then Passage B, then Comparing Passages Questions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use the questions to guide your reading of each passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Still save the Comparing Passages Questions for last</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Identifying Comparing Passages Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Comparing passages questions are always the last 3 questions in the dual text passage
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Which of the following statements best captures the main difference in the purposes of the two passages?"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Which of the following statements about instruments is most strongly supported by details provided in Passage A and Passage B?"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The ACT will have a box telling you that the question asks about both passages</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">To answer correctly, you must use information from both passages</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Tip #1 — Read the Answer Choices Right Away
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Comparing passages questions are generally quite broad, so you should always read the answer choices right away
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Once you''ve read the answer choices and know what the 4 options are, it''s much easier to accomplish two things:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">(1) Eliminate any answer choices that are clearly incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">(2) Know what to look for in Passage A and Passage B</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Without reading the answer choices first, you may waste time searching aimlessly through both passages</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Tip #2 — Work Backwards More Actively with the Answer Choices
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Comparing passages questions generally have longer answer choices because the answer choice must refer to information in both passages
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When you see longer answer choices, work backwards more actively</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for specific details that do not match the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Often, multiple answer choices are partly correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It''s easier to look for what is incorrect about each answer choice rather than focusing on which seems most correct</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example Strategy
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Question: "The primary purpose of both passages is to:"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A. resolve a long-standing debate on the evolution of vampire bats</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">B. celebrate the findings of recent research by Brazilian scientists</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">C. present two competing theories on the development of echolocation in vampire bats</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">D. catalog evidence from multiple studies that supports a finding about vampire bats</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">We need to pick an answer that matches both passages
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Rather than looking for the correct answer, it''s easier to eliminate choices that don''t match one passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If Passage A only presents one theory about echolocation, C is incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If Passage B discusses a debate but doesn''t resolve it, A is incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Working backwards with this thinking makes finding the correct answer easier</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Tip #3 — Beware of Half-Right Answer Choices
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For comparing passages questions, the ACT loves writing answer choices that are halfway correct
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Part of the answer choice perfectly answers the question</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">However, there is something wrong with the remaining portion of the answer choice</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Students often pick these incorrect choices because they get excited over the part that''s correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">They don''t read the rest of the answer choice carefully enough</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">As always, we need to be very picky when assessing each answer choice—especially for comparing passages questions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example of Half-Right Answer Choices
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Question: "Which choice best states the relationship between the two passages?"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A. Passage A provides an overview of a scientific discovery, while Passage B summarizes the experiments that led to that discovery</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">B. Passage A summarizes a scientific finding, while Passage B focuses on the potential applications of that finding</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">C. Passage A presents conflicting points of view on an issue, while Passage B presents evidence supporting a single view on that issue</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">D. Passage A considers how to best test two hypotheses, while Passage B argues that only one of the hypotheses is valid</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Notice how the first half of A and B are both very similar
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These could both accurately describe Passage A, but only one can be correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This means one of these answer choices must be half-right</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It''s important to focus on the second half of the answer choices to determine which is correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">As always, the correct answer must be 100% correct!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
5. Tip #4 — Do Not Focus on the Identical Parts of the Answer Choices
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Many comparing passages questions have portions of multiple answer choices that are identical
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When you see identical parts in the answer choices, do not focus on the similarities</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Instead, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">focus on the differences</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Students make the mistake of trying to figure out which identical part is more correct, which is often impossible</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You should focus on the differences in the rest of the answer choice—this is what actually determines which is correct</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example of Identical Parts
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Question: "How do the two passages differ in the attitudes of each author towards women serving in the army?"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A. Smith implies that women should be prevented from serving in the army, whereas Jones supports women serving in the army in non-combat roles</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">B. Smith believes that women with certain physical abilities can be considered for service in the army, whereas Jones assumes that physical ability is unrelated to any person''s ability to serve</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">C. Smith argues that service should be a personal choice regardless of gender, whereas Jones contends that women are unsuitable to serve due to emotional instability</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">D. Smith asserts that anyone who can serve in the army should be able to do so, whereas Jones argues that men and women should serve in gender-specific roles</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The first half of C and D are both saying the same thing: anyone should be able to serve
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If Smith argues that in Passage A, there''s no way to tell if C or D is correct by focusing on the first half alone</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Instead, we need to look at the rest of the answer choices and focus on the differences</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Similarly, the second half of A and D are making almost identical statements
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both say men and women should have separate roles in the army</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If Jones argued that in Passage B, don''t focus on determining which is more correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Instead, look at the first half of those answer choices and focus on the differences to find which is correct</li>

Working backwards means going straight to the questions without reading the entire passage first—it''s not recommended for all students, but it may help you improve your score if you struggle with time management or recall. All students should know how to work backwards in case you mess up pacing and need to use it on the final passage on test day.

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You can finish in time with the Big Read, Big Read with Notes, or Label then Read—reading the entire passage will likely help you score higher</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You''re aiming for 32-36 (can only miss 0-3 questions)—if you never read the passage, you''re more likely to get questions wrong because you didn''t find the correct evidence (though some students have scored perfectly working backwards, so it depends on you)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
How to Tell If Working Backwards Is for You
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The best way to see if working backwards helps you is to try it on practice passages and practice tests
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If it sounds like it might help you, try it out—you may find it improves your score, or you may hate it</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Working backwards takes lots of practice to master since it''s somewhat chaotic and requires thinking on the fly</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. General Steps for Working Backwards
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Working backwards requires answering questions out of order, making quick decisions, knowing when to give up and move on, and thinking on the fly
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is a general recommendation, not an exact order—don''t feel you must stick to the exact sequence</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The approach will vary based on the question types and your own reading/skimming skills</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 1: Go Straight to the Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Go straight to the questions before reading the passage
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You will never read the entire passage when working backwards</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Instead, you''ll read only the parts of the passage needed to answer specific questions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 2: Skip Broad Passage Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Skip any broad passage questions that ask about the entire passage—save those for last
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You need to understand the whole passage to answer these, which you won''t have yet</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Answer these at the very end after you''ve read parts of the passage for other questions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 3: Skip Questions Requiring Multiple Parts of the Passage
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Skip questions that require reading various parts of the passage—save those for later
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Chronological order questions: "Which of the following events occurs in the passage first chronologically?"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Questions requiring various details: "The author would most likely agree with which of the following statements?"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Vague questions with no good keywords to skim for: "As summarized in the passage, the study focuses primarily on:"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 4: Start with Line Reference and Paragraph Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Start with line reference questions or questions that reference a specific paragraph
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "The main idea of the third paragraph..."</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Other easy questions: words in context questions</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use the 2-sentence rule for these questions and read for more context if necessary</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 5: Answer Clear Evidence Questions with Strong Keywords
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Next, look for clear evidence questions with strong primary keywords
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for capitalized words, numbers, other unique keywords that are easier to find in the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for clear evidence questions with shorter answer choices, as these are often easier to find and faster to answer</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Skip clear evidence questions with weak keywords and save those for later (unless you already know where to find the evidence)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 6: Answer Inference Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Next, answer inference questions—start with those with strong primary keywords
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Skip inference questions with weak keywords and save for later (unless you already know where to go)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use the answer choices more actively—for inference questions the Waldo won''t be as clear</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Knowing the 4 options makes it easier and faster to find evidence, eliminate incorrect choices, and answer correctly</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 7: Handle Purpose Questions Based on Keywords
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Purpose questions are generally best saved for later, but it depends on the keywords
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If a purpose question has line references, you can usually answer right away—read for enough context</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If a purpose question has strong primary keyword, go look for it, read for context, and answer (if you can''t find keyword in 30 seconds, move on)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If a purpose question is vague and/or you don''t have strong keyword(s), skip and save for later</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Regardless of keywords, if you know where to go in the passage, answer it (as long as you have enough context)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Step 8: Answer Skipped Questions Last
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Answer the broad passage questions or any other questions you''ve skipped last
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you''re running out of time, answer the broad passage questions using the information you know about the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Answer broad passage questions before other skipped questions if time is limited</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Answer Right Away vs. Save for Later?
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">One essential skill for working backwards is learning when to answer a question right away vs. skip and save for later
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Learning this skill takes lots of practice—there''s no simple set of rules to follow</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Every question is a judgment call that depends on: the wording, the keywords (or lack thereof), the parts of the passage you''ve read so far, and the answer choices</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Line Reference Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Always answer line reference questions right away
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Since these questions tell you where to go, you never need to search</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read for context and answer the question</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Take time to read for enough context to answer correctly—you can (and often should) read more than 2 sentences before and after</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Clear Evidence Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Usually easier to answer right away, but it depends on keyword strength and answer choices
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Answer right away: Clear evidence questions with strong primary keyword(s) (like "Jupiter," "Amsterdam," specific names/places)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Save for later: Questions without strong primary keywords or with answer choices that may be scattered throughout the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use your best judgment based on what you''ve read—if you have good keywords or already know where to go, answer right away</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Always follow the 30-second rule—don''t get stuck on these for too long</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Inference Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Inference questions are usually saved for later, but it depends on keyword strength and answer choices
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">In general, you should almost always look at the answer choices for inference questions right away</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Answer right away: Inference questions with very strong, specific keywords that are easy to find</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Save for later: Inference questions without strong keywords or that require broader passage understanding</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Work backwards if you can''t finish in time, don''t recall what you read, or timing (not comprehension) is your biggest issue. Don''t work backwards if you can finish with other methods or are aiming for 32-36 (though some students score perfectly working backwards). All students should know how to work backwards in case you mess up pacing and have less than 4 minutes for the final passage.

This is a general guide—don''t feel you must stick to the exact order.

    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Always answer line reference questions right away since they tell you where to go. For clear evidence questions: answer right away if you have strong keywords (capitalized words, numbers, unique keywords), save for later if keywords are weak or answer choices may be scattered. For inference questions: usually save for later, but always read the answer choices right away.

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. Tip #1 — Keep it Moving
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Time management is critical for success on the Reading Test
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You have 9 minutes per passage for normal time and 15 minutes per passage for extended time</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">To finish all 4 passages consistently, it''s important to know when to guess and move on to the next question</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">In general, never spend more than 1 minute on any single question (1.5 minutes for extended time)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Developing Time Management
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">At first, it may be hard to manage time and know when to move on
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You''ll get a better sense of time management as you complete practice ACTs</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">With practice, you''ll develop a voice in your head saying "It''s time to bubble in your best guess and move on"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is especially true on the first 4-6 questions of each passage—follow the 30-second rule!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you can''t find the correct part of the passage quickly, circle the question number and move on</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You may come across the evidence as you answer questions in the rest of the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You can always go back and change your answer if you find the evidence later</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Knowing when to move on will increase your score
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">We know it feels weird moving on without being confident in your answer choice</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">But moving on allows you to answer more questions and avoid guessing as time runs out</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Tip #2 — Circle Guesses; Box Non-Confident Answers
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Circle guesses:</strong> Whenever you guess on a question, circle the question number on your test
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you finish with time left, go back to the circled questions you guessed on</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Spend more time looking for the Waldo</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The question may also seem easier when you come back to it a second time</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Box non-confident answers:</strong> If you''re not confident in your answer, box the question number on your test
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you have time left after going back to circled questions, you can look over these boxed questions again</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Only change your answer if you have a very good reason—you''re usually correct on your first attempt</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">However, if you realize you misread the question, didn''t notice a detail in the passage, or notice something that makes your answer choice incorrect, change your answer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Tip #3 — Never Worry About Patterns in the Answer Choices
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">"I bubbled in A and F for the last 4 questions. There is no way this one can be A again, right??" WRONG!
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When answering a question, only focus on that question</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Never let any pattern in the answer choices affect which answer choice you pick</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sometimes, the same spot on the scantron sheet is correct 4 or even 5 times in a row on the ACT</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It''s also possible that you answered one of the previous questions incorrectly, and there aren''t supposed to be 4 or 5 in a row</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">There''s no way for you to know on test day, so just focus on selecting what you think is correct for each question</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Tip #4 — Boring is Better
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Boring answer choices are usually better on the ACT
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you''re ever between two answer choices, always pick the more boring answer choice</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The more specific an answer choice is, the more likely something in that answer choice is incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Remember: An answer choice must be 100% correct to be correct</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Why We Pick Specific Answer Choices (and Why We Shouldn''t)
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The challenge is that we don''t like to pick boring answer choices, especially on challenging questions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">An answer choice with more details is much easier to come up with a story as to why the answer could be correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This makes you feel better bubbling it in</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Your job is to pick the answer choice that is supported by the passage, not the one that feels best to you</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">So again, when you''re between two answer choices, pick the boring one with fewer details</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
5. Tip #5 — Beware of Keyword Matching
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Anytime you see words in an answer choice that directly match words from the passage, proceed with caution
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Make sure the entire answer choice is correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Matching keywords may be in the correct answer choice, but they can also be in incorrect answer choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These incorrect choices are often half-truths, where part of the answer choice perfectly matches the passage but another part is incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Students often mistakenly pick these incorrect answer choices because the keywords match</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Never just match keywords—always make sure the answer choice you select is 100% correct</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

6. Tip #6 — Do Not Over-Annotate
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Some students annotate a lot. Others make no annotations at all. There is no right or wrong way to annotate.
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You need to find what works best for you</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">What''s most important is to make sure that annotating is helping you better understand the passage and work through the questions more efficiently</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you''re underlining 50% of the passage, those are not helpful annotations</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you''re writing down notes after each paragraph but never use those notes, you''re wasting time</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
What Good Annotations Should Do
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Proper annotations should help you:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Maintain focus as you read</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Increase your comprehension of what you read</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Know where in the passage to go when working through the questions</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">There is no best way to annotate for everyone—how much you annotate and what types of annotations you use varies from student to student</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">On practice ACTs, try different methods for annotation and find what works best for you</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

7. Tip #7 — Make the Most of Practice ACTs
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Practice ACTs are the best way to improve on the Reading Test...if you''re using and reviewing them properly
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Here are some tips for how to make the most of your practice ACTs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Always Time Practice ACTs Strictly
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Never give yourself extra time to finish the section and see how you would have scored
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It will give you false confidence for how much you''re improving</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Strict timing is essential to building the time management skills you need on test day</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Review Your Mistakes Thoroughly
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Whenever you answer a question incorrectly, go back to the passage and find the evidence for the correct answer
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Make sure you identify why your answer choice was incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It is critical to learn from every single mistake you make to continuously improve</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Be Obsessive About Improving
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Students who improve the most on the Reading Test are the ones who are most obsessive about learning from their mistakes
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">After each question, try to figure out why you missed the question</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Did you not read the question carefully enough?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Were you answering your own question and not exactly what the ACT was asking you?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Did you not recognize the type of question?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Once you figure out why you made the mistake, think about how you can avoid the mistake in the future</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If necessary, go review any topic(s) from the chapters we have already covered</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

Key Takeaways

    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Keep it moving—never spend more than 1 minute on any single question (1.5 for extended time). Follow the 30-second rule on the first 4-6 questions, and if you can''t find the right part of the passage quickly, circle the question number and move on. Knowing when to move on increases your score by allowing you to answer more questions and avoid guessing as time runs out.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Circle guesses and box non-confident answers—if you finish with time, go back to circled questions first, then boxed questions. Never worry about patterns in answer choices (the same letter can be correct 4-5 times in a row). Only change answers if you have a very good reason—you''re usually correct on your first attempt.
  </li>

The more specific an answer choice is, the more likely something in it is incorrect. Beware of keyword matching—just because an answer choice has matching keywords doesn''t mean it''s correct; these are often half-truths where part matches but another part is incorrect.

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Complete passages one at a time and review immediately</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Complete these passages 1 at a time and watch the video explanation right after you complete each passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Right after you complete the passage, you''ll remember exactly what you were thinking as you answered each question</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">As you watch the video explanation, you can identify exactly what you did correctly, where you made mistakes in your thinking, and how you can improve on the next passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you complete a bunch of passages in a row or watch the video explanation much later, you will not learn as effectively</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A variety of approaches were discussed in Chapter 1.3 (now is a good time to review that chapter if you don''t remember the details!)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you''re not sure what approach is best for you, try different approaches on different passages</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Once you find your favorite approach, stick with that approach for the rest of your practice passages and practice ACTs to perfect it</li>
    </ul>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You have 10 minutes per passage (15 minutes with extended time), but you can take more time on these passages</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Your goal on these passages is to try your best to answer all the questions correctly</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Focus on applying what you''ve learned</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you need to take a bit more time to do so at first, that''s fine! Don''t worry about pacing yet</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You will learn to work more quickly as you improve your Reading skills</li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Review any topic(s) that you need to before going to the next practice passage
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Students who improve the most are the ones who are the most obsessive about learning from their mistakes</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">After each passage, try to identify why you missed the questions that you answered incorrectly</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If there are any topics from the course that you need to review, go back and review before working on the next practice passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For example, if you notice you''re struggling on spotting the different question types, go back to Chapter 2.1</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This course has covered tons of information in a short period of time, so a quick review can be effective to help you continue to improve</li>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Do your best and use the video explanations to learn how to improve your skills</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You will not immediately start answering all questions correctly</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It''s a journey to get to the score you want</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Your goal is to get a little bit better with each passage</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

This means you have approximately 52.5 seconds per question, but in practice, you need to account for the time required to read and understand passages, study figures</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">analyze data. The strict time limit makes the Science section one of the most time-pressured parts of the ACT. Many students report that their biggest challenge is finishing all passages within the allotted time, which is why developing efficient reading and data analysis strategies is crucial.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> The Three Passage Types </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Data Representation:</strong> (2-3 passages with 5 questions each)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Research Summaries:</strong> (3-4 passages with 6 questions each), and</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Conflicting Viewpoints:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">(1 passage with 7 questions). Data Representation passages present scientific information through graphs</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">and diagrams with minimal text</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">testing your ability to extract and analyze data. Research Summaries passages describe one or more experiments</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">testing your understanding of experimental design</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">results. Conflicting Viewpoints passages present two or more scientists or students discussing different hypotheses or theories about the same phenomenon, testing your ability to compare and contrast scientific perspectives. Recognizing these passage types immediately helps you adjust your reading strategy and know what to expect.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Content Areas Covered </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Earth/space sciences:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">. Topics might include genetics, ecology, chemical reactions, atomic structure, motion and forces, electricity, geology, meteorology, astronomy, and more. However, the ACT does not expect you to have memorized extensive science content</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">nearly all information needed to answer questions is provided in the passage itself. The section primarily tests your ability to interpret data, understand experimental methods</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">apply basic scientific reasoning rather than recall specific facts. That said, having a general familiarity with basic science concepts (like understanding what pH measures, knowing that temperature affects reaction rates, or recognizing common scientific units) can help you work more efficiently.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Scoring and Performance Expectations </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">raw score:</strong> (0-40), which is then converted to a</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">scaled score: from 1-36. The conversion table varies slightly from test to test to account for difficulty differences</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">generally, missing 2-3 questions can still yield a score in the 33-35 range, while missing 6-8 questions typically results in a score around 28-30. There is</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">no penalty for wrong answers: so you should always guess if you''re running out of time. The Science section is often considered one of the most improvable sections of the ACT because success depends more on test-taking strategies and data interpretation skills than on extensive content knowledge</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Students who initially struggle with timing often see significant score improvements after learning efficient passage navigation techniques and question-answering strategies.</li></ul> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Example: Section Breakdown Typical Science section structure: - Data Representation passages: 2-3 passages × 5 questions = 10-15 questions - Research Summaries passages: 3-4 passages × 6 questions = 18-24 questions - Conflicting Viewpoints passage: 1 passage × 7 questions = 7 questions Total: 6-7 passages with 40 questions in 35 minutes. Recommended pacing: 5 minutes per passage, with flexibility to spend more time on complex passages and less on straightforward ones.</p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 2. What the Science Section Actually Tests </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Despite its name, the ACT Science section is better understood as a scientific reasoning test rather than a traditional science knowledge test. The section assesses three main skill categories: Interpretation of Data, Scientific Investigation, and Evaluation of Models, Inferences, and Experimental Results.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Understanding these skill categories helps you recognize what each question is asking and how to approach it strategically.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Interpretation of Data (40-50% of questions) </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Interpretation of Data questions test your ability to read graphs and tables, identify trends, extract specific values, and interpolate or extrapolate data. You might be asked to determine what temperature corresponds to a specific pressure value from a graph, identify whether two variables have a positive or inverse relationship, or predict what would happen if an experiment continued beyond the data shown.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">These questions require careful attention to axis labels, units, scales, and legends. Common question stems include:.</p><ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">"According to Figure 1, what was the pH when temperature was 40°C?", "Based on Table 2, as concentration increased</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">reaction rate:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">or "If the experiment had continued</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">the mass at 60 seconds would most likely have been:"</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Success on these questions comes from methodically reading data representations and avoiding careless errors like misreading scales or confusing which variable is which</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Scientific Investigation (20-30% of questions) </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Scientific Investigation:</strong> questions test your understanding of</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">scientific methodology:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">. You need to identify which variables were manipulated (independent variables)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">which were measured (dependent variables)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">which were held constant (control variables)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">and what the purpose of specific experimental procedures was. Questions might ask: "Which variable was directly manipulated by the researchers?"</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">"What was the purpose of Trial 1?", "Which of the following would be the best way to extend this experiment?", or "What hypothesis was being tested in Experiment 2?" These questions assess whether you understand how scientific experiments are structured and how scientists test hypotheses systematically. Strong performance requires understanding the logic behind experimental design and recognizing the difference between correlation and causation.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Evaluation of Models, Inferences, and Experimental Results (30-40% of questions) </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Evaluation:</strong> questions test your ability to</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">evaluate whether evidence supports a hypothesis:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">. These questions require higher-order thinking and often involve synthesizing information from multiple sources within a passage. You might be asked: "Based on the results of Experiments 1 and 2</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">which conclusion is best supported?"</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">"Which hypothesis is consistent with the data in Table 3?"</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">"Student 1 would most likely agree with which statement?"</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">or "What additional information would help determine which theory is correct?" These questions are typically more challenging because they require you to go beyond simply reading data and instead think critically about what the data means, what assumptions underlie different viewpoints, and what logical conclusions can be drawn. Success requires careful reasoning and avoiding common pitfalls like choosing answers that sound plausible but aren''t actually supported by the passage.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> The Minimal Role of Outside Knowledge </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">One of the most important things to understand about the ACT Science section is that it requires minimal outside content knowledge.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">The vast majority of questions can be answered using only the information provided in the passage, figures, and tables. You might encounter 1-3 questions per test that require basic scientific knowledge (such as knowing that water boils at 100°C at standard pressure, understanding that photosynthesis produces oxygen, or recognizing common lab equipment), but these represent a very small percentage of total questions.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">In fact, trying to apply outside knowledge can sometimes lead you astray if you make assumptions that contradict the passage''s specific setup.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">The best approach is to trust the passage and base your answers on what is explicitly stated or clearly implied by the data.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Students with limited science coursework can still achieve excellent scores by focusing on data interpretation and reasoning skills rather than worrying about content gaps..</li></ul> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Example: Skill Category Breakdown In a typical 40-question Science section: - 16-20 questions test Interpretation of Data (reading graphs, identifying trends, extracting values) - 8-12 questions test Scientific Investigation (experimental design, variables, controls) - 12-16 questions test Evaluation (drawing conclusions, analyzing viewpoints, making inferences) Knowing this distribution helps you understand where to focus your practice and what skills matter most for a high score. The majority of questions test data interpretation and evaluation skills rather than memorized science facts.</p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 3. Common Misconceptions About the Science Section </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Many students approach the Science section with incorrect assumptions that hinder their performance. Understanding and correcting these misconceptions is crucial for developing an effective strategy and avoiding common pitfalls that prevent students from reaching their scoring potential.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Misconception #1: You Need Extensive Science Knowledge </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">scientific reasoning and data interpretation skills:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">not memorized content. Students who have taken Advanced Placement science courses don''t necessarily score higher than students with basic science coursework if they haven''t developed strong graph-reading and analytical skills. The passage provides all necessary context</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">definitions</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">and background information. Your job is to</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">apply logical reasoning:</strong> not recall obscure scientific facts. In fact, overthinking questions by trying to apply outside knowledge often leads students to incorrect answers when they should simply trust what the passage explicitly states. Focus on developing strong data analysis skills rather than cramming science content.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Misconception #2: You Must Read Every Word of Text </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">strategic skimming approach:</strong> quickly reading the introduction to understand the general topic, focusing primarily on</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">figures and tables: and only reading detailed text when needed to answer specific questions. The figures often contain the most important information</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">paragraphs of text frequently just explain procedures in more detail than necessary. Learning to</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">prioritize visual data:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">over lengthy descriptions can save significant time. However, this doesn''t mean ignoring text entirely</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">you need to read enough to understand what was studied and what the variables represent, but you don''t need to memorize every procedural detail</li></ul></li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Misconception #3: Harder Science Topics Mean Harder Questions </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Students often feel intimidated when they see passages about unfamiliar or complex-sounding topics like "polymerase chain reaction" or "superconductivity." However, passage topic complexity does not correlate with question difficulty. A passage about a sophisticated physics concept might have straightforward questions that simply ask you to read values from a graph, while a passage about a simple experiment with plants might have challenging questions that require synthesizing information from multiple trials.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The ACT deliberately uses technical-sounding topics to test whether you can stay focused and confident when faced with unfamiliar material. Don''t let intimidating vocabulary or advanced-sounding topics psyche you out.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The questions are designed to be answerable regardless of your prior knowledge of the specific topic. Stay calm, focus on the data, and trust that all necessary information is provided.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Misconception #4: The Passages Must Be Completed in Order </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Many students assume they must work through Science passages in the order they appear, but this is not a requirement. In fact, strategic passage selection can improve both your score and confidence.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Some students find Data Representation passages faster and easier because they focus primarily on graphs with minimal text, so they tackle those first to bank time for more complex passages. Others prefer starting with Research Summaries because they find the experimental format more intuitive.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Still others save the Conflicting Viewpoints passage for last because it has the most text and different question types. You can also preview passages quickly and identify which ones look most straightforward based on figure complexity and text length.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Experiment during practice to find an order that maximizes your efficiency. Just be careful to bubble answers in the correct spots on your answer sheet when you skip around.</p> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Example: Correcting Misconceptions in Practice Before: "I need to read every word carefully and I''m worried because I haven''t taken AP Chemistry yet." After: "I''ll focus primarily on the figures and tables, skim the text for context, and trust that all information I need is in the passage. My score depends on data interpretation skills, not memorized content." This mindset shift alone can lead to significant time savings and reduced anxiety, allowing you to work more efficiently and confidently through Science passages.</p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 4. Building Your Science Section Foundation </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Success on the ACT Science section requires developing a systematic approach that combines efficient passage navigation, strong data interpretation skills, strategic time management, and focused practice. This section introduces foundational concepts and habits that will support your improvement across all Science question types.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Developing a Passage Attack Strategy </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">quickly reading the introduction to understand what phenomenon or question is being studied</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">examining all figures and tables to understand what variables are being measured and what trends are visible</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">skimming any experimental descriptions to identify how trials differ from each other, and</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">moving to the questions, referring back to specific parts of the passage as needed.</li></ul>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">This approach prioritizes the most important information (the data itself) while avoiding getting bogged down in procedural details. However, you should experiment with variations during practice to find what works best for your reading style and strengths.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Some students prefer reading questions first to know what to look for, while others find this disruptive. Find your optimal approach through deliberate practice.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Mastering Figure and Table Analysis </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">graphs, tables, and diagrams:</strong> developing strong figure-reading skills is essential. When you look at any figure, immediately identify: (1) what</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">variables:</strong> are being shown (check axis labels and table headers), (2) what</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">units:</strong> are being used (meters, seconds, grams, etc.), (3) what</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">scale:</strong> is being used (does the axis start at zero or some other value?), (4) what</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">relationships or trends:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">are visible (do values increase</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">or stay constant?)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">and (5) what different</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">lines or symbols: represent (check the legend). Practice reading figures actively by asking yourself these questions for every graph or table you encounter</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Also train yourself to spot common pitfalls like logarithmic scales, multiple y-axes, or unusual units that could cause misinterpretation.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Understanding Variables and Experimental Design Basics </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">independent variables:</strong> (what the researcher changes)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">dependent variables:</strong> (what the researcher measures), and</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">control variables:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">(what the researcher keeps the same). For example</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">if an experiment tests how different fertilizers affect plant growth</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">the fertilizer type is the independent variable</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">plant height is the dependent variable</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">factors like water amount, sunlight, and temperature should be control variables. You should also understand why scientists run</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">control groups:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">(to provide a baseline for comparison)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">why they repeat trials multiple times (to ensure results are reliable and not due to chance)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">and how to distinguish between</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">correlation and causation:</strong> . These fundamental concepts appear repeatedly across Science passages.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Time Management and Practice Strategies </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Improving your Science score requires deliberate practice with a focus on both accuracy and speed</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Start by working on individual passages untimed to ensure you understand how to analyze data and answer questions correctly.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Once your accuracy is consistently high (80%+ correct), begin adding time pressure by setting a 5-minute timer per passage</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Track which passage types and question types give you the most trouble, and dedicate extra practice to those areas.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">When reviewing practice questions, don''t just check whether you got them right or wrong—carefully review the reasoning behind each answer</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">figure out why wrong answers are incorrect, and identify what clues in the passage you should have noticed.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Also practice on full-length Science sections to build stamina and ensure your strategy works under realistic testing conditions</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Many students find that their Science score improves more rapidly than other sections once they understand the underlying skills being tested and develop efficient strategies..</li></ul> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Example: Building Your Science Practice Plan Week 1-2: Master individual passage types untimed. Focus on Data Representation passages first (simplest), then Research Summaries, then Conflicting Viewpoints.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Week 3-4: Practice full Science sections with timing (35 minutes). Identify your weak passage types and question types.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
At first glance, Science passages often look intimidating with unfamiliar topics like the migratory patterns of monarch butterflies or the crystallization of magma, but success comes from understanding that you don''t need to be a science expert—you need to be skilled at quickly locating and analyzing data in charts, graphs, and tables. Mastering an efficient approach strategy is critical because you have only 35 minutes to handle 6 passages (approximately 5-6 minutes per passage), making time management and strategic passage navigation essential for maximizing your score.

1. Charts and Graphs Passages: The 30-Second Preview Strategy
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Of the 6 passages on the Science Test, 5 will consist of mostly graphs, charts, tables, and figures
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The other passage will be the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Conflicting Viewpoints</strong> passage, which we''ll discuss separately</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For the 5 Charts and Graphs passages, use the Figure-First approach described below</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Most of the information in Charts and Graphs passages is extra and unnecessary
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The majority of questions can be answered by just using the charts and graphs, not the text</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t spend time trying to read and understand the entire passage—it''s not necessary and you will run out of time!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Instead, spend around 30 seconds before starting the questions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
What to Do in Your 30-Second Preview
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Focus on the charts and graphs, paying special attention to:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The labels of the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">axes</strong> (what variables are being measured)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">What is being measured in each chart</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Where information is located</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For the text, just read the first sentence of the passage and of the experiment(s)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This gives you the basics of what the passage is about</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Scientists studied how temperature affects enzyme activity"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You don''t need detailed understanding—just the general topic</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">After these 30 seconds, you will not fully understand the passage, but that is okay
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You now know where the information is located</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You can proceed to the questions and find specific information as needed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Question Difficulty Progression and Time Management
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Within each passage, questions go from easy to hard
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The first two or three questions are generally very straightforward, often just asking you to spot a trend or find a data point</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">As you continue to later questions, they get more difficult by asking you to use experimental thinking, use multiple charts or graphs, or consider changes to the experiment</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Since each question is worth the same amount, be sure to get the easy ones correct
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you cannot figure out one of the last two questions in a passage, bubble in your best guess, circle the question, and move on</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You can always come back to it at the end if you still have time</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It is better to take your best guess and keep moving onto the next passage rather than spend a bunch of time on the most difficult questions and run out of time at the end of the section</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
The 5-6 Minute Per Passage Rule
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Time management is crucial in this section, as it is often the hardest one for students to finish
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You should be spending between 5-6 minutes on each passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you find yourself spending more than 30 seconds on a problem, bubble in your best guess, circle the number, and move on</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You can always come back if you have time at the end</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Using Questions to Guide You to Answers
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Find the easiest and fastest way to get the correct answers by trusting the questions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If a question begins with "Based on Figure 2," it means that the answer is in Figure 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Go to Figure 2 and find it! The ACT is not trying to trick you</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Let the questions help guide you to the right part of the passage</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">If the question does not direct you where to go, use keywords to help you
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Finding the variables discussed or units of the answer choices can quickly direct you to the right part of the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: If answer choices are in "°C," look for the figure with temperature on an axis</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Remember that you do not need to understand the experiment as a whole
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">As long as you can find the answer in the passage, just bubble it in and move on</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It''s okay to answer questions before fully understanding the passage</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
When to Go Back to the Text
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">If you read a question and see a term or word you do not know or cannot find in the charts or graphs, go back to the text
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Most questions on the Science Test do not require you to know definitions of variables</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">However, if you do need the definition, it will be in <em>italics</em>, making it easy to scan the passage and find them quickly</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read the definition and then answer the question</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Conflicting Viewpoints Passages: A Different Approach
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">At some point in the Science Test, you will find the one <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Conflicting Viewpoints</strong> passage
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This passage is easy to spot by looking for headings like "Scientist 1," "Scientist 2" or "Student 1," "Student 2"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This passage generally has more text and sometimes has no charts or graphs at all</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It is important to spot this passage quickly, as you must approach it differently</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Read and Annotate Strategy
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Rather than skimming, treat this more like a Reading passage
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read and annotate the entire thing</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">As you read, underline or write down the key differences between the viewpoints</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Having these notes will help you work more quickly on the questions rather than re-reading the text over and over again</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Most students save this passage for last
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It is the most time-consuming passage because reading text takes longer than skimming charts, graphs, tables, and diagrams</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The Conflicting Viewpoints passage is often more difficult than others</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you may run out of time, it is best to run out of time on the most time-consuming passage</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>For the 5 Charts and Graphs passages, spend only 30 seconds on your initial preview: focus on chart/graph axes and labels, read just the first sentence of the passage and experiments to get the general topic, then move directly to questions—most information in the text is unnecessary and you''ll run out of time if you try to read everything.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Questions within each passage progress from easy to hard, so prioritize getting the straightforward first questions correct, and if you''re stuck on difficult later questions for more than 30 seconds, guess and move on—each question is worth the same points, so spending 3 minutes on one hard question while missing 3 easy ones is a losing strategy.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Trust the questions to guide you: when a question says "Based on Figure 2," the answer is in Figure 2—the ACT isn''t trying to trick you—and use keywords, variables, and answer choice units to quickly locate the right chart or graph without wasting time reading unnecessary text.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>The Conflicting Viewpoints passage (identifiable by "Scientist 1/Scientist 2" headings) requires a different approach: read and annotate the entire passage like a Reading section passage, note key differences between viewpoints, and save this passage for last since it''s the most time-consuming—better to run out of time on the hardest passage than on easier Charts and Graphs passages.

1. The Four Places to Look in a Science Passage
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Every Science passage contains four distinct information sources
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Figures and Tables (most common, 60-70% of questions)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Experimental Text (procedures and descriptions)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Introductory Text (definitions and background)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Not in the Passage (basic science knowledge & experimental thinking)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Place 1: Figures and Tables
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The most frequently used source—approximately 60-70% of all questions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Most figure/table questions can be answered without reading any passage text</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The ACT typically makes it easy by explicitly directing you ("According to Figure 2...")</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When to look at Figures and Tables:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The question explicitly references a figure or table</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Answer choices are numbers with units (25 m/s, 1.5 kg, 300°C)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The question asks about trends, relationships, or comparisons between variables</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Place 2: Experimental Text
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Paragraphs that describe how experiments were conducted, what materials were used, and what variables were controlled
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Usually appears near the figures, often labeled "Experiment 1," "Trial 2," etc.</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Provides essential context that explains what the data represents</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When to look at Experimental Text:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Questions about experimental setup, procedures, or methods</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Questions about differences between experiments/trials</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Questions about variables or conditions not shown in figures</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Answer choices contain units or values not appearing in any figures</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">

</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Appears at the beginning and provides background information, context, and definitions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Important defined terms appear in <em>italics</em> for easy scanning</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Most questions don''t require using this section</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When to look at Introductory Text:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Question contains terms, abbreviations, or words you don''t recognize</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You need general background or context</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You''ve checked figures and experimental text but still can''t find what you need</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Place 4: Not in the Passage
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Some questions require basic scientific knowledge or experimental reasoning
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">

</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Two distinctive characteristics make these questions instantly recognizable:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Direct figure or table references ("According to Figure 2...", "Based on Table 1...")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">All four answer choices are numbers with units (5 cm, 8 cm, 12 cm, 18 cm)</li>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If answer choices show "g/mL," immediately look for density data labeled with "g/mL"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If choices show "°C," scan for temperature data</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t waste time examining figures with different units</li>

2. The Systematic 5-Step Approach
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Step 1: Locate the Correct Figure or Table</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Go immediately to the referenced figure—don''t look elsewhere first</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Verify you''re looking at the correct numbered figure if multiple are shown</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Always verify by checking the passage, even if you think you remember</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Step 2: Identify What You''re Looking For</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Determine what variable you need (temperature? pressure? concentration? growth?)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Note what conditions are specified ("at 17 days," "at 40°C," "in Trial 2")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Check the units in answer choices to confirm what measurement you''re finding</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Step 3: Locate the Correct Axes, Row, or Column</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For graphs: Identify which axis shows which variable (x-axis vs. y-axis)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For tables: Find the correct row and column headers</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Check legends/keys if multiple data series are shown</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Step 4: Find the Intersection or Data Value</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For graphs: Find the value on one axis, trace to the data line, then trace to the other axis</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For tables: Find where the relevant row and column intersect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use your finger or pencil to trace accurately if needed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Step 5: Match to Answer Choices</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Select the closest answer if exact value isn''t listed</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Verify units match between your data and the answer choice</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If your value doesn''t match any choice, double-check your figure, axis, scale, and data line</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

3. Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Mistake #1: Confusing X-Axis and Y-Axis</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Always verify which variable and units are on which axis before finding data</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t assume temperature is always on x-axis—check the labels!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is the #1 most common error on specific data point questions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Mistake #2: Misreading the Scale</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Check what each labeled mark represents—don''t assume consistent intervals</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Count unlabeled grid lines to determine interval size</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pay attention when axes don''t start at zero</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Mistake #3: Ignoring Units</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Always read units on axis labels or table headers</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Verify answer choice units match figure units</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t select based on number alone—check units too</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Mistake #4: Using the Wrong Figure or Data Series</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Verify figure number before reading any data</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Check legend/key to identify correct line/curve/symbol</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pay attention to line styles (solid vs. dashed) and symbols (circles vs. squares)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Mistake #5: Rushing and Misreading Questions</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read carefully: "how much lower" ≠ "how high"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Note exact values: "at 4 seconds" ≠ "at 40 seconds"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Taking 3 extra seconds to read carefully prevents careless errors</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Use answer choices to eliminate impossible values
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If figure shows values 10-50, eliminate choices with 5 or 75</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If graph clearly shows increasing trend, eliminate "decreased" answers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">These questions should be fast—30-45 seconds per question
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">They''re designed to be straightforward if you follow the systematic approach</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Bank time here for more difficult questions later</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">But don''t rush so fast that you make careless errors</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Always verify by checking the passage, not relying on memory
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Even if you think you remember the data, take 3-5 seconds to confirm</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This prevents errors from misremembering or confusing similar data</li>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Trend questions ask you to identify patterns in how variables change rather than reading specific numerical values, and they can range from simple questions that track how numbers change across a graph to challenging questions that require identifying non-obvious trends within complex data tables. The key to mastering trend questions is recognizing them quickly by their answer choices (which typically include phrases like "increased only," "decreased then increased," or "remained constant") and focusing on the pattern of change rather than exact values.

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Increased only</strong> — The variable continuously goes up throughout the range</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Decreased only</strong> — The variable continuously goes down throughout the range</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Increased then decreased</strong> — The variable rises first, then falls (or vice versa)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Remained constant</strong> — The variable stays the same throughout</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Varied with no general trend</strong> — The variable changes randomly without a clear pattern</li>

2. Analyzing Trends in Charts and Graphs
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For trend questions using charts and graphs, follow this systematic approach:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Identify the correct data series</strong> — Bar graphs often show multiple categories (different forests, different fertilizers, etc.). Make sure you''re tracking the right bars or lines</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Follow the pattern left to right (or along the specified axis)</strong> — Trace how the values change as you move across the graph</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Don''t worry about exact numbers</strong> — You only need to determine if values are going up, down, or staying the same</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Watch for direction changes</strong> — Look for peaks or valleys that indicate "increased then decreased" patterns</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Trend questions in tables are often more challenging because you must identify which trials or rows to compare. The key is understanding experimental design</li>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
The One-Variable Rule
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">To identify a valid trend, you must compare trials where <strong>only one independent variable changes</strong> while all other variables remain constant. This isolates the effect of that single variable
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 1: Read the question carefully</strong> — Identify which variable(s) should be changing and which should remain constant</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 2: Scan the table for matching trials</strong> — Find rows where only your variable of interest changes</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 3: Trace the pattern</strong> — Follow how the dependent variable changes as the independent variable changes</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Step 4: Match to answer choices</strong> — Describe the pattern using the trend terminology</li>

Common Mistakes to Avoid
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Tracking the wrong data series</strong> — In multi-category graphs, students often follow the wrong bars or lines. Always double-check which category the question asks about</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Comparing trials with multiple changing variables</strong> — If more than one variable changes between trials, you cannot determine which variable caused the trend</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Confusing "increased then decreased" with "decreased then increased"</strong> — Pay attention to the order of the trend</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Getting distracted by exact values</strong> — Trend questions test pattern recognition, not precise data reading. Focus on the direction of change</li>
</ul>

Speed Tips
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Use your pencil as a visual guide</strong> — Trace along bars or lines to track the trend more clearly</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Eliminate obvious wrong answers first</strong> — If a variable clearly goes up, immediately eliminate "decreased only" and "remained constant"</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>For tables, circle the relevant trials</strong> — Physically mark which rows you need to compare to avoid confusion</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Watch for symmetry</strong> — Some experiments show the same trend across multiple conditions, which can help you verify your answer</li>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Approximation questions ask you to estimate the value of a data point that is not explicitly shown in the figures or tables, requiring you to use the given values to determine where the missing data point would logically fall. These questions are instantly recognizable by their distinctive answer choices, which provide ranges like "less than 100 m," "between 100 m and 150 m," or "greater than 250 m" rather than single numerical values.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. How to Identify Approximation Questions
</h3>

<p style="margin-left: 1.5rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65; margin-top: 1rem;">
Approximation questions are the easiest question type to identify on the entire Science Test because the answer choices immediately give them away:
</p>

<h4 style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 600;">
Typical Answer Choice Formats
</h4>

<ul style="margin-left: 3rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.75; margin-top: 0.75rem;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Less than [value]</strong> — e.g., "Less than 100 m"</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Between [value 1] and [value 2]</strong> — e.g., "Between 100 m and 150 m"</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Greater than [value]</strong> — e.g., "Greater than 250 m"</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left: 3rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65; margin-top: 1rem; font-style: italic; color: #6b7280;">
Every time you see answer choices formatted with ranges like this, you know you''re dealing with an approximation question. This means the question is asking about a value that is NOT directly shown in the figures or tables.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 600;">
What Makes These Questions Unique
</h4>

<ul style="margin-left: 3rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.75; margin-top: 0.75rem;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">The question asks for a value at a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">condition that wasn''t tested</strong> (e.g., "at 45°F" when only 40°F and 50°F were tested)</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">You must <strong>estimate or interpolate</strong> between given data points</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Sometimes you must <strong>extrapolate beyond</strong> the range of the graph</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Approximation on Graphs: Two Types
</h3>

<p style="margin-left: 1.5rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65; margin-top: 1rem;">
Approximation questions on graphs fall into two categories: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">bracketing</strong> and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">extending</strong>.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 600;">
Type 1: Bracketing (Interpolation)
</h4>

<p style="margin-left: 3rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65; margin-top: 1rem;">
<strong>Bracketing questions</strong> ask you to find a data point that falls <strong>between</strong> two given data points on the graph.
</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 3rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.75; margin-top: 0.75rem;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Identify which two data points the requested value falls between</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Locate these two points on the graph</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Estimate where the missing value would fall on the curve or line between them</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Match your estimate to the answer choice ranges</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left: 3rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65; margin-top: 1rem; font-style: italic; color: #6b7280;">
<strong>Example:</strong> If the graph shows Pine growth at 40°F (10 cm) and 50°F (20 cm), and the question asks about 45°F, you''d estimate the value falls between 10 and 20 cm—likely around 15 cm.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 600;">
Type 2: Extending (Extrapolation)
</h4>

<p style="margin-left: 3rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65; margin-top: 1rem;">
<strong>Extending questions</strong> ask you about a data point that falls <strong>outside</strong> the range of the graph.
</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 3rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.75; margin-top: 0.75rem;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Identify the trend or pattern of the curve/line</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Use your pencil to extend the trend line beyond the graph</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Estimate where the extended line would intersect the requested value</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Match to the answer choice ranges</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left: 3rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65; margin-top: 1rem; font-style: italic; color: #6b7280;">
<strong>Example:</strong> If the graph shows Palm growth increasing from 50°F to 60°F, and the question asks about 70°F (beyond the graph), you''d extend the upward trend to estimate the growth would be even higher.

3. Approximation in Tables
</h3>

<p style="margin-left: 1.5rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65; margin-top: 1rem;">
Approximation questions in tables require you to locate the correct trials to compare, just like trend questions. The key difference is that you''re estimating a value that falls between the given data points.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 600;">
Strategy for Table Approximation
</h4>

<ul style="margin-left: 3rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.75; margin-top: 0.75rem;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Step 1: Identify the variable being questioned</strong> — Determine what value you need to approximate</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Step 2: Find trials with constant control variables</strong> — Look for rows where only the independent variable of interest changes (apply the one-variable rule)</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Step 3: Locate bracketing trials</strong> — Find the two trials that bracket the requested value</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Step 4: Estimate the dependent variable</strong> — Determine where the answer falls based on the pattern</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Step 5: Match to answer ranges</strong> — Select the answer choice that includes your estimate</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 600;">
Common Table Challenges
</h4>

<ul style="margin-left: 3rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.75; margin-top: 0.75rem;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Easy questions:</strong> Follow trends across the entire table when all other variables remain constant</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Difficult questions:</strong> Identify specific trials where only one variable changes; ignore trials with multiple changing variables</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Critical mistake:</strong> Comparing trials where multiple variables change—this makes approximation impossible</li>
</ul>

</h4>

<ul style="margin-left: 3rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.75; margin-top: 0.75rem;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Use your test booklet!</strong> — Draw on graphs to extend trend lines or mark interpolation points with your pencil</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Don''t overthink precision</strong> — You only need a rough estimate to eliminate wrong answer ranges</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Look for obvious eliminations</strong> — If a value must be higher than 100, immediately cross out "less than 100"</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Check curve direction</strong> — Make sure your approximation follows the direction of the trend (increasing, decreasing, or leveling off)</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>For tables, circle relevant trials</strong> — Physically mark the trials you''re using to avoid confusion</li>

  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Extrapolating incorrectly</strong> — When extending beyond the graph, some students assume linear trends when the curve is actually leveling off or changing direction</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Using the wrong data series</strong> — On multi-line graphs, make sure you''re looking at the correct line (Pine vs. Fir vs. Palm, etc.)</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Ignoring units</strong> — Pay attention to whether the question asks for temperature, height, time, etc.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Reading exact values</strong> — These questions specifically ask about values NOT in the data, so if you find an exact match, you''re looking at the wrong part of the figure</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Comparing incompatible trials</strong> — In tables, only compare trials where control variables match</li>

More challenging questions on the ACT Science Test require you to use information from multiple tables or figures to find the correct answer, demanding that you understand how different data representations relate to each other and can chain information from one source to another. The key to mastering these questions is recognizing the connection between the figures—typically, you find a data point in the first figure, use that value to locate information in the second figure, and finally use that second piece of information to determine your answer.

1. How to Identify Multiple Figures Questions
</h3>

<p style="margin-left: 1.5rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65; margin-top: 1rem;">
Multiple figures questions are easy to spot because the question stem explicitly directs you to consider more than one data source:

  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>"Using information from both graphs, ..."</strong> — Clear signal to combine data</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left: 3rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65; margin-top: 1rem; font-style: italic; color: #6b7280;">

</h3>

<p style="margin-left: 1.5rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65; margin-top: 1rem;">
Most multiple figures questions follow a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">chain pattern</strong>: information flows from one figure to the next in a sequence.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 600;">
The Three-Step Chain Process
</h4>

<ul style="margin-left: 3rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.75; margin-top: 0.75rem;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Step 1: Find the starting data point in Figure 1</strong> — Read a specific value from the first figure or table</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Step 2: Use that value to locate information in Figure 2</strong> — The data point from Figure 1 becomes your search criterion in Figure 2</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Step 3: Extract your final answer from Figure 2</strong> — Read the corresponding value that answers the question</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left: 3rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65; margin-top: 1rem; font-style: italic; color: #6b7280;">
<strong>Example chain:</strong> "At L = 3 kg in Sample 2 (Figure 1), what is H? → Find H = 12 → Now look at Figure 2: when H = 12 for Sample 2, what is B? → Answer: B = 25"
</p>

<h4 style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 600;">
Pay Attention to Axis Labels
</h4>

<p style="margin-left: 3rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65; margin-top: 1rem;">
The axes and column headers are critical for chaining information correctly:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 3rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.75; margin-top: 0.75rem;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">The <strong>output variable</strong> from Figure 1 often becomes the <strong>input variable</strong> for Figure 2</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Check units carefully—make sure you''re matching the same measurement</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Verify you''re tracking the same sample, trial, or experimental condition across both figures</li>
</ul>

3. When to Use Experimental Text
</h3>

<p style="margin-left: 1.5rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65; margin-top: 1rem;">
Sometimes multiple figures questions ask about information that isn''t directly shown in any figure or table. In these cases, you must consult the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">experimental text</strong> above the figures.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 600;">
When to Check the Experimental Text
</h4>

<ul style="margin-left: 3rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.75; margin-top: 0.75rem;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>The question asks about variables not shown in the figures</strong> — e.g., "How many trials were run without electricity?" when electricity isn''t listed in any chart</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>You need to understand experimental setup</strong> — e.g., "What was held constant across all samples?"</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>The question references experimental conditions</strong> — e.g., "In which experiment was temperature controlled?"</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>You need definitions</strong> — e.g., understanding what "Sample 1" represents</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 600;">
Strategy for Using Text + Figures Together
</h4>

<ul style="margin-left: 3rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.75; margin-top: 0.75rem;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Read the question and identify what information you need</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Check the figures first—if the data is there, use it</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> If the figures don''t have the needed information, scan the experimental text</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Combine information from text and figures as needed</li>
</ul>

4. Common Mistakes and Pro Tips
</h3>

<h4 style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 600;">
Common Mistakes to Avoid
</h4>

<ul style="margin-left: 3rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.75; margin-top: 0.75rem;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Mixing up samples or trials</strong> — The most common error! If you''re tracking Sample 2 in Figure 1, make sure you track Sample 2 (not Sample 1 or 3) in Figure 2</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Stopping after the first figure</strong> — Students often find a value in Figure 1 and mistakenly choose it as the answer, forgetting to complete the chain to Figure 2</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Misreading axes</strong> — Using the wrong variable because you didn''t check which axis is which</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Ignoring units</strong> — Confusing similar measurements (e.g., velocity in m/s vs. km/h)</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Not reading experimental text when needed</strong> — Missing critical setup information that would clarify the relationship between figures</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 600;">
Pro Tips for Success
</h4>

<ul style="margin-left: 3rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.75; margin-top: 0.75rem;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Write down intermediate values</strong> — Jot the value from Figure 1 in the margin before moving to Figure 2 to avoid losing track</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Use your finger or pencil to trace</strong> — Physically point to the sample/trial you''re tracking to avoid mixing them up</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Circle or underline key words</strong> — Mark which experiments, studies, samples, or trials the question asks about</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Check figure labels carefully</strong> — Verify you''re looking at the correct figure number before extracting data</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Map the connection between figures</strong> — Quickly identify which variable connects Figure 1 to Figure 2 (often the y-axis of Figure 1 becomes the x-axis of Figure 2)</li>

On certain Science questions, the information shown in figures and tables alone is insufficient to answer the question, requiring you to consult the experimental text above the figures to find missing details about variables, experimental conditions, or setup parameters. These questions test your ability to integrate information from multiple sources—combining numerical data from figures with contextual information from the passage text to arrive at the correct answer.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. When Figures Alone Aren''t Enough
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Most Science questions can be answered using only the figures and tables, but some questions require additional context from the experimental text
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The question asks about units or values for a specific term that are not shown anywhere in the figures or tables</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The question references experimental conditions, setup details, or control variables not visible in the data displays</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You need definitions of abbreviations, variables, or scientific terms used in the question</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
How to Recognize These Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The question asks about something not visible in any figure or table
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "How many trials were run without electricity?" when electricity isn''t shown in any chart</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "What was the initial temperature?" when figures only show final temperatures</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The question uses terms or abbreviations you don''t recognize
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: A question mentions "RM" but you don''t know what RM stands for</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The experimental text will define these terms in the introduction or setup description</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

2. Where to Look in the Experimental Text
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The experimental text typically appears directly above the figures and tables, organized into clear sections
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Introductory section</strong> — Defines terms, explains the general topic, describes what the experiment is studying</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Experiment/Study descriptions</strong> — Details the specific procedures, lists control variables, explains what changed between trials</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Figure captions</strong> — Sometimes crucial information appears in small text directly below or above figures</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Strategic Reading Approach
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Don''t read the experimental text during your initial 30-second preview
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Most questions won''t need it, so reading it upfront wastes time</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Only go to the text when a question specifically requires information not in the figures</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When you do need the text, scan strategically
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for bold terms, capitalized abbreviations, or numbered experiments that match the question</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read only the relevant section—you don''t need to read the entire passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Once you find the information, return immediately to the question</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

3. Common Scenarios Requiring Text
</h3>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Scenario 1: Control Variables
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Question asks: "In which trials was [variable X] held constant?"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Variable X doesn''t appear in any figure or table</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solution: Check the experimental text describing each experiment''s conditions</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The text will explicitly state which variables were controlled</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Scenario 2: Initial Conditions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Question asks about starting values or initial setup
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Figures only show final measurements or changes over time</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solution: The experimental description states initial conditions before measurements began</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Scenario 3: Term Definitions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Question uses abbreviations or specialized terms
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "RM," "reactive material," "compound X"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Solution: Introductory paragraph defines all key terms and abbreviations</li>

Pro Tips
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Check figures first, always</strong> — Even on "text required" questions, start by checking if the answer might actually be in a figure you missed</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Use keywords to locate information</strong> — If the question asks about "electricity," scan the text for that exact word</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Don''t read more than necessary</strong> — Extract only the specific fact you need, then return to the question</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Mark helpful text</strong> — If a passage requires multiple text lookups, underline or circle key facts for quicker reference</li>
</ul>

Common Mistakes
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Reading all the text upfront</strong> — This wastes precious time since most questions don''t need it</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Assuming information must be in a figure</strong> — If you can''t find it after checking all figures, go to the text instead of guessing</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Reading the wrong experiment''s description</strong> — Make sure you''re reading about Experiment 1 if the question asks about Experiment 1</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong>Getting lost in unnecessary details</strong> — Stay focused on finding the one specific piece of information the question needs</li>

      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Yes, because the boiling point of water is above 100°C"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "No, acetone has the lowest percent combustibility at 40°C"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The claim is the first part (Yes/No or which option)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The explanation follows "because" or "as" or similar connecting words</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Most two-part questions follow a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">standard pattern</strong>:

Strategy: Start with the Explanation
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Begin by evaluating the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">explanation</strong> (the part after "because"):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Explanations are usually based on figures, tables, or basic scientific facts</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">They''re much easier to verify than claims</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You can quickly eliminate 2 incorrect answers by finding the wrong explanation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">How to check explanations:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look at the figure or table referenced</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Verify specific numerical values or trends</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use basic scientific knowledge (boiling point of water = 100°C, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Once you''ve eliminated 2 answers with wrong explanations, evaluate the claim between the remaining 2 answers</li>
</ul>

Common Patterns and Shortcuts
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Using the standard pattern to your advantage:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you determine the explanation is correct, eliminate answers with the opposite explanation</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you can''t determine the claim, picking the right explanation gives you a 50/50 chance</li>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The figure doesn''t show the specific variable you need</li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Unit mismatches</strong> are a common trick in difficult questions:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Question asks for grams per week, but figure shows total weight gain</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Question asks for individual dog consumption, but figure shows group totals</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Question asks for percentage of one food type, but only total percentages are given</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Pay close attention to what units the question asks for vs. what units are provided</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Aggregated vs. individual data</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the figure shows total for a group, you cannot determine individual values</li>

Systematic Search Strategy
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 1: Identify exactly what the question is asking for:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">What variable? (weight, food amount, percentage, etc.)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">What units? (grams, grams per week, percentage, etc.)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For which subject? (individual, group, specific food type, etc.)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">At what time/condition? (after 3 hours, at Week 4, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 2: Check the figure referenced:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look at axis labels - do they match what you need?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Check the legend - does it show the specific group/food type?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Verify the units match what the question asks for</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 3: Check tables (if present):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Do the rows/columns include the specific item you need?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Can you combine information from multiple tables/figures?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 4: Check experimental text:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Sometimes the answer is in the description above the figures</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for setup details, control variables, or baseline measurements</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 5: Only if you cannot find the information anywhere:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Choose "Cannot be determined"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Be confident - if the data truly isn''t there, this is the correct answer</li>
    </ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 1: Identify the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">variables</strong> in the equations and match them to the data:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Figure out which variable is which (x-axis, y-axis, table columns)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Make sure you understand what each variable represents</li>

  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 2: Choose the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">easiest data point</strong> to test:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for simple numbers (0, 1, 10, 100) that make calculations easy</li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Linear relationships</strong> (y = mx + b):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Data points form a straight line</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Constant rate of change</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Temperature decreases by 5°C for each 1km increase in altitude</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Inverse relationships</strong> (y = k/x):
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">As one variable increases, the other decreases</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Product of x and y is constant</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Pressure decreases as volume increases (P = k/V)</li>

Tips for Quick Elimination
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Check the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">direction of relationship</strong> first:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If data shows y increasing as x increases, eliminate equations with negative slopes</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If data shows y decreasing as x increases, eliminate equations with positive slopes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Use <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">special values</strong> strategically:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When x=0, equations simplify to y = b (the y-intercept)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When y=0, you can solve for x-intercept</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When x=1, equations simplify nicely (y = m + b)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Don''t waste time doing complex algebra - systematically test one data point at a time until you eliminate all wrong answers</li>

    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look at axis labels and units</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Note the scale (linear, logarithmic, etc.)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Check the range of values shown</li>

  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">To find the value of a specific point:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Draw an imaginary vertical line down to the x-axis</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Draw an imaginary horizontal line to the y-axis</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read the values where these lines intersect the axes</li>

</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Questions often ask: "How many trials were conducted at [specific condition]?"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Find the x-value that matches the condition</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Draw an imaginary vertical line at that x-value</li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">When counting points:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Be systematic - count from top to bottom or bottom to top</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Watch for overlapping points (multiple trials at same x and y)</li>

Understanding Figures with Multiple Y-Axes
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Many ACT Science figures show <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">two different y-axes</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Left y-axis</strong>: typically shows one measurement with its own scale</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Right y-axis</strong>: shows a different measurement with a different scale</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both measurements share the same <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">x-axis</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Why use multiple y-axes?
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">To compare two variables that have different units (e.g., temperature in °C and pressure in kPa)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">To show variables with very different ranges (e.g., 0-100 vs. 0-5)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">To visualize how two different measurements change together</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">How to read figures with multiple y-axes:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Identify which line/curve corresponds to which y-axis (check the legend or labels)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When reading a value, trace horizontally to the CORRECT y-axis for that variable</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Never mix up the axes - using the wrong axis gives a completely wrong answer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
Identifying Which Axis to Use
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Critical strategy: Match the variable name to the axis label
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the question asks about "temperature," look for the y-axis labeled "Temperature (°C)"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the question asks about "pressure," look for the y-axis labeled "Pressure (kPa)"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Check units carefully - they tell you which axis to use</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Visual cues that help identify the correct axis:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Lines/curves are often color-coded to match their corresponding y-axis</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Legends typically specify which line uses which axis</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Axis labels include units that match the variable in the question</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Common mistake to avoid:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Reading from the left axis when you should use the right axis (or vice versa)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is one of the most common errors on ACT Science</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Always double-check: Does the axis label match what the question is asking?</li>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 1: Identify <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">exactly what the question is asking</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for key words: "increase," "decrease," "total," "average," "difference"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Determine what operation you need to perform</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Note the units in the question</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 2: Locate the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">correct values</strong> in the data:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Find the specific rows, columns, or data points needed</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Double-check you''re reading from the correct axis or column</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Verify the units match what the question asks for</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 3: Perform the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">calculation</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Do the math carefully - these are usually simple calculations</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Watch for negative signs and decimals</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Round only if the question asks for it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 4: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check your answer</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Does the magnitude make sense? (e.g., average should be between min and max)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Are the units correct?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Did you answer the exact question asked?</li>

  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Unit conversion traps</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Figure shows grams, question asks for kilograms</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Figure shows minutes, question asks for hours</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Always check if you need to convert units before calculating</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Rate vs. total amount</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Question asks for "per hour" but figure shows total</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Must divide total by time to get rate</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: 120 miles in 3 hours → Rate = 120 ÷ 3 = 40 miles per hour</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Increase vs. final value</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"What was the increase?" → Find the difference (subtract)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"What was the final value?" → Just read the final value (don''t subtract)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Make sure you understand which one the question is asking for</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Reading the wrong row/column</strong>:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Tables can be confusing - double-check your values</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use your finger to trace from row header to column</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This simple mistake accounts for many wrong answers</li>

Quick Tips for Accuracy
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Write down the values you''re using before calculating - this prevents reading errors</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For averages, double-check how many values you''re averaging</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">If an answer choice is way bigger or smaller than the others, check your decimal point</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Use <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">estimation</strong> to eliminate obviously wrong answers quickly</li>

Strategy for Conflicting Viewpoints
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 1: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Skim the introduction</strong> to understand the topic
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">What phenomenon or question is being debated?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t get bogged down in details - just get the gist</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 2: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Go straight to the questions</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don''t read all viewpoints in detail first</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Let the questions guide what you need to read</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 3: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">For each question, locate the relevant viewpoint</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Question about Scientist 1? Read only that section</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Question comparing viewpoints? Read both sections</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Be efficient - don''t read more than necessary</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 4: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Identify the main claim</strong> of each viewpoint
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Usually stated in the first 1-2 sentences</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Scientist 1 believes the extinction was caused by asteroids"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Scientist 2 argues that volcanic activity was responsible"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Step 5: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Note key differences and similarities</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">What do they disagree on?</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">What do they agree on (if anything)?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Tips for Success
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Don''t take sides - remain objective and understand each viewpoint on its own terms</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Watch for <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">extreme language</strong> in answer choices:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Both scientists agree that..." → Must be stated by BOTH</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">"Only Scientist 1 believes..." → Must be unique to Scientist 1</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For "new evidence" questions, ask: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">What would each viewpoint predict?</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If new data matches Scientist 1''s prediction → supports Scientist 1</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If new data contradicts Scientist 2''s prediction → weakens Scientist 2</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">These passages require more reading than data interpretation passages, but the questions are often straightforward if you know where to look</li>
</ul>
