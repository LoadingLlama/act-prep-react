Chapter 29: Unit Conversion
You need to know how to properly convert units on the ACT. A few common conversion factors you should
know are listed below.
1 foot = 12 inches

1 yard = 3 feet

1 hour = 60 minutes

1 minute = 60 seconds

For other conversions, such as pounds to kilograms, the ACT provides the conversion factor as part of the

question.
Example 1: A string that is 10 feet and 3 inches long is cut into three pieces of equal length. What is the
length of each piece of string?
A. 3 feetlinch

B. 3feet3 inches

C. 3 feetS inches

D. 3 feet 8 inches.

Solution: First, we need to convert the original length of the string to inches. For a question like this, you
need to convert the length to one unit before dividing. To convert 10 feet to inches, we multiply by 12:
10 feet x

12 inches
1 foot

= 120 inches

So, 10 feet and 3 inches has a total length of 123 inches. To find the length of each piece, we divide by 3:
123 inches

5

= 41 inches per piece

Now, we need to convert 41 inches to feet. 36 inches = 3 feet, which leaves 5 inches leftover to get to 41
inches. The length of each piece of sting is 3 feet 5 inches. The answer is C.
Example 2: A tennis court is 78 feet long and 36 feet wide. What is the area, in square yards, of a tennis
court?
A. 312

B. 936

C. 2,808

D. 8,424

Solution: We covered questions like this in Chapter 4 (pg. 15-16), but let’s revisit them again since they are a
classic unit conversion question that appears commonly on the ACT. To solve questions involving unit
conversion and areas or volumes correctly, convert the units BEFORE solving for any area or volume.

For this example, we are asked to solve for square yards, so we need to first convert feet to yards:
i

lyard _

Length = 78 feet x S fest = 26 yards

Width = 36 feet x 3 S*
= 12 yards
feet
Now that the units are converted to yards, we can find the area of the tennis court in square yards.

A = lw = (36 yards)(12 yards) = 312 square yards
The answer is A.

*Test-Day Tip: Anytime you see units written in bold, pay close attention and make sure you are
solving for the correct units. By putting the units in bold, the ACT is telling you to pay close attention to the
units to help make sure you do not accidentally solve for the incorrect units.

Dimensional Analysis
For more advanced unit conversion questions, you need to know dimensional analysis, which uses conversion
factors to convert from one unit to another. In the previous examples, we did some dimensions analysis to
convert feet to inches and feet to yards.
To set dimensional analysis, complete the following steps:
1.

Start with the value given in the question.

2.

Use the conversion factor(s) to switch the units.

3.

Multiply and divide the numbers to find the answer.

If the conversion factor(s) are setup correctly, the answer will have the correct unit and all other units
will cancel! An example of how to do this is shown below:
Example 3: The top speed of Andrew’s toy car is 30 meters per second. What is the top speed of the

toy car in kilometers per hour? (1 kilometer = 1,000 meters)
A.

1,800

B. 500

C.

108

D. 90

Solution: To solve this question, we need to convert meters to kilometers and seconds to hours.
Whenever we are given a rate that includes two units, we can set it up as a fraction. In this
question, we are given the speed in meters per second, so we can set up 30 meters per second as:
30 meters

“1second:
From here, we need to convert the units. Notice how that in each step below, we set up the conversion
factor so the units cancel.

3. Convert minutes to hours.

4. Simplify the answer.

You can also solve this question in one big step as shown below.

The answer is C.

The most difficult part of unit conversion questions is setting up the conversion factors correctly, so pay close
attention to the units. Ifthe units cancel and you finish with the units the question is asking for, the equation is
up properly, and you will have the correct answer.

Example 4: Erica bikes at an average speed of 24 miles per hour for 40 minutes. If Rosie bikes at an
average speed of 18 miles per hour, approximately many minutes does it take Rosie to bike the same
distance that Erica biked in 40 minutes?
A. 53

B. 56

C. 60

D. 67

Solution: We first need to find out how far Erica bikes in 40 minutes. To solve this, it is important to
remember that distance = speed Xx time. We need to multiply the time Erica bikes by her speed to find the
distance. But first, we need to convert her speed from miles per hour to miles per minute:
24 miles

1 hour

1 hour

60 minutes

:

= 0.4 miles/minute

Now, we can find the distance using the speed and the time.
distance =

0.4 miles
1 minute

x 40 minutes = 16 miles

To find out how long it takes Rosie to bike 16 miles, we need to convert Rosie’s speed from miles per hour to
miles per minute:
18 miles

1 hour

1 hour

60 minutes

:

= 0.3 miles/minute

To solve for time, we divide the distance by the speed:
time =

distance
speed

=

16 miles

.

0.3 miles/minute

= 53.3 minutes

The answer is A. The question says “approximately,” so we round our answer to 53.

Example 5: A metal pipe that is p feet long will be cut into 7 pieces that are each x inches long. Which
of the following expressions correctly describes length, in inches, of each of the n pieces of pipe?
12

A.x=—
n

p

px

B. x=—
nx

12n

CAx=—
12n

D.
x =—
px

Solution #1 - “Math Teacher Way”: We first need to convert the length of the metal pipe from feet to inches:
p feet Xx

12 inches
1 foot

= 12p inches

Then, we need to cut it into n pieces, so we will divide the metal pipe by n:
12p inches

n pieces of pipe

= x inches

per

perp

piece of

pipe

Pip

The answer is A.

Method #2 — Substitution: If solving algebraically seems tricky, we use substitution and pick numbers to
make this question easier. Let’s say that the metal pipe is 2 feet long (p = 2) and that we will cut it into 3
pieces (n = 3). From here, we can easily solve for x, the length of each piece in inches:
2 feet x
24 inches

12 inches
1 foot

= 24 inches

= 8 inches per piece

With the numbers we picked, we found that x = 8. From here, we plug our values of p = 2, = n = 3, and
x = 8 into the answer choices to find out which equation is correct. Let’s confirm this works by plugging in
our values to answer choice A.
8

__ 12(2)

3

8=8

The equation works with our numbers, so we know that the answer is A.
