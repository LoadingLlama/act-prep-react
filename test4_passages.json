If the writer were to delete the words “invaluable” and “firsthand” from the preceding sentence, the sentence divers may remain underwater—often no more than two hours—<u id=\"q17\">has led</u> scientists to call for robots ableto help conduct observations <u id=\"q18\">in an assistive capacity</u>. \r\n\r\nComplex functions like detecting chemicals and mapping <u id=\"q19\">topography, and these</u> have already been implemented in robots with wide success. The bigger challenge is teaching a robot to swim. \r\n\r\nPowerful thrusters have helped some robots <u id=\"q20\">surge</u> through the depths. Such <u id=\"q21\">equipment, however</u> can alarm or even harm sea life. The engineers developing the robot AQUA2 imagined a robot able to <u id=\"q22\"> use advanced imaging and electromechanical systems.</u> To do so, it would need to swim as naturally as a fish squid, or—as it turned out—a turtle.\r\n\r\nAQUAZ has also proved remarkably well adapted to land. Its flippers reverse direction in shallow water, <u id=\"q23\">pushing the robot</u> up onto sturdy, arched legs. The legs <u id=\"q24\"> </u> propel the robot out of the surf. Rubber treads on each leg allow AQUA2 to scale sand dunes or snowbanks, making the robot as suitable for studies in the Caribbean <u id=\"q25\">as well as</u> those in the Arctic. \r\n\r\nLike its biological counterpart, AQUA2 has flippers that allow it to glide through the water, dive to the ocean floor, and ascend from the bottom. Unlike thruster-powered robots, <u id=\"q26\">AQUA2 can make subtle changes in course simply by</u>  altering the positions of its flippers. \r\n\r\n\r\nBy holding two flippers <u id=\"q27\">still, as it gently paddles, </u> with the other four, for example, the robot can \"hover\" in place underwater. This <u id=\"q28\">exquisite competency</u> will allow it to avoid disturbing the sea life it is designed to observe. \r\n\r\nNow, AQUA2 faces a new challenge; even more tricky than reacting to different terrains is interacting with human divers. During field tests amid busy coral reefs in Barbados and <u id=\"q29\">the silty beds of lakes in Canada,</u> AQUA2 practices following divers’ instructions. Soon, scientists may be able to conduct more frequent, more efficient dives with robotic partners at their sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In the 1960s, though, land developers saw commercial potential for the area. Some wanted to build an oil refinery. [A] Others, because of Biscayne Bay’s natural beauty, wanted beach resorts. <u id=\"q32\">However, Lancelot Jones, one of two year-round residents, of the islands</u> wanted to preserve the bay. \r\n\r\n<u id=\"q33\">Porgy Key had always been home for Jones,</u> a small island in Biscayne Bay. His father had purchased the land for $300 in <u id=\"q34\">1897, and Jones grew up there, cultivating</u> pineapples and Key limes. <u id=\"q35\">Therefore, in</u> 1935, Jones began guiding fishing trips; his knowledge of fishing earned him the reputation for being the area’s best fishing guide. [B]Among his clientele were several US <u id=\"q36\">presidents, including:</u> Hoover, Kennedy, and Nixon. \r\n\r\n[1] In 1961, fourteen of the eighteen landowners came to Biscayne Bay and voted to found a city on the bay’s islands to expedite commercial development of the land.

Video surveillance revealed the culprits; two northern flickers, a species of woodpecker, <u id=\"q47\">was attempting to excavate</u> a nest in the fuel tank’s foam insulation. Upon striking the solid metal beneath, the flickers would stubbornly choose a new spot and try again. <u id=\"q48\">  </u>\r\n\r\n[1] In the northern United States, where most flickers return each summer to mate and raise broods, the<u id=\"q49\">birds' persistence is</u> well known. \r\n\r\n[2] <u id=\"q50\">By lacking</u> a distinct song, flickers drum their beaks against hard surfaces to announce themselves to mates. [3] The louder the noise an object makes, the more attractive it is to flickers. [4] Among their favorite noisemakers are drainpipes, TV antennas, and even farm equipment. [5] At the Kennedy Space Center in <u id=\"q51\">Florida, though</u> the flickers’ persistence seemed mysterious. [6] Worse, it posed a serious risk. \r\n\r\n<u id=\"q52\">For solid metal to </u> the birds from trying to nest at the launch site, how could NASA prevent damage to <u id=\"q53\">its</u> equipment and keep the species safe? <u id=\"q54\"> </u>\r\n\r\nNASA put together a committee, dubbed the Bird Investigation Review and Deterrent (BIRD) team, to consult with wildlife experts. After learning that flickers\r\nseek out soft, rotted wood when excavating nests, the team recommended the removal of dead trees from the area. <u id=\"q55\">For instance,</u> upon learning that flickers forage for food on the ground, BIRD <u id=\"q56\">determined</u>  that tidy lawns made crawling insects easily visible. The team advised NASA to let the grass grow <u id=\"q57\">long to give</u> the birds the impression that food was hard to catch. <u id=\"q58\">  </u>\r\n\r\nOther, less subtle strategies were implemented to ensure that the birds didn’t settle in. Deterred by plastic owls and floating balloons, <u id=\"q59\">alternatively,</u> the flickers soon left for new territory.

Her <i> Tanztheater,</i> translated “dance theater,’ pieces received international acclaim for <u id=\"q61\">those</u> expressive, unconventional styleand the often-raw <u id=\"q62\">emotional feelings</u> they portrayed. \r\n\r\nWhen Bausch began her formal dance education in 1955, Expressionism was again the dominant style. Bausch followed the Expressionists’ lead (and that of other dance pioneers like Martha Graham from the ’20s). She tackled existential themes—identity, alienation, romantic entanglements, suffering—portrayed through intense, sometimes violent, movements.\r\n\r\nBy the <u id=\"q63\">1920s and up until the onset of World War II.</u> German art was flourishing and had turned to the abstract. Expressionism, as it was called, <u id=\"q64\"> </u> replaced representational, or literal, modes of painting. Bausch,\r\n\r\nborn in 1940, <u id=\"q65\">having grown</u> up in postwar Germany.

          "B. Yes, because the essay explains how American and European forms of dance were influenced by shifting national identities.",
          "C. No, because the essay mainly focuses on Bausch's <i>Tanztheater</i> and the international acclaim it received.",
          "D. No, because the essay illustrates why Bausch's style is relevant today rather than explaining how it was shaped."
