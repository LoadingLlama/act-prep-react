Chapter 7: Algebra Skills
Many ACT questions test your core algebra skills. To answer these questions correctly, we need to be able to
isolate an unknown such as x or y or solve an equation. For any algebra question, be sure to take your time,
write out each step of the question, and use the calculator to avoid silly mistakes like making a mental math
error or forgetting a negative sign.

In this section, we will cover the algebra skills that you will need in your toolbox for test day.

1. PEMDAS
In algebra, order of operations is critical to solving math questions correctly. PEMDAS 1s an acronym to help
you remember the order of operations in algebra. The rules of PEMDAS are below:
1.

P-— Parentheses: Complete any calculations inside parentheses first.

2.

E-—Exponents: Next, complete any exponents or square roots.

3.

MD-— Multiplication and Division: Complete any multiplication and division (left-to-right)

4.

AS-— Addition and Subtraction: Complete any addition and subtraction (left-to-right)

Make sure you do the multiplication and division step left-to right! This is where the ACT most often tries
to trick students. For example, if we are given
16+4x2-—3

We need to work left-to-right when completing multiplication and division. If solved correctly, we will start
by dividing 16 by 4 and then multiply by 2. Once we complete the multiplication and division, we will
subtract 3.
Correct: 16+4xX2—-3 =4x2-3 =8-3 =5
Many students make the mistake of doing the multiplication first and then dividing.
Incorrect:

16+4x2—3 = 16+8-3 = 2-3 =-1

Example 1: What is the value of the expression 22 + (—4)? +2 x (5+ 10)?
A.

285

B.

142

C.

120

D. 72

Solution: First, complete any calculations in parentheses.

22 + (—4)?+2x15
Next, complete the exponents.
22+16+2x15

Complete any multiplication and division from left-to-right.
22+16+2xX15= 22+8x15=22+4+120
Finally, complete the addition.
22 +120 = 142

The answer is B. As long as you follow the PEMDAS steps correctly and work left-to-right correctly, these
questions should be easy!
Shortcut Solution — Use Your Calculator: You can also enter these questions directly into your calculator.
Your calculator is programed to do PEMDAS correctly, so as long as you enter the equation correctly, the
calculator will just tell you the answer. It’s that easy!

2. Negative Numbers
The ACT really really really loves questions with negative numbers. These questions are a prime place where

students make simple mistakes by not knowing how to properly do algebra with negative numbers. Let’s
review where students most often make mistakes to make sure that you ace these questions on test day.

Subtracting Negative Numbers
You likely already know that when subtracting a negative number, the negative signs turn into a positive sign
and you add the numbers together. For example,
2—(-4)=24+4=6
That’s easy! The mistake students more often make is forgetting to distribute a negative sign to multiple
terms. For example, if you are solving
5x — (2x —5)
make sure to distribute the negative sign to both the 2x and the —5. Many students forget to distribute the
negative sign.

Incorrect: 5x — (2x —5) = 5x-—2x-5= 3x—5
Correct: 5x — (2x —5) = 5x-—2x—(—5) = 3x4+5
Example 2: Which of the following expressions is equivalent to 2(a + b) — 3(a — 4b) ?

A. —a+14b B. —a + 6b C. —a— 3b D. —a — 9b

G)

Solution: Distribute the —3 to both the a and —4b and combine like terms.

2(a+ b)—3(a—4b) = 2a+ 2b — 3a — 3(-4b) = 2a+ 2b—-—3a+12b = -—a+14b
The answer is A.

Negative Numbers and Exponents
The second common mistake occurs when negative numbers are raised to a power. The important thing to
understand is

—2? is not the same as (—2)?
For —2?, you first square the 2 and then multiply by the negative sign. For (—2)?, you just square —2. Asa
result, we see

—2? = -4
(-2)? = 4
This principle is very important to understand and can be tested on more difficult ACT questions. Make sure
you always put negative numbers in parentheses when you enter them into your calculator! If you do not
use the parentheses, you will get the wrong answer.

Example 3: If x is a real number such that —x? < 0, which of the following must be true?
A.

x

#0

B.

x >0

C.x <0

D.
x 20

Solution — “Math Teacher Way”: The negative sign is not in parentheses, so we need to do the exponent

first and then multiply by the negative sign. In order for —x? to be negative, x? must be positive. For x? to be

positive, x must be positive. x cannot equal 0 since —0? = 0. The answer is B.

math

Shortcut Solution — Substitution: For conceptual math questions like this, it is easiest to pick test numbers,
plug them into the equation, and see if they work or not. Here, let’s try x = —2, x = 0, and x = 2.

Forx = —2,-(—2)? = -(-8) = 8
For x = 0, —(0)? = 0
Forx = 2,-(2)? = —(8) = -8
The only value that gave a number less than 0 is x = 2, so the answer is B.

3. Combining Like Terms
Whenever you have the chance, you should combine like terms. Doing so will help you simplify the equation
and get to the correct answer more quickly.

Example 4: If 2(3x — 6) + 3y = 6x — y + 8, what is the value of y?
A.

5

B.

3

C.

1

D.

-1

Solution: First, distribute the 2 on the left side of the equation.
6x —12+3y =6x-—y+8

We have x and y terms on both sides of the equation, so we need to combine like terms. Here, the 6x terms on
both sides cancel, so we get
—12+3y=-y+8

Now, combine the y-terms and the numbers and solve. Add y and 12 to both sides to get.
Ay = 20

y=5
The answer is A.

4. Cross Multiply Fractions
Whenever you have two fractions equal to one another, we can cross multiply to get rid of the fractions.
xy

Z

Cross multiplying, we get

Ww

xwW = yz

Example 5: If = = - , what is the value of x?

A=

B448

5. Square Both Sides of an Equation Correctly
In algebra questions with square roots, you often need to square both sides to get rid of the square root. It is
important to remember that you need to square both sides and not just each individual term. Students will
often make a mistake on a question like the example below.

Example 6:

Vx =x-2

What value(s) of x solve the equation above?
A.

1

B.

4

C.

2

D.

1,4

Solution: When we see the x under the square root in this question, we start by squaring both sides of the
equation. Most students will properly get rid of the square root on the left side of the equation, but they make
a mistake on the right side by doing this:

x=x?-4
WRONG! We cannot just square each individual term. We must square the entire equation on each
side, so it should look like this:

(vx)? = (x — 2)?
If you prefer, you can also write out the right side of the equation like this to help make sure you remember to
properly expand the expression.

(Vx)? = (x — 2)(x — 2)
If we properly square both sides of the equation, we get

x=x*-4Ax+4
From here, we can combine like terms, set the equation equal to zero, and factor. Moving all of the terms to
the right side, we get

O0=x*-—5x4+4
0= (x-4)(x-1)
x=1,4

It looks like there are two answers to this question, but that is not the case! Anytime you square both sides of
an equation, you NEED to plug the answers back into the original equation to look for extraneous

solutions. Sometimes when you square both sides of an equation, you get fake answers that look correct but
do not actually work. Let’s start by checking x = 1.

v1=1-2
14-1

We see that x = 1 does not work in the original equation, so it is an extraneous solution. Now, we can check
x=4.

V4=4-2
2=2

We find that x = 4 works in the original equation, so the answer is B.
Shortcut solution — Backsolve: We can backsolve this question using the answer choices. By plugging the
answer choices in of 1, 2, and 4 in for x, we can test each answer choice. Only 4 works, so the answer is B.
Test-Taking Tip: Whenever you see a question like this, you should just plug the answer choices back

in. It is much faster and easier than solving out algebraically!

6. Algebra with Inequality Signs
To solve inequalities on the ACT, treat the inequality signs (<,>,<, =) like an = sign and solve using
algebra. Inequalities can be solved as normal algebraic expressions with the exception of one very important
rule:
When multiplying or dividing by a negative number, switch the direction of the inequality sign.

This rule is the most important thing to remember from this section and where students most commonly make

mistakes on inequalities questions. As a quick example, let’s see how to solve the equation below.
—5x-3>11
—5x
> 14

When dividing by —5, we switch the direction inequality sign, so
14

x<>
5

Let’s see a second example:
5x +10 < 2x — 44
The first step is combining like terms. We subtract 2x from both sides to get the x-terms on the left side. We

then subtract 10 from both sides to get the numbers on the right side.
5x — 2x < —44—10
3x
< —54

x<—2
3
x<-18

In this example, we never multiply or divide by a negative number, so the inequality sign stays the same. Just

because we are working with a negative number does not mean we need to flip the inequality sign. Some
students flip the sign whenever they divide and see a negative sign. Don’t make that mistake! Only flip the
inequality when you multiply or divide both sides by a negative number.
Example 7: Which of the following inequalities 1s equivalent to 2x — 6y < 4x — 14?

A.

x > 6y — 14

B.

x >3y—7

C.x<—-3y+7

D.

x > -3y+7

Solution: To solve, we need to isolate x. We need to do this because all the answer choices have x isolated
on the left side of the equation. To isolate x, we need to move the x-terms to the left side and all other terms to
the right side. To do this, we need to subtract 4x from both sides and add 6y to both sides.
2x —6y < 4x — 14
2x —4x < 6y — 14
—2x
< 6y— 14

To get x by itself, we need to divide both sides by —2. Since we are dividing by a negative, we also need to
switch the direction of the inequality sign.
x>

6y — 14
—2

Now, we can simplify the terms on the night side of the equation and solve.
x>—-3y+7
The answer is D.

7. Taking Square Roots in Algebraic Equations
When solving an algebra question, you may need to find the value of a variable that is squared. For example,
if we have the equation

x2 =9
we need to take the square root of both sides to solve. Many students take the square root and get x = 3,
which is WRONG! To take the square root properly, we need to use the following rule

When taking the square root of a squared variable (x*), add a + in front of the number.
For the example equation above, we should solve using the following steps to solve properly.

x? =9
[x2

1. Take square root of both sides.

= +9

2. Adda +

y= 43

sign in front of the number.

3. Simplify

x = —-3,3

Notice that we get 2 answers! This makes sense because both (—3)? and 3? equal 9.
Now, it is important to clarify that this only applies to taking the square root of algebraic equations with

squared terms, like x*. You do not add a + sign when taking the square root of only a number.

Correct: /9 = 3

Incorrect: /9 = +3

The square root of 9 is only 3, not +3. Square roots are always positive. Understanding this difference is
important for solving questions involving square roots and variables correctly.

Example 8: What value(s) of x are solutions to the equation x? + 10 = 46?

A. —6 B. 6 C. 0,6 D. —6,6

Solution: When solving an equation with an x* term and numbers, start by getting the x? term on one side by
itself. To do that, we need to subtract 10 from both sides.

x? +10
= 46
x?
= 36

Now, we can take the square root of both sides. Since we are taking the square root with an x? term, we need
to add a + sign in front of the number.

Vx?

= +vV36

x = +6
x =-6,6

The correct answer is D.
