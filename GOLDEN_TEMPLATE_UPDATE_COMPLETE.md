---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. Golden Template Updated to v5.0 (Math-Specific)

**Location:** `/docs/templates/GOLDEN_TEMPLATE_MATH.md`

**Major Changes:**

#### A. Flexible H3 Sections (NOT Fixed)
- ‚ùå OLD: "Exactly 4 H3 sections"
- ‚úÖ NEW: "Flexible number based on concepts (typically 2-5)"
- Reasoning: Lessons should adapt to content, not force content into structure

#### B. Removed Mastery Quizzes
- ‚ùå OLD: Mastery quiz at position 11 at end of lesson
- ‚úÖ NEW: NO mastery quizzes in math lessons
- Complete removal from template, scripts, and quality checklist

#### C. Math-Specific Requirements
- **Answer Choices:** Always 5 options (A-E) for math
- **Note:** English/Reading/Science use 4 choices (documented difference)
- Math-specific example scripts with 5-choice structure

#### D. Enhanced Content Requirements
- **Intro:** EXACTLY 2 sentences (strictly enforced)
- **Content:** Bullet points with 2-3 indent levels (NO paragraphs)
- **Glossary Terms:** 3-6 max per lesson (sparse usage)
- **Key Takeaways:** EXACTLY 4 (no more, no less)

#### E. New Mathematical Standards
- **Notation Guide:** Unicode symbols (‚àö, œÄ, ¬≤, ¬≥, ¬±, ‚âà, ‚â†, ‚â§, ‚â•, ‚àû, ¬∞)
- **Formula Formatting:** Clear inline and emphasized formula examples
- **Calculator Tips:** When to use calculator vs. mental math
- **Special Characters:** Proper mathematical symbol usage

#### F. Database & Structure
- **Table:** `lesson_term_definitions` (not `glossary_terms`)
- **Examples Table:** 5 choices for math (position after H3 sections)
- **No Quiz Tables:** Removed all mastery quiz references

### 2. Math 1.1 (Backsolving) Restructured

**Location:** Supabase `lessons` table, lesson_key: `backsolving`

**Changes Made:**

#### A. Intro Reduced to 2 Sentences
- **OLD:** 91-word opening paragraph with 3 glossary terms
- **NEW:** 2 sentences, no glossary terms in intro
```
"The working backwards strategy is one of the most powerful time-saving techniques
on the ACT Math section, letting you test answer choices instead of solving
algebraically. This strategy works on 8-12 questions per test‚Äîthat's 13-20% of
all math questions!"
```

#### B. Content Converted to Bullet Points
- **OLD:** Long paragraphs (40-60 words each)
- **NEW:** Concise bullet points with 2-3 indent levels
- Easier to scan, more digestible
- Clear hierarchy of information

#### C. Glossary Terms Reduced & Created
- **OLD:** 3 terms in intro, more throughout (not in database)
- **NEW:** 3 terms total, ALL in database:
  1. `backsolving` - "A problem-solving strategy where you test answer choices..."
  2. `working backwards` - "Another name for backsolving..."
  3. `middle value strategy` - "Starting with answer choice B or C..."
- Hover tooltips now work correctly

#### D. H3 Sections: 4 (Appropriate for This Lesson)
1. What Is Backsolving?
2. The Strategic Backsolving Process
3. Perfect Scenarios for Backsolving
4. When NOT to Backsolve

*(Note: 4 is appropriate here‚Äîother lessons may have 2, 3, or 5 depending on content)*

#### E. Key Takeaways: Exactly 4
- ‚úì Main strategy explanation
- ‚úì Middle value strategy usage
- ‚úì Perfect scenarios
- ‚úì When to avoid

#### F. Content Size
- **Before:** 13,709 characters (v3.0 template)
- **After:** 11,691 characters (v5.0 template)
- More concise, easier to read

### 3. Glossary Terms Created in Database

**Table:** `lesson_term_definitions`

| Term | Definition | Lesson Key |
|------|------------|------------|
| backsolving | A problem-solving strategy where you test answer choices by plugging them into the problem conditions instead of solving algebraically. | backsolving |
| working backwards | Another name for backsolving; starting with the answer choices and testing which one satisfies all problem conditions. | backsolving |
| middle value strategy | Starting with answer choice B or C (the middle values) when backsolving, which allows you to eliminate multiple choices with a single test. | backsolving |

**Status:** ‚úÖ All created and verified in Supabase
