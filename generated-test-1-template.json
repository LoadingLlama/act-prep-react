        "passage_text": "He met her, my mother, in New York City, and the Heart said plaintively: Thump thump thump. That was not the sound of illness. Theirs was an auspicious meeting, although no one had troubled to check the alignment of the stars; the young woman was twenty-seven—old for a prospective bride—but she was studying for a master's degree in chemistry.\n\nHe took her home. She boarded with a family in Brooklyn. During the car ride they were silent. It was a strange and comfortable silence for two people who had waited for so long to be alone. The thrum of the motor was loud because the car was old. When they turned the corner he pulled over. \"Here,\" he said. And having delivered her he waited in the car until she had opened the door and gone inside.\n\nThe space they inhabited, their New York, had a gentle anonymity. They moved through it like two needles through silk, barely disturbing its fabric. And when they stopped for tea or talked while sitting on a park bench, they were unremarkable. No one knew them. No one looked twice at a young Tamil couple. They could have been anybody. In the evenings he dropped her off at her lodgings and said good-bye. After the door closed behind them the space between their rooms—his apartment on the other side of the city—felt very wide. They talked on the telephone. They went to dinner. They fell in love.\n\nThey married. The wedding was small and quick. They sent wedding announcements home. The photographs that accompanied the announcements were formal. In them she is dressed in a silk sari, he in a suit. They are standing very straight, and there is space between them, which was how it was supposed to be. They are looking away from each other and into the camera. But in one photograph, slipped in with the more proper ones sent home, they are looking at each other and laughing. This was their secret.\n\nAfter they married, they moved to a new apartment. It was in a tall building, and from their window they could see other buildings, the city spread below them in lights. At night the view made my mother think of stars, and she would stand by the window, looking down at all those lights and thinking of their distance from home. My father was proud of the apartment. He was proud of the furniture they had bought, the dishes they ate from, the life they were making.\n\nOne day my mother announced that she was pregnant. My father received this news with joy. He had been preparing for it. He had been saving money, making plans, imagining a future. This child—me—would be American. I would be born here and would belong in a way that my parents, who had come here as adults, never quite could. I would be part of this place. That was what they wanted.",

        "passage_text": "Passage A\n\nIf humans were truly at home under the light of the moon and stars, we would go in darkness happily, the midnight world as visible to us as it is to the vast number of nocturnal species on this planet. Instead, we are diurnal creatures, with eyes adapted to living in the sun's light. This is a basic evolutionary fact, even though most of us don't think of ourselves as diurnal beings any more than we think of ourselves as primates or mammals or Earthlings. Yet it's the only way to explain what we've done to the night: We've engineered it to receive us by filling it with light.\n\nThis kind of engineering is no different from damming a river. Its benefits come with consequences—called light pollution—whose effects scientists are only now beginning to study. Light pollution is largely the result of bad lighting design, which allows artificial light to shine outward and upward into the sky, where it's not wanted, instead of focusing it downward, where it is. Wherever human light spills into the natural world, some aspect of life—migration, reproduction, feeding—is affected, and not for the better.\n\nMost cities have never been darker, in the sense of having less exposure to natural darkness, and so today's children in urban areas are growing up largely blind to the stars and planets. We've become so used to the glow of light pollution that we may not even miss the darkness when it's gone. But the ecological and human health consequences of disrupting natural patterns of light and dark are real.\n\nPassage B\n\nI worry we are rapidly losing night's natural darkness before realizing its worth. For those of us living in cities and suburbs, it has been lost already. We have forgotten what real darkness is like. We have forgotten what we are missing.\n\nBut it's not too late. The  decision to keep our night skies dark is not some abstract scientific or environmental issue—this is about our human heritage, our quality of life, and our cultural connection to the universe. To see the Milky Way draped across the sky is to realize our place in the cosmos—it's our home galaxy, visible from the surface of our home planet.\n\nAstronomers divide darkness into categories. \"Truly dark sky\" means you can see the Milky Way in detail. But near cities, sky glow brightens the night, and the Milky Way becomes difficult or impossible to see. Studies show that two-thirds of Americans and Europeans no longer experience truly dark skies. More than 99 percent of people living in the United States and Europe experience light-polluted skies.\n\nWhat we lose when we lose darkness is hard to measure but easy to experience. Stand under a dark sky and look up. Give your eyes time to adjust—the cones and rods need time to become sensitive. After twenty minutes or so, the stars begin to emerge, more and more of them, until the sky is full. This is our natural birthright: a sky filled with stars and the arc of the Milky Way, our home in the universe made visible.",

        "passage_text": "I have always been fascinated by the way we remember places. When I think of my childhood home, I don't see it as it actually was—I see fragments, pieces of rooms, the way light fell through a particular window, the sound of the furnace clicking on in winter. My memories are a patchwork, incomplete but somehow more meaningful than a perfect reproduction could ever be.\n\nThis is what drew me to photography. A photograph can capture a moment, freeze it in time, but it can never capture the fullness of experience. It can't capture the smell of pine trees on a summer day, the feeling of cold water on your feet, the way your heart races when you're standing at the edge of a cliff. These things exist in memory, not in images.\n\nBut photographs do something else: they shape our memories. Once you've taken a photograph of a place, that image becomes part of how you remember it. The photograph replaces the memory, or at least influences it. You remember the composition, the frame, what was included and what was left out. In this way, photographs are both documents of experience and filters through which we reconstruct the past.\n\nIn my work, I'm interested in exploring this relationship between place, photography, and memory. I create images that are deliberately incomplete, that suggest rather than describe. I want viewers to fill in the gaps with their own memories, their own experiences of place. A photograph of a forest might show only fragments—shafts of light, the texture of bark, shadows on the ground. The viewer has to assemble these pieces into something coherent, just as we assemble our memories from fragments.\n\nThis approach is rooted in the understanding that memory is inherently subjective and personal. No two people remember the same event or place in exactly the same way. Our memories are colored by our emotions, our past experiences, our expectations. They change over time, growing more vivid or fading away entirely. They are unreliable narrators of our own lives.\n\nPhotography, despite its reputation for objectivity, is equally subjective. Every photograph is shaped by countless decisions: where to stand, what to include in the frame, when to press the shutter, how to process the image afterward. These decisions reflect the photographer's perspective, their interpretation of the scene. In this sense, a photograph is never just a document—it's an argument, a point of view.\n\nWhat interests me most is the space between the photograph and the memory, between what the image shows and what it suggests. This space is where meaning is made, where the viewer brings their own experience to bear on what they see. It's an active process, a collaboration between artist and audience. The photograph is not complete until someone looks at it and completes it with their own memories, their own understanding of place.",

        "introduction": "This passage is adapted from an article about glaciers and their role in Earth's climate system.",
        "passage_text": "Glaciers are massive bodies of ice that form over many years from compressed snow. They exist on every continent except Australia, though the vast majority of the world's ice is contained in the ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland. Despite their solid appearance, glaciers are constantly in motion, flowing slowly downhill under their own weight like rivers of ice.\n\nThe formation of a glacier begins when snow accumulates faster than it melts. Over time, the weight of new snow compresses the layers beneath it, squeezing out the air and transforming the snow into dense ice. This process can take decades or even centuries, depending on the climate and location. Once the ice becomes thick enough—typically about 100 feet—gravity causes it to begin flowing downhill.\n\nGlaciers play a crucial role in Earth's climate system and have a significant impact on global sea levels. They act as frozen reservoirs, storing approximately 69 percent of the world's fresh water. When glaciers grow, they lock up water that would otherwise be in the ocean, causing sea levels to drop. When they melt, they release this water back into the sea, causing sea levels to rise.\n\nScientists study glaciers to understand past climate conditions and to predict future changes. Ice cores drilled from glaciers contain layers of ice that correspond to different time periods, much like tree rings. By analyzing these layers, scientists can determine past temperatures, atmospheric composition, and even the presence of volcanic eruptions. Some ice cores contain records going back hundreds of thousands of years.\n\nIn recent decades, glaciers around the world have been retreating at an accelerating rate. Measurements show that glaciers in Alaska, Greenland, Asia, and the Alps are losing mass faster than they are gaining it. This retreat is primarily attributed to rising global temperatures caused by human activities. As glaciers melt, they contribute to sea level rise, which threatens coastal communities around the world.\n\nThe loss of glaciers also affects freshwater availability. In many regions, particularly in South America and Asia, glaciers feed rivers that provide water for millions of people. As these glaciers shrink, the rivers they feed may experience reduced flow, especially during dry seasons when glacier meltwater is most needed. This could lead to water shortages and conflicts over water resources.\n\nBeyond their practical importance, glaciers hold an aesthetic and cultural significance. They have inspired artists, writers, and explorers for centuries. The sight of a massive glacier calving—breaking off large chunks of ice into the sea—is both beautiful and sobering, a reminder of the power of natural forces and the changes happening to our planet.",

Each fly was placed in a separate enclosure containing Escherichia coli (a type of bacteria) and allowed to walk on the E. coli for 5 min.\n2. Each fly was then immediately placed in a separate petri dish containing sterile nutrient agar. Five minutes later, the flies were removed from the dishes.\n3. The dishes were incubated at 37°C for 24 hr so that each E. coli cell on the dish divided to form a separate colony, and then the number of E. coli colonies on each dish was counted. The results are shown in Figure 1.\n\n**Experiment 2**\nThe procedure from Experiment 1 was repeated with each of 3 groups of 10 S. carnaria except that the flies in each group were allowed to walk on the E. coli for a different period of time—5 min, 30 min, or 60 min—before each fly was placed in a separate petri dish containing nutrient agar. The results are shown in Figure 2.\n\n**Experiment 3**\nThe procedure from Experiment 1 was repeated with each of 3 groups of 10 S. carnaria except that, after Step 1, the flies in each group were allowed a different period of time—0 min, 30 min, or 60 min—to clean themselves before each fly was placed in a separate petri dish containing sterile nutrient agar.

        "passage_text": "Four students observed that in a population of land plants, Population A, a plant could have a green stem or a purple stem. Each student proposed an explanation for this observation.\n\nStudent 1\nAll plants in Population A produce the green pigment chlorophyll. If a plant receives 8 hr or more of sunlight each day, it also produces a purple pigment, causing its stem to be purple. If a plant receives less than 8 hr of sunlight each day, it does not produce this purple pigment, so its stem is green. All plants in Population A are genetically identical, so they all have the ability to produce both pigments.\n\nStudent 2\nAll plants in Population A produce the green pigment chlorophyll. If a plant receives too little phosphorus (a nutrient), it also produces a purple pigment, causing its stem to be purple. If a plant receives enough phosphorus, it does not produce this purple pigment, so its stem is green. All plants in Population A are genetically identical, so they all have the ability to produce both pigments. The amount of sunlight received by a plant does not affect stem color.\n\nStudent 3\nAll plants in Population A produce the green pigment chlorophyll. The production of purple pigment is determined by Gene Q, which has 2 alleles (Q and q) and 3 possible genotypes (QQ, Qq, and qq). A plant with either the Gene Q genotype QQ or the Gene Q genotype Qq produces the purple pigment, causing its stem to be purple. A plant with the Gene Q genotype qq does not produce this purple pigment, so its stem is green. The amount of sunlight or nutrients received by a plant does not affect stem color.\n\nStudent 4\nAll plants in Population A produce the green pigment chlorophyll. The production of purple pigment is determined by Gene Q, which has 2 alleles (Q and q) and 3 possible genotypes (QQ, Qq, and qq). A plant with the Gene Q genotype qq produces the purple pigment, causing its stem to be purple.

A tank fitted with 2 electrodes—an anode (where O₂ would be produced) and a cathode (where H₂ would be produced)—was assembled. Each electrode was suspended in an inverted plastic tube, and each tube was marked to allow gas volume to be measured.\n\n2. Four liters (4.0 L) of a 25% by mass aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was added to the tank. As a result, the tubes were completely filled with the solution.\n\n3. At 8:00 a.m., a rectangular solar cell was attached to the electrodes and placed next to a particular south-facing window for 8 hr.\n\n4. Eight hours later, the solar cell was detached from the electrodes, and the amount of H₂ that had been produced was measured.\n\n5. The tank, tubes, and electrodes were cleaned and dried for reuse.",

Each harmonic has a characteristic number of nodes: locations between the ends of the string that do not move (the ends of the string do not count as nodes).\n\nA string having a mass per unit length of μ was attached on one end to an oscillator (a motor that vibrates) and on the other end to a pulley and ratchet. The student could select the frequency, f (the number of cycles per second), of the oscillator's vibration. By cranking the ratchet, the student could vary the force of tension, T, in the string.\n\nExperiment 1\nWith 0.10 newtons (N) of tension in String X (μ = 0.02 g/cm), the student varied f. She noted that standing waves occurred only at certain values of f. The student sketched the first 5 harmonics and recorded f (in hertz, Hz) for each. She repeated this procedure for String Y (μ = 0.08 g/cm) and for String Z (μ = 0.16 g/cm).\n\nExperiment 2\nBeginning again with String X, the student set the oscillator to vibrate at f = 25.0 Hz. She then varied T, and noted that standing waves occurred only at certain values of T. The student recorded T for the first 5 harmonics. She repeated this procedure for Strings Y and Z.",
