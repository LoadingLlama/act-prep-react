      <h3>Transform Your ACT Journey Into Academic Success</h3>
      <p>The ACT represents far more than a standardized test—it's your gateway to demonstrating academic excellence and securing educational opportunities. This comprehensive assessment evaluates your mastery across four critical academic pillars: English proficiency, mathematical reasoning, reading comprehension, and scientific analysis. Through strategic preparation, you'll transform this academic challenge into your most powerful competitive advantage.</p>

      <h3>Mastering the ACT Architecture</h3>
      <p>The ACT examination features four precisely structured sections, each engineered to assess distinct academic capabilities:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>English Mastery (45 minutes, 75 questions):</strong> Tests grammar mastery, usage proficiency, punctuation precision, and rhetorical sophistication</li>
          <li><strong>Mathematical Reasoning (60 minutes, 60 questions):</strong> Assesses algebraic fluency, geometric understanding, and trigonometric problem-solving</li>
          <li><strong>Reading Excellence (35 minutes, 40 questions):</strong> Evaluates comprehension mastery and analytical reasoning across varied academic passages</li>
          <li><strong>Scientific Analysis (35 minutes, 40 questions):</strong> Measures data interpretation abilities and scientific reasoning prowess</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Understanding Your Score Potential</h3>
      <p>Each section generates a scaled score ranging from 1 to 36 points. Your composite score represents the average of these four section scores. While most colleges accept scores above 20, elite institutions typically require composite scores of 30 or higher for competitive admission consideration.</p>

      <h3>Your Elite Preparation Strategy</h3>
      <p>Championship-level test preparation requires a systematic approach incorporating:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Thorough diagnostic assessment to identify performance strengths and targeted improvement areas</li>
          <li>Strategic time investment focusing on sections with maximum score enhancement potential</li>
          <li>Section-specific tactical methodologies and optimized time management techniques</li>
          <li>Consistent full-length practice testing to build endurance and test-day confidence</li>
          <li>Comprehensive error analysis to master correct reasoning approaches</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Core principle: Methodical, consistent preparation significantly outperforms cramming. Prioritize your weakest areas while systematically strengthening all sections for maximum score improvement.</p>

            <h3>Why Sentence Structure Dominates the ACT</h3>
            <p>Every ACT English test features 12-18 sentence structure questions. Test makers evaluate your ability to distinguish complete thoughts from incomplete ones and connect them effectively.</p>

            <h3>Essential Foundation: Recognizing Sentence Components</h3>
            <p>Before mastering ACT questions, you must identify the two fundamental sentence types. Each requires a subject (who/what) and a predicate (action/description):</p>

                </div>

                <p>Independent clauses represent complete ideas capable of standing alone as sentences. They contain both subject and predicate while expressing finished thoughts.</p>

                <h4>Phrases: The Supporting Elements</h4>
                <p>A <strong>phrase</strong> lacks either a subject or predicate (or both). These function as supporting details rather than complete thoughts, adding information without creating sentences independently.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples of incomplete phrases:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Running toward the finish line... (who is running?)</li>
                    <li>Creating comprehensive study schedules... (who is creating?)</li>
                    <li>Reviewing it carefully... (who reviewed what?)</li>
                    <li>Determined to achieve success... (who is determined?)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>Simple Completeness Test</h4>
                <p>Use this reliable method: Read each part aloud. If it feels natural to stop reading, you have an independent clause. If you feel compelled to continue, it's either dependent or just a phrase.</p>
                <p>For dependent vs. phrase distinction: Cover the opening word and read the remainder. If it becomes complete, you had a dependent clause. If still incomplete, it was merely a phrase.</p>
                <p><strong>Practice examples:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Complete thought:</strong> My study partner reviews concepts daily.</li>
                    <li><strong>Needs completion:</strong> When my study partner reviews concepts daily...</li>
                    <li><strong>Missing elements:</strong> Reviewing concepts daily...</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Correcting Incomplete Sentences</h3>
            <p>Sometimes sentences fail because they lack essential components. <strong>Sentence fragments</strong> resemble broken mechanisms - they lack necessary parts to function properly.</p>
            <p>Your instincts often detect these because they sound unnatural. Trust your ear for what sounds complete!</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Broken:</strong> The student rushing to complete the assignment. <em>(What did the student DO?)</em></p>
                <p><strong>Fixed:</strong> The student rushing to complete the assignment submitted it early.</p>
                <p><strong>Broken:</strong> Determined to excel on the exam. <em>(WHO is determined?)</em></p>
                <p><strong>Fixed:</strong> My classmate Sarah is determined to excel on the exam.</p>

    <p>From Chapter 1, you've already mastered 2 of the 4 comma types. Let's connect them to your new knowledge:</p>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4><span style="color: #22c55e; font-weight: 600;">Type 1: FANBOYS Comma</span> (From Golden Rule #2)</h4>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Perfect Example:</strong> <span class="independent-highlight">Sarah loves chocolate</span><strong>,</strong> <strong>but</strong> <span class="independent-highlight">Andrew prefers vanilla.</span></p>
            <p><em>Why this works: Two <span class="independent-highlight">complete thoughts</span> joined with comma + connecting word</em></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4><span style="color: #22c55e; font-weight: 600;">Type 2: Introductory Comma</span> (From Golden Rule #4)</h4>
        <p><strong>Pattern:</strong> <span class="dependent-highlight">Dependent clause</span><strong>,</strong> <span class="independent-highlight">independent clause</span></p>
        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Perfect Example:</strong> <span class="dependent-highlight">When the bell rang</span><strong>,</strong> <span class="independent-highlight">students rushed to lunch.</span></p>

        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>New Learning: The Final Two Comma Types</h3>
    <p>These next two comma types handle all the remaining comma situations on the ACT:</p>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4><span style="color: #f59e0b; font-weight: 600;">Type 3: Unnecessary Information Commas</span></h4>
        <p><strong>The Rule:</strong> Extra information that interrupts the main sentence gets surrounded by commas</p>
        <p><strong>The Test:</strong> Can you remove the information and still have a complete sentence? If yes, it needs commas!</p>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Perfect Examples:</strong></p>
            <p>Mrs. Johnson<strong>,</strong> who teaches chemistry<strong>,</strong> assigns homework daily.</p>
            <p><em>Remove "who teaches chemistry" → "Mrs. Johnson assigns homework daily" ✓ Still complete!</em></p>

            <p>The movie<strong>,</strong> surprisingly<strong>,</strong> ended with a cliffhanger.</p>
            <p><em>Remove "surprisingly" → "The movie ended with a cliffhanger" ✓ Still complete!</em></p>

            <p>My brother<strong>,</strong> the one with curly hair<strong>,</strong> plays guitar.</p>
            <p><em>Remove "the one with curly hair" → "My brother plays guitar" ✓ Still complete!</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="pro-tip">
            <h4>🎯 PRO TIP: The Cross-Out Test</h4>
            <p>Cover the suspected unnecessary information with your fingers. If the sentence still makes perfect sense, it's unnecessary and needs commas!</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4><span style="color: #f59e0b; font-weight: 600;">Type 4: List Commas</span></h4>
        <p><strong>The Rule:</strong> Separate items in a series of 3 or more things</p>
        <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> The comma before "and" is <em>always required</em> on the ACT!</p>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Perfect Examples:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Things:</strong> I need pencils<strong>,</strong> paper<strong>,</strong> and erasers.</p>
            <p><strong>Actions:</strong> She ran<strong>,</strong> jumped<strong>,</strong> and landed safely.</p>
            <p><strong>Describing words:</strong> The tall<strong>,</strong> dark<strong>,</strong> mysterious stranger arrived.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="pro-tip">
            <h4>🔍 Special Case: Two Adjectives Test</h4>
            <p>For describing words, try switching their order. If it still sounds right, use a comma:</p>
            <p>✅ "Dark, mysterious" = "Mysterious, dark" (both sound good → use comma)</p>
            <p>❌ "Red sports" ≠ "Sports red" (sounds wrong → no comma)</p>

    <h3>Master Strategy: Your 4-Step Comma Decision Process</h3>
    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>When You See a Comma Question on the ACT:</h4>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Look for FANBOYS words (and, but, so, etc.)</p>
        <p>→ If found: Check if you have independent clause + comma + FANBOYS + independent clause</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Look for subordinating words (when, because, although, etc.)</p>
        <p>→ If found: Check if dependent clause comes first and needs comma before independent clause</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Try the cross-out test</p>
        <p>→ If you can remove information and sentence is still complete: Use unnecessary information commas</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Count items in a list</p>
        <p>→ If 3+ items: Use list commas (don't forget comma before "and"!)</p>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>💡 Core Truth About Semicolons</h4>
        <p>A semicolon is <strong>stronger than a comma but weaker than a period</strong>. It connects ideas that are <em>very closely related</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Rule:</strong> Both sides of a semicolon must be <span >independent clauses</span> (remember Chapter 1!)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>📋 Semicolon Rule #1: Joining Related Independent Clauses</h4>
        <p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Independent clause<strong>;</strong> independent clause</p>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Perfect Examples:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>✅ Correct:</strong> Sarah studied for hours<strong>;</strong> she was ready for the test.</p>
            <p><em>Why it works: Both sides are complete thoughts, and the second explains the result of the first.</em></p>

            <p><strong>✅ Also correct:</strong> The storm was intense<strong>;</strong> however, we continued our hike.</p>
            <p><em>Why it works: "However" is a transitional word, not a FANBOYS conjunction.</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Common Mistakes:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>❌ Wrong:</strong> Sarah studied for hours<strong>,</strong> she was ready for the test.</p>
            <p><em>Problem: Comma splice! You can't join two independent clauses with just a comma.</em></p>

            <p><strong>❌ Wrong:</strong> Sarah studied for hours<strong>;</strong> and was ready for the test.</p>
            <p><em>Problem: "and was ready" is not an independent clause (no subject!).</em></p>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>📋 Semicolon Rule #2: Super Lists (When Commas Get Confusing)</h4>
        <p><strong>When to use:</strong> When list items already contain commas, use semicolons to separate the major items.</p>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Perfect Example:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>✅ Clear with semicolons:</strong> The debate included experts from Portland, Oregon<strong>;</strong> Austin, Texas<strong>;</strong> and Miami, Florida.</p>
            <p><strong>❌ Confusing with commas:</strong> The debate included experts from Portland, Oregon, Austin, Texas, and Miami, Florida.</p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="pro-tip">
        <h4>🎯 Semicolon Test Strategy</h4>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Cover the semicolon and read each side separately</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Ask "Is each side a complete sentence that could stand alone?"</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If both are complete AND closely related → semicolon works!</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> If there are commas within list items → semicolon needed for clarity</p>

    <h3>Part 3: Dashes - The Drama Queen</h3>

    <div class="concept-box">

        <p>Dashes create <strong>dramatic emphasis</strong> and can replace commas, parentheses, or colons when you want <em>extra attention</em> on something.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Dashes are more dramatic than commas but less formal than semicolons.</p>

            <p><strong>✅ Example:</strong> The weather was perfect for hiking<strong>—</strong>until the thunderstorm hit.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Use 2: Extra Emphasis (Instead of a Colon)</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Compare to colon:</strong> She had only one thing on her mind<strong>:</strong> winning the championship.</p>
            <p><em>The dash version feels more dramatic and immediate.</em></p>

        <p><strong>For possession:</strong> Ask "who owns what?" Then follow the rules: singular = 's, plural ending in s = '</p>
        <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Possessive pronouns (its, yours, hers, theirs) NEVER use apostrophes!</p>

    <h3>Part 5: Quotation Marks - The Speech Bubbles</h3>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>💡 Core Truth About Quotation Marks</h4>
        <p>Quotation marks capture <strong>exact words</strong> that someone spoke or wrote. They work like speech bubbles in comics!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>📋 The 3 Essential Quotation Rules</h4>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Rule 1: Comma Placement</strong></p>
            <p><strong>✅ Correct:</strong> "I love this book<strong>,</strong>" Sarah said.</p>
            <p><strong>❌ Wrong:</strong> "I love this book"<strong>,</strong> Sarah said.</p>
            <p><em>Commas and periods always go INSIDE the quotation marks!</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Rule 2: Question Marks and Exclamation Points</strong></p>
            <p><strong>If part of the quote:</strong> Sarah asked, "Are you coming<strong>?</strong>"</p>
            <p><strong>If not part of quote:</strong> Did Sarah say, "I'm leaving"<strong>?</strong></p>
            <p><em>These marks go inside if they belong to the quoted words, outside if they belong to the whole sentence.</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Rule 3: Capitalizing the First Word</strong></p>
            <p><strong>✅ Complete sentence quote:</strong> The teacher announced, "<strong>T</strong>he test is tomorrow."</p>
            <p><strong>✅ Partial quote:</strong> The teacher said the test would be "<strong>c</strong>hallenging but fair."</p>
            <p><em>Capitalize only if the quote is a complete sentence.</em></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="pro-tip">
        <h4>🎯 Quotation Mark Memory Trick</h4>
        <p><strong>Think "Protective Bubble":</strong> Quotation marks protect the exact words. Commas and periods want to stay close to the words they protect, so they go inside the bubble!</p>

    <h3>Chapter 3 Master Strategy: Your ACT Punctuation Decision Tree</h3>
    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>🎯 When You See Advanced Punctuation on the ACT:</h4>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Identify what you're looking at</p>
        <p>→ Two complete thoughts? Consider semicolon or dash</p>
        <p>→ Something being introduced? Consider colon or dash</p>
        <p>→ Ownership or contraction? Check apostrophes</p>
        <p>→ Exact spoken words? Check quotation marks</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Apply the specific rules</p>
        <p>→ Semicolon: Both sides must be independent clauses</p>
        <p>→ Colon: Before the colon must be independent clause</p>
        <p>→ Dash: Use for emphasis or interruption</p>
        <p>→ Apostrophe: Singular = 's, plural ending in s = '</p>
        <p>→ Quotes: Commas and periods go inside</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> When in doubt, use simpler punctuation</p>
        <p>→ Period instead of semicolon</p>
        <p>→ Comma instead of dash</p>
        <p>→ Simple sentences instead of complex punctuation</p>

    <h3>Step 1: The Universal Rule (It Never Changes!)</h3>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>💡 The Only Rule You Need to Know</h4>
        <p><strong>Singular subjects</strong> take <span >singular verbs</span></p>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>📋 The Basic Pattern Recognition</h4>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Singular = Add 's' to Verb</strong></p>
            <p><strong>✅ Correct:</strong> The <span >cat</span> <strong>runs</strong> quickly.</p>
            <p><strong>✅ Correct:</strong> <span >Sarah</span> <strong>studies</strong> every night.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: The Distractor Game - How ACT Hides Subjects</h3>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>💡 The ACT's Favorite Trick</h4>
        <p>The ACT <strong>separates subjects from verbs</strong> with distracting words to confuse you. Your job: <strong>ignore the distractors and find the real subject!</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>📋 Distractor Type 1: Prepositional Phrases (The Decoys)</h4>
        <p><strong>Rule:</strong> Subjects are <em>never</em> found inside prepositional phrases. Cross them out!</p>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>How to Handle Prepositional Phrases:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>✅ Step-by-step process:</strong></p>
            <p>Original: "The box <em>of chocolates</em> <strong>[is/are]</strong> on the table."</p>
            <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Cross out prepositional phrase: The box ~~of chocolates~~ <strong>[is/are]</strong> on the table.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Find the subject: <span >box</span> (singular)</p>
            <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose matching verb: The box <strong>is</strong> on the table. ✅</p>
        </div>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Common Prepositional Distractors:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> The students <em>in the hallway</em> <strong>are</strong> waiting.</p>
            <p>→ Subject: <span >students</span> (plural) → verb: <strong>are</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> The leader <em>of these groups</em> <strong>has</strong> arrived.</p>
            <p>→ Subject: <span >leader</span> (singular) → verb: <strong>has</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Each <em>of the players</em> <strong>wants</strong> to win.</p>
            <p>→ Subject: <span >Each</span> (singular!) → verb: <strong>wants</strong></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>📋 Distractor Type 2: Interrupting Phrases</h4>
        <p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Subject + <em>, interrupting information,</em> + verb</p>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Perfect Examples:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>✅ Correct:</strong> Sarah<strong>,</strong> <em>along with her friends</em><strong>,</strong> <strong>is</strong> coming to dinner.</p>
            <p>→ Real subject: <span >Sarah</span> (singular) → verb: <strong>is</strong></p>
            <p><em>"along with her friends" is just extra information!</em></p>

            <p><strong>✅ Correct:</strong> The books<strong>,</strong> <em>as well as the pen</em><strong>,</strong> <strong>are</strong> on the desk.</p>
            <p>→ Real subject: <span >books</span> (plural) → verb: <strong>are</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Interrupting Phrase Warning Signs:</strong></p>
            <p>• along with • as well as • together with • in addition to</p>
            <p>• including • except • besides • rather than</p>
            <p><strong>All of these create interrupting phrases—ignore them for subject-verb agreement!</strong></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="pro-tip">
        <h4>🎯 The Cross-Out Strategy</h4>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Cross out everything between commas</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Cross out all prepositional phrases</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> What's left is your true subject and verb!</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Special Subject Types (The Tricky Ones)</h3>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>📋 Type 1: Compound Subjects</h4>
        <p>When you have multiple subjects, the connector word determines if it's singular or plural.</p>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>AND = Always Plural</strong></p>
            <p><strong>✅ Examples:</strong></p>

            <p>• The cat <strong>and</strong> the dog <strong>are</strong> friends.</p>
            <p>• Running <strong>and</strong> swimming <strong>are</strong> good exercise.</p>
            <p><em>Rule: Two or more things connected by "and" = always plural!</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>OR/NOR = Closest Subject Wins</strong></p>

            <p>→ Closest to verb: <span >students</span> (plural) → <strong>are</strong></p>

            <p>• Either the students <strong>or</strong> the teacher <strong>is</strong> wrong.</p>
            <p>→ Closest to verb: <span >teacher</span> (singular) → <strong>is</strong></p>

            <p>• Neither Sarah <strong>nor</strong> her friends <strong>are</strong> coming.</p>

        <p>→ Use your indefinite pronoun memory list</p>
        <p>→ Remember: compound subjects with "and" = plural</p>
        <p>→ Remember: compound subjects with "or/nor" = closest subject wins</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Match verb form to subject</p>
        <p>→ Singular subject = verb ends in 's' (in present tense)</p>
        <p>→ Plural subject = verb has no 's' ending</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Check verb tense consistency</p>
        <p>→ All verbs should generally be in same tense</p>
        <p>→ Use context clues for time relationships</p>

    <h3>Part 1: Who vs. Whom - The Ultimate Trick</h3>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>💡 Why This Topic Terrifies Students (But Shouldn't Terrify You!)</h4>
        <p><strong>The truth:</strong> Who vs. Whom looks scary, but it follows the <em>exact same pattern</em> as subject vs. object pronouns you already know!</p>
        <p><span >WHO</span> = subject (like <strong>he, she, they</strong>)</p>
        <p><span >WHOM</span> = object (like <strong>him, her, them</strong>)</p>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>🎯 The "He/Him" Test (Works Every Time!)</h4>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Find the who/whom in the sentence</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Replace it with "he" or "him"</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If "he" sounds right → use <span >WHO</span></p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> If "him" sounds right → use <span >WHOM</span></p>

        <h4>❌ The #1 Pronoun Trap: Compound Subjects and Objects</h4>
        <p><strong>The problem:</strong> When there are two people, students often choose the wrong pronoun.</p>

            <p><strong>Common Mistakes:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>❌ Wrong:</strong> Sarah and <strong>me</strong> went to the movies.</p>

    <h3>Part 3: Pronoun Agreement - Making Perfect Matches</h3>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>💡 The Golden Rule of Pronoun Agreement</h4>
        <p>Every pronoun must <strong>agree</strong> with its antecedent (the noun it replaces) in:</p>
        <p>• <strong>Number:</strong> singular pronouns for singular nouns, plural for plural</p>
        <p>• <strong>Gender:</strong> he/him for males, she/her for females, it for things</p>
        <p>• <strong>Person:</strong> consistent point of view (don't mix "you" and "one")</p>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Part 1: The Golden Rule (It Never Changes!)</h3>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>💡 The Universal Modifier Principle</h4>
        <p><strong>Modifiers must sit RIGHT NEXT TO the word or phrase they describe.</strong></p>
        <p><em>That's it! This simple rule prevents 90% of modifier errors on the ACT.</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>📋 What Are Modifiers? (The Describing Words and Phrases)</h4>
        <p>Modifiers are words or phrases that give extra information about other words in the sentence.</p>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Common Modifier Types:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Adjectives:</strong> The <span >red</span> car drove quickly.</p>
            <p><strong>Adverbs:</strong> She sang <span >beautifully</span>.</p>
            <p><strong>Phrases:</strong> <span >Running late for work</span>, Tom forgot his lunch.</p>
            <p><strong>Clauses:</strong> The book <span >that I borrowed</span> was excellent.</p>

        <h4>📋 The Proximity Rule in Action</h4>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>✅ Correct Placement:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Modifier first:</strong> <span >Walking down the street</span>, <span >I</span> noticed the trees looked beautiful.</p>
            <p><em>The modifier "Walking down the street" sits right next to "I" (who was walking).</em></p>

            <p><strong>Modifier last:</strong> <span >I</span> noticed the trees looked beautiful <span >while walking down the street</span>.</p>
            <p><em>The modifier is still close to "I" and clearly describes who was walking.</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>❌ Wrong Placement:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Confusing:</strong> <span >Walking down the street</span>, <span >the trees</span> looked beautiful.</p>
            <p><em>This literally says the trees were walking down the street! The modifier is next to "trees" instead of the person who was actually walking.</em></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="pro-tip">
        <h4>🎯 The "Who or What?" Test</h4>
        <p><strong>For every modifier, ask:</strong> "Who or what is actually doing this action or having this description?"</p>
        <p><strong>Then place the modifier right next to that word!</strong></p>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>💡 What Makes a Modifier "Dangle"</h4>
        <p>A dangling modifier occurs when the word or phrase it's supposed to modify <strong>isn't actually in the sentence</strong>. The modifier is "dangling" with nothing to attach to!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>📋 Classic Dangling Modifier Patterns</h4>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Pattern 1: Action Phrases with No Actor</strong></p>
            <p><strong>❌ Dangling:</strong> <span >Having finished homework</span>, the TV was turned on.</p>
            <p><em>Problem: Who finished homework? The TV didn't finish homework!</em></p>

            <p><strong>✅ Fixed:</strong> <span >Having finished homework</span>, <span >Sarah</span> turned on the TV.</p>
            <p><em>Now "Sarah" is right next to the modifier, so we know she finished the homework.</em></p>

            <p><strong>✅ Also fixed:</strong> <span >After Sarah finished homework</span>, she turned on the TV.</p>
            <p><em>Alternative: Make the modifier a complete clause with its own subject.</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Pattern 2: "-ing" Phrases Without Clear Subjects</strong></p>
            <p><strong>❌ Dangling:</strong> <span >Running to catch the bus</span>, my backpack fell off.</p>
            <p><em>Problem: The backpack wasn't running—I was running!</em></p>

            <p><strong>✅ Fixed:</strong> <span >Running to catch the bus</span>, <span >I</span> dropped my backpack.</p>
            <p><em>Now "I" is the subject doing the running.</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Pattern 3: "To" Phrases (Infinitives) with Missing Subjects</strong></p>
            <p><strong>❌ Dangling:</strong> <span >To get better grades</span>, more studying is necessary.</p>
            <p><em>Problem: Who wants better grades? "More studying" doesn't want grades!</em></p>

            <p><strong>✅ Fixed:</strong> <span >To get better grades</span>, <span >students</span> must study more.</p>
            <p><em>Now "students" are the ones who want better grades.</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Pattern 4: Past Participle Phrases (-ed phrases)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>❌ Dangling:</strong> <span >Born in 1990</span>, the new millennium was exciting for me.</p>
            <p><em>Problem: The millennium wasn't born in 1990—I was!</em></p>

            <p><strong>✅ Fixed:</strong> <span >Born in 1990</span>, <span >I</span> found the new millennium exciting.</p>
            <p><em>Now "I" is the one who was born in 1990.</em></p>

    </div>

    <div class="pro-tip">
        <h4>🎯 The Dangling Modifier Fix Formula</h4>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Identify what the modifier describes (who's doing the action?)</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Make sure that word appears right after the comma</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If it's not there, add it or rewrite the sentence</p>

    <h3>Part 3: Misplaced Modifiers - The Wrong Attachments</h3>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>💡 What Makes a Modifier "Misplaced"</h4>
        <p>A misplaced modifier occurs when the modifier <strong>is in the sentence</strong> but sits next to the wrong word, creating confusion or unintended humor.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>📋 Common Misplaced Modifier Patterns</h4>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Pattern 1: "Almost," "Only," "Just" in Wrong Positions</strong></p>
            <p><strong>❌ Confusing:</strong> She <span >almost</span> drove her kids to school every day.</p>
            <p><em>Problem: Did she "almost drive" (but didn't) or drive "almost every day"?</em></p>

            <p><strong>✅ Clear:</strong> She drove her kids to school <span >almost</span> every day.</p>
            <p><em>Now it's clear she drove them on most days, but not quite every day.</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Pattern 2: Descriptive Phrases in Wrong Locations</strong></p>
            <p><strong>❌ Confusing:</strong> The car belongs to a woman <span >with a dented fender</span>.</p>
            <p><em>Problem: Does the woman have a dented fender, or does the car?</em></p>

            <p><strong>✅ Clear:</strong> The car <span >with a dented fender</span> belongs to a woman.</p>
            <p><em>Now it's clear the car has the dented fender.</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Pattern 3: Relative Clauses (who, which, that) Far from Antecedents</strong></p>
            <p><strong>❌ Confusing:</strong> I saw a dog in the park <span >that was barking loudly</span>.</p>
            <p><em>Problem: Was the park barking loudly, or the dog?</em></p>

            <p><strong>✅ Clear:</strong> I saw a dog <span >that was barking loudly</span> in the park.</p>
            <p><em>Now it's clear the dog was barking loudly.</em></p>

            <p><strong>✅ Also clear:</strong> In the park, I saw a dog <span >that was barking loudly</span>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Pattern 4: Prepositional Phrases Creating Ambiguity</strong></p>
            <p><strong>❌ Confusing:</strong> The teacher spoke to the student <span >with concern</span>.</p>
            <p><em>Problem: Is the teacher concerned, or is the student concerned?</em></p>

            <p><strong>✅ Clear:</strong> <span >With concern</span>, the teacher spoke to the student.</p>
            <p><em>Now it's clear the teacher was concerned.</em></p>

            <p><strong>✅ Also clear:</strong> The teacher spoke to the student who seemed concerned.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="pro-tip">
        <h4>🎯 The Misplaced Modifier Fix Strategy</h4>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Find the modifier and ask "What exactly is it describing?"</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Move the modifier so it sits next to that word</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Read the sentence again to make sure it's clear</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> If moving doesn't work, rewrite for clarity</p>

    <h3>Special Cases: Tricky Modifier Situations on the ACT</h3>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>📋 Absolute Constructions (Advanced)</h4>
        <p>Some modifying phrases are "absolute"—they modify the entire sentence rather than one specific word.</p>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Acceptable Absolute Constructions:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>✅ Correct:</strong> <span >Weather permitting</span>, we'll have the picnic tomorrow.</p>
            <p><strong>✅ Correct:</strong> <span >Generally speaking</span>, students enjoy summer break.</p>
            <p><strong>✅ Correct:</strong> <span >All things considered</span>, the project was a success.</p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>📋 Squinting Modifiers (The Two-Way Confusers)</h4>
        <p>Sometimes a modifier sits between two words and could logically modify either one.</p>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Squinting Modifier Problems:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>❌ Ambiguous:</strong> Students who study <span >frequently</span> get better grades.</p>
            <p><em>Problem: Do students "study frequently" or "frequently get better grades"?</em></p>

            <p><strong>✅ Clear Option 1:</strong> Students who <span >frequently</span> study get better grades.</p>

    <h3>Chapter 6 Master Strategy: Your ACT Modifier Decision Process</h3>
    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>🎯 When You See Modifier Questions on the ACT:</h4>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Find the modifier</strong></p>
        <p>→ Look for descriptive phrases, especially at the beginning of sentences</p>
        <p>→ Common starters: -ing phrases, -ed phrases, "to" phrases, prepositional phrases</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Ask "What does it describe?"</strong></p>
        <p>→ Who is doing the action in the modifier?</p>
        <p>→ What is being described by the modifier?</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Check placement</strong></p>
        <p>→ Is the modifier right next to what it describes?</p>
        <p>→ If not, it's either dangling or misplaced</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Apply the fix</strong></p>
        <p>→ For dangling: Add the missing word or rewrite</p>
        <p>→ For misplaced: Move the modifier to the correct position</p>
        <p>→ For squinting: Clarify which word is being modified</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Do the logic test</strong></p>
        <p>→ Read the corrected sentence</p>
        <p>→ Does it make logical sense?</p>
        <p>→ Is there any remaining ambiguity?</p>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>📋 Complex Parallel Lists (Multiple Word Phrases)</h4>
        <p>Sometimes list items are longer phrases, but they still need parallel structure.</p>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Parallel Phrase Examples:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>✅ Correct:</strong> The job requires <span >analyzing data</span>, <span >writing reports</span>, and <span >presenting findings</span>.</p>
            <p><em>All are gerund phrases (action + object).</em></p>

            <p><strong>✅ Correct:</strong> To succeed, you must <span >study hard</span>, <span >attend class</span>, and <span >ask questions</span>.</p>
            <p><em>All are verb + adverb/object phrases.</em></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="concept-box">

    <h3>Chapter 7 Master Strategy: Your ACT Parallelism Decision Process</h3>
    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>🎯 When You See Parallel Structure Questions on the ACT:</h4>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Find the list or comparison</strong></p>
        <p>→ Look for commas with "and" (lists) or comparison words (better than, rather than, etc.)</p>
        <p>→ Look for correlative conjunctions (either...or, not only...but also)</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Identify what each item should be</strong></p>
        <p>→ What comes after the main verb? (gerunds, infinitives, simple verbs?)</p>
        <p>→ What fits grammatically with the beginning of the sentence?</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Check if all items match</strong></p>
        <p>→ Use the "plug-in test" for lists</p>
        <p>→ Use the "cover up test" for comparisons</p>
        <p>→ All items must be the same grammatical type</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Fix any mismatches</strong></p>
        <p>→ Change the odd item to match the others</p>
        <p>→ Or change all items to a consistent form</p>
        <p>→ Choose the option that sounds most natural</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Double-check with the sound test</strong></p>
        <p>→ Read the corrected sentence aloud</p>
        <p>→ Does it have a smooth rhythm?</p>
        <p>→ Does it sound professional and clear?</p>

        <h4>📋 How to Convert Passive to Active</h4>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>The 3-Step Conversion Process:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Find who's doing the action (often after "by")</p>
            <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Make that person/thing the subject</p>
            <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Change the verb to active form</p>

            <p><strong>Example conversion:</strong></p>
            <p><span >❌ Passive:</span> "Mistakes were made by the committee during the planning process."</p>
            <p><span >✅ Active:</span> "The committee made mistakes during the planning process."</p>

        <p>Sometimes passive voice is actually the better choice:</p>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Acceptable Passive Situations:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>1. Unknown actor:</strong> "The window was broken during the storm."</p>
            <p><em>We don't know who/what broke it, so passive works.</em></p>

            <p><strong>2. Unimportant actor:</strong> "The vaccines were developed in 2020."</p>
            <p><em>We care about the vaccines, not specifically who developed them.</em></p>

            <p><strong>3. Scientific/formal writing:</strong> "The samples were analyzed using advanced techniques."</p>

        <h4>🎯 The "By Zombie" Test</h4>
        <p><strong>If you can add "by zombies" after the verb and it makes sense, it's passive!</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> "The car was driven (by zombies)" ← Passive!</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> "Sarah drove the car (by zombies)" ← Doesn't work, so it's active!</p>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>📋 Common Precision Traps</h4>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Register: Formal vs. Informal</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Academic writing needs formal word choice:</strong></p>
            <p>• <strong>Less formal:</strong> "The experiment was pretty cool."</p>
            <p>• <strong>More formal:</strong> "The experiment yielded fascinating results."</p>

            <p>• <strong>Less formal:</strong> "Kids learn better with hands-on stuff."</p>
            <p>• <strong>More formal:</strong> "Students learn more effectively through experiential activities."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Connotation: Positive, Negative, Neutral</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Same meaning, different feelings:</strong></p>
            <p>• <strong>Positive:</strong> determined, persistent, dedicated</p>
            <p>• <strong>Negative:</strong> stubborn, obsessive, fanatical</p>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>🎯 When You See Word Choice & Usage Questions on the ACT:</h4>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Identify the question type</strong></p>
        <p>→ Confused words? Look for homophones or near-homophones</p>
        <p>→ Voice? Look for passive constructions (was/were + past participle)</p>
        <p>→ Idioms? Look for verb/adjective + preposition combinations</p>
        <p>→ Precision? Consider formality, connotation, and specificity</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Apply the appropriate test</strong></p>
        <p>→ For confused words: Use the substitution test</p>
        <p>→ For voice: Use the "by zombies" test, prefer active</p>
        <p>→ For idioms: Trust your ear or use memorized combinations</p>
        <p>→ For precision: Choose the most appropriate tone and specificity</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Double-check your choice</strong></p>
        <p>→ Does it make logical sense in context?</p>
        <p>→ Does it match the formality level of the passage?</p>
        <p>→ Does it create the right emphasis and clarity?</p>

      <p class="lesson-intro">Before we start this book, let's begin by understanding the basic format of the ACT Math Test and general strategies you will need for success.</p>

      <h3>Format of the Test</h3>
      <p>The ACT Math Test consists of one section: a 50-minute section with 45 questions. A calculator is allowed in this section, and you should use your calculator a lot! Even for simple mental math, use the calculator. This will help keep your mind fresh and avoid simple mistakes.</p>

      <h3>Difficulty of the Questions</h3>
      <p>As you progress through the test, the difficulty of the questions increases. The first 5-10 questions in general will be much easier. As you move towards the later questions, the difficulty will increase slightly until around question 30, where the questions will quickly get much more difficult.</p>

      <div class="rules-box">
        <h4>Question Difficulty Breakdown:</h4>
        <table>
          <tr><th>Difficulty</th><th>Question Number</th></tr>
          <tr><td>Very Easy</td><td>1 – 5</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Easy</td><td>6 – 15</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Medium</td><td>16– 30</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Hard</td><td>31 – 45</td></tr>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h3>Time Management</h3>
      <p>On average, you have just over 1 minute (1 minute and 6 seconds to be exact) to answer each question. Some questions can be solved very quickly while others can take much longer to solve. In general, you should be solving the earlier questions in less than 60 seconds, as the later, more difficult questions will require more time.</p>

      <p>If you get to a question that you do not know how to solve, circle the number, bubble in an answer, and move on. You can always come back to the questions that you circled at the end if you have time left.</p>

      <h3>Guessing</h3>
      <p>There is no penalty for guessing. Make sure that you bubble in an answer for every single question. On a multiple-choice test, there is no best method for guessing, so look at the answer choices and pick the answer that looks best to you.</p>

  'backsolving': {
    title: 'Chapter 1: Backsolving',
    duration: 25, // minutes (includes practice test)
    content: `
      <p class="lesson-intro">In the first two chapters, you will learn two important test-taking techniques: backsolving and substitution. As you work through the rest of the book, use these techniques whenever you can to solve questions.</p>

      <p>Backsolving is plugging the answer choices back into the question. On the ACT, you are given 4 answer choices for multiple choice questions, and one of those 4 choices must be correct. Rather than solving the question algebraically and determining whether your answer matches one of the answer choices, you can guess-and-check with the answer choices to find which one is correct.</p>

      <h3>Backsolving can be done using five steps:</h3>
      <div class="rules-box">
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Start with B or C.</strong> Plug the value in the answer choice back into the question. The answer choices are always in order of smallest to largest or largest to smallest so starting in the middle saves you time.</li>
          <li><strong>Solve the question using this value.</strong> Find any other unknowns if necessary.</li>
          <li><strong>If this answer choice works correctly, you're done!</strong> Bubble it in and move on.</li>
          <li><strong>If this answer choice does not work, cross it off.</strong> If you know the correct answer needs to be smaller or larger than the value you just tried, cross off any other incorrect answers.</li>
          <li><strong>Pick one of the remaining answer choices and plug it back into the question.</strong> Repeat this until you find the correct answer. Remember, one of the 4 answer choices must work!</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="example-box">
        <h4>Example 1:</h4>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> If √x + 10 − 2√x − 2 = 0, what is the value of x?</p>
        <p>A. 2 &nbsp;&nbsp; B. 6 &nbsp;&nbsp; C. 14 &nbsp;&nbsp; D. 18</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> The quickest and easiest way to solve this question is backsolving. Finding the correct answer is just a process of guess-and-check. Below, you can see how the correct answer B, when x = 6, makes the equation be true.</p>
        <p>√6 + 10 − 2√6 − 2 = 0<br>
        √16 − 2√4 = 0<br>
        4 − 2(2) = 0<br>
        4 − 4 = 0<br>
        0 = 0</p>
        <p>The answer is B. If we plug in any of the other answer choices, we will get an equation that is not equal on both sides and is incorrect.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="example-box">
        <h4>Example 2:</h4>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Which of the following is a solution to the equation of x³ + 5x² + 6x = 0?</p>
        <p>A) −3 &nbsp;&nbsp; B) −1 &nbsp;&nbsp; C) 1 &nbsp;&nbsp; D) 2</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Most students look at this question and think, "Oh no, I need to factor this to solve." However, the easiest way to solve this question is backsolving! We plug the answer choices into the equation to see which one makes it equal 0.</p>
        <p>When x = −3: (−3)³ + 5(−3)² + 6(−3) = 0<br>
        −27 + 45 − 18 = 0<br>
        0 = 0</p>
        <p>The answer is A. If we plug in any other answer choices, the equation will not equal 0.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Backsolving With Points</h3>
      <p>For questions with points in the question or answer choices, it is often effective to backsolve with points. For this method, we will use the point(s) to test which equation works correctly. Remember, if a point is on a graph, it must make the equation of the graph true.</p>

      <div class="key-takeaway">
        <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
        <p>Backsolving is often the fastest and easiest way to solve ACT questions, especially if you get stuck and cannot solve a question algebraically, so use it to your advantage.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Practice Problems</h3>
      <p>Now that you've learned the backsolving technique, try applying it to these additional practice problems. Remember to start with answer choice B or C!</p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <h4>Practice Problem 1:</h4>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> If 2x² - 8x + 6 = 0, what is one possible value of x?</p>
        <p>A. 1 &nbsp;&nbsp; B. 2 &nbsp;&nbsp; C. 3 &nbsp;&nbsp; D. 4</p>
        <div class="practice-hint">
          <p><strong>Hint:</strong> Start with B or C and plug the value back into the equation to see if it equals 0.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="example-box">
        <h4>Practice Problem 2:</h4>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Which point lies on the line 3x - 2y = 12?</p>
        <p>A. (2, -3) &nbsp;&nbsp; B. (4, 0) &nbsp;&nbsp; C. (0, 6) &nbsp;&nbsp; D. (6, 3)</p>
        <div class="practice-hint">
          <p><strong>Hint:</strong> Substitute each point's x and y values into the equation to see which one makes the equation true.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="summary-box">
        <h4>🎯 Backsolving Summary</h4>
        <p><strong>When to use backsolving:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>When the question asks for a specific value and gives multiple choice answers</li>
          <li>When algebraic solving seems complex or time-consuming</li>
          <li>When you're unsure how to start solving algebraically</li>
          <li>For equations, inequalities, and point-on-line problems</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Always start with B or C to save time, and systematically eliminate wrong answers!</p>

            <p class="lesson-intro">Pronoun questions appear 6-10 times per ACT English test, testing reference clarity, agreement, and proper case usage. Mastering pronouns eliminates ambiguity and demonstrates sophisticated writing skills.</p>

            <h3>The ACT's Pronoun Testing Framework</h3>
            <p>The ACT evaluates pronouns through three critical areas: clear antecedent reference, proper agreement, and correct case usage. Understanding these principles ensures pronoun precision throughout your writing.</p>

      <h3>Areas, Volumes, and Units</h3>
      <p>The ACT loves to ask area or volume questions with various units. The most common are yards and feet or feet and inches. Students often answer these questions incorrectly because they make mistakes with unit conversion, even though the math is very simple.</p>

      <div class="rules-box">
        <h4>Unit Conversions to Memorize:</h4>
        <p><strong>Yards and Feet</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1 yard = 3 feet</strong></li>
          <li><strong>1 square yard = 9 square feet</strong></li>
          <li><strong>1 cubic yard = 27 cubic feet</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Feet and Inches</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1 foot = 12 inches</strong></li>
          <li><strong>1 square foot = 144 square inches</strong></li>
          <li><strong>1 cubic foot = 1,728 cubic inches</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Key Strategy:</strong> Always convert units BEFORE solving for any area or volume.</p>

      <h3>Volumes of Other Three-Dimensional Solids</h3>
      <p>The volume of any three-dimensional shape can be calculating using the equation <strong>V = B × h</strong> where B is the area of the base and h is the height.</p>

      <h3>Right Triangles</h3>
      <div class="rules-box">
        <h4>Pythagorean Theorem:</h4>
        <p><strong>a² + b² = c²</strong></p>
        <p>where a and b are the lengths of the legs and c is the hypotenuse. You can only use the Pythagorean Theorem equation for right triangles.</p>

        <h4>Pythagorean Triples:</h4>
        <p>Pythagorean triples are sets of whole numbers that work in the Pythagorean theorem. On the ACT, you should look out for the two common Pythagorean triples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>3, 4, 5 Right Triangle</strong></li>
          <li><strong>5, 12, 13 Right Triangle</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>These triangles can also be scaled up by multiplying all of the side lengths by the same number to create more Pythagorean triples. For example, a 3, 4, 5 right triangle can be doubled to become a 6, 8, 10 right triangle, tripled to become 9, 12, 15, and so on.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Special Right Triangles</h3>
      <p>You will need to be familiar with two special right triangles: 45° − 45° − 90° and 30° − 60° − 90°. The side lengths of these triangles are always in a particular ratio.</p>

          <h4>Strategic Transition Selection</h4>
          <p>Analyze the sentences before and after the transition to identify the logical relationship. The transition must accurately reflect how the ideas connect.</p>

    <h3>Part 1: <span style="color: #3b82f6; font-weight: 600;">Slope</span> - The Steepness of a Line</h3>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>💡 Core Definition</h4>
        <p><strong>Slope = Rise over Run = Change in y over Change in x</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Formula: m = (y₂ - y₁) / (x₂ - x₁)</strong></p>
        <p>Slope tells us how much y changes for every 1 unit that x changes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="rules-box">
        <h4>Essential Slope Rules:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Positive slope:</strong> Line goes UP from left to right ↗</li>
            <li><strong>Negative slope:</strong> Line goes DOWN from left to right ↘</li>
            <li><strong>Zero slope:</strong> Horizontal line (flat) →</li>

        <h4>Example 1: Finding Slope</h4>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Find the slope of the line passing through points (2, 5) and (6, 13).</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <p>m = (y₂ - y₁) / (x₂ - x₁)</p>
        <p>m = (13 - 5) / (6 - 2)</p>
        <p>m = 8 / 4 = 2</p>
        <p><strong>The slope is 2, meaning the line goes up 2 units for every 1 unit right.</strong></p>

    <div class="rules-box">
        <h4>Three Important Forms:</h4>

        <p><strong>1. Slope-Intercept Form: y = mx + b</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>m = slope</li>
            <li>b = y-intercept (where line crosses y-axis)</li>
            <li><em>Most useful for graphing and identifying slope/y-intercept</em></li>

        <p><strong>3. Standard Form: Ax + By = C</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A, B, C are integers (A should be positive)</li>
            <li><em>Used when both x and y intercepts are important</em></li>

    <div class="example-box">
        <h4>Example 3: Writing Line Equations</h4>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Write the equation of the line with slope -2 that passes through (3, 7).</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Method 1 - Point-Slope Form:</strong></p>
        <p>y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)</p>
        <p>y - 7 = -2(x - 3)</p>
        <p>y - 7 = -2x + 6</p>
        <p>y = -2x + 13</p>

        <p><strong>Method 2 - Slope-Intercept Form directly:</strong></p>
        <p>y = mx + b, substitute the point (3, 7) and slope -2</p>
        <p>7 = -2(3) + b</p>
        <p>7 = -6 + b</p>

        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <p>Distance = √[(x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²]</p>
        <p>Distance = √[(5 - (-1))² + (-5 - 3)²]</p>
        <p>Distance = √[(6)² + (-8)²]</p>

        <p>Step 1: After lunch, remaining pizza = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4</p>
        <p>Step 2: For dinner, she ate 2/3 of this remaining amount</p>
        <p>Step 3: Dinner portion = 2/3 × 3/4 = 6/12 = 1/2</p>
        <p><strong>Answer: She ate 1/2 of the original pizza for dinner.</strong></p>

        <p>Final Price = $100 × (1 + 0.20) × (1 - 0.15)</p>
        <p>Final Price = $100 × 1.20 × 0.85</p>
        <p>Final Price = $100 × 1.02 = $102</p>

        <p><strong>Verification:</strong></p>
        <p>After 20% increase: $100 × 1.20 = $120</p>
        <p>After 15% decrease: $120 × 0.85 = $102 ✓</p>

<div class="key-takeaway">
    <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
    <p>Percentages appear on every ACT! Master the basic formula (Part/Whole × 100), understand percent change calculations, never add successive percentages, and practice word problems. Use the multiplier method for efficiency: increase by 25% means multiply by 1.25, decrease by 15% means multiply by 0.85!</p>

        <h4>💡 What is a Function?</h4>
        <p><strong>A function is a rule that assigns exactly one output to each input</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Function notation:</strong> f(x) = 2x + 3</p>
        <p><em>"f of x equals 2x plus 3" - f is the function name, x is the input, 2x+3 is the rule</em></p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Identify the function rule</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Substitute the given input value</strong> for every x</li>
            <li><strong>Simplify using order of operations</strong></li>

        <h4>Factoring Techniques (In Order of Difficulty):</h4>

        <p><strong>1. Greatest Common Factor (GCF) - Always Check First!</strong></p>
        <p>Factor out the largest common factor from all terms.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Difference of Squares: a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)</strong></p>
        <p>Works when you have two perfect squares being subtracted.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Perfect Square Trinomials:</strong></p>
        <p>• a² + 2ab + b² = (a + b)²</p>
        <p>• a² - 2ab + b² = (a - b)²</p>

        <p><strong>4. General Trinomials: ax² + bx + c</strong></p>
        <p>When a = 1: Look for two numbers that multiply to c and add to b</p>
        <p>When a ≠ 1: Use AC method or trial-and-error</p>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>💡 What is a System of Equations?</h4>
        <p>A system is <strong>multiple equations with the same variables</strong> that must be true simultaneously.</p>
        <p>Example: {x + y = 5, 2x - y = 4} → Find values of x and y that work in BOTH equations</p>
    </div>

    <div class="rules-box">
        <h4>Substitution Method Steps:</h4>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Solve one equation for one variable</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Substitute that expression into the other equation</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Solve the resulting single-variable equation</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Back-substitute to find the other variable</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Check your solution in BOTH original equations</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <h4>Example 1: Basic Substitution</h4>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Solve {x + y = 7, 2x - y = 8}</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <p>Step 1: From first equation: y = 7 - x</p>
        <p>Step 2: Substitute into second equation: 2x - (7 - x) = 8</p>
        <p>Step 3: Solve: 2x - 7 + x = 8 → 3x = 15 → x = 5</p>
        <p>Step 4: Back-substitute: y = 7 - 5 = 2</p>
        <p>Step 5: Check: 5 + 2 = 7 ✓, 2(5) - 2 = 8 ✓</p>
        <p><strong>Solution: (5, 2)</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <h4>Example 2: Substitution with Fractions</h4>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Solve {y = 3x - 1, x + 2y = 11}</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <p>Step 1: First equation already solved: y = 3x - 1</p>
        <p>Step 2: Substitute: x + 2(3x - 1) = 11</p>
        <p>Step 3: Solve: x + 6x - 2 = 11 → 7x = 13 → x = 13/7</p>
        <p>Step 4: Back-substitute: y = 3(13/7) - 1 = 39/7 - 7/7 = 32/7</p>

        <h4>Elimination Method Steps:</h4>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Line up equations with variables aligned</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Multiply one or both equations to make coefficients of one variable opposites</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add equations to eliminate that variable</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Solve the resulting single-variable equation</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Substitute back to find the other variable</p>

    <div class="example-box">
        <h4>Example 3: Direct Elimination</h4>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Solve {3x + y = 11, 2x - y = 4}</p>

        <p>3x + y = 11</p>
        <p>2x - y = 4</p>
        <p>Step 2: Coefficients of y are already opposites (+1 and -1)</p>

        <p>5x = 15 → x = 3</p>
        <p>Step 4: Substitute back: 3(3) + y = 11 → y = 2</p>

        <p>Step 1: To eliminate x, make coefficients opposites</p>
        <p>Multiply first equation by 5: 10x + 15y = 80</p>
        <p>Multiply second equation by -2: -10x + 4y = -8</p>
        <p>Step 2: Add equations: 19y = 72 → y = 72/19</p>
        <p>Step 3: Substitute back: 2x + 3(72/19) = 16</p>
        <p>2x = 16 - 216/19 = (304 - 216)/19 = 88/19</p>

    <h3>🔗 ACT Systems Strategies</h3>

    <div class="tip-box">
        <h4>💡 Method Selection</h4>
        <p><strong>Use Substitution when:</strong></p>
        <p>• One variable is already isolated</p>
        <p>• Easy to solve for one variable</p>
        <p>• Coefficients are 1 or simple fractions</p>

        <p><strong>Use Elimination when:</strong></p>
        <p>• Coefficients are already opposites or easily made opposites</p>
        <p>• Both equations have similar complexity</p>
        <p>• Working with integers</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <h4>Example 12: ACT-Style Choice</h4>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Solve {3x - 2y = 7, x + 4y = 1} Choose the best method.</p>
        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
        <p>Substitution looks good: x = 1 - 4y from second equation</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <p>Substitute: 3(1 - 4y) - 2y = 7</p>
        <p>3 - 12y - 2y = 7 → -14y = 4 → y = -2/7</p>
        <p>x = 1 - 4(-2/7) = 1 + 8/7 = 15/7</p>
        <p><strong>Solution: (15/7, -2/7)</strong></p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="key-takeaway">
    <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
    <p>Systems of equations are crucial for ACT word problems! Master both substitution and elimination methods, choose the easier method for each problem, and always check your solutions. Remember: substitution works great when one variable is isolated, elimination works well with similar coefficients. Practice identifying the three types of solutions: one solution (intersecting lines), no solution (parallel lines), and infinite solutions (same line)!</p>

    <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
    <p>Sequences and series are about recognizing patterns! Master the difference between arithmetic (constant difference) and geometric (constant ratio) sequences, memorize the key formulas, and practice identifying sequence types quickly. Remember: always check if differences are constant first, then ratios, then look for special patterns like squares or cubes. For infinite geometric series, convergence only occurs when |r| < 1. These concepts appear frequently in ACT word problems and pattern recognition questions!</p>

    <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>💡 Logarithm Definition</h4>
        <p>A logarithm answers the question: <strong>"To what power must we raise the base to get this number?"</strong></p>

        <p>Example: log₂(8) = 3 because 2³ = 8</p>
    </div>

    <div class="rules-box">
        <h4>Common Logarithm Types:</h4>

        <p><strong>Common Log (base 10):</strong> log(x) = log₁₀(x)</p>
        <p><strong>Natural Log (base e):</strong> ln(x) = log_e(x)</p>
        <p><strong>Binary Log (base 2):</strong> log₂(x)</p>

        <p><strong>Key Relationships:</strong></p>
        <p>• log_b(b) = 1 (any base to the first power equals itself)</p>
        <p>• log_b(1) = 0 (any base to the zero power equals 1)</p>
        <p>• log_b(b^x) = x (logarithm and exponential cancel out)</p>
        <p>• b^(log_b(x)) = x (exponential and logarithm cancel out)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <h4>Example 1: Converting Between Forms</h4>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Convert between exponential and logarithmic form:</p>
        <p>a) 3⁴ = 81</p>
        <p>b) log₅(125) = 3</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <p>a) 3⁴ = 81 → log₃(81) = 4</p>
        <p>b) log₅(125) = 3 → 5³ = 125</p>
        <p><strong>a) log₃(81) = 4, b) 5³ = 125</strong></p>

        <p>b) log₁₀(1000)</p>
        <p>c) ln(e³)</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <p>a) log₂(16): What power of 2 gives 16? 2⁴ = 16, so log₂(16) = 4</p>
        <p>b) log₁₀(1000): What power of 10 gives 1000? 10³ = 1000, so log₁₀(1000) = 3</p>

    <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
    <p>Logarithms are the inverse of exponentials! Master the basic definition (log_b(x) = y means b^y = x), memorize the three key properties (product, quotient, and power rules), and practice converting between logarithmic and exponential forms. Remember: logarithms turn multiplication into addition, division into subtraction, and powers into multiplication. These concepts appear in advanced ACT problems involving exponential growth, pH calculations, and earthquake measurements!</p>

    <p>Conic sections combine algebra and geometry in powerful ways! Master the standard forms of circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas, and practice converting between general and standard forms. Remember: circles have equal coefficients for x² and y², ellipses have different positive coefficients, parabolas have only one squared term, and hyperbolas have opposite signs. These advanced topics test your ability to work with complex algebraic expressions and geometric relationships!</p>

    <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
    <p>Complex numbers extend the real number system to include square roots of negative numbers! Master the powers of i (repeating pattern: i, -1, -i, 1), practice operations with complex numbers, and understand conjugates for division. Remember: i² = -1 always, complex conjugates multiply to give real numbers, and the absolute value uses the Pythagorean theorem. Complex numbers appear in advanced ACT problems and connect algebra with geometry through the complex plane!</p>

              <h4>Comma Mastery Rules:</h4>
              <ul>
                  <li>Independent clause + comma + FANBOYS + independent clause</li>
                  <li>Dependent clause + comma + independent clause (when dependent comes first)</li>
                  <li>Commas around non-essential descriptive information</li>
                  <li>Commas separating items in series of three or more</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Subject-Verb Agreement Patterns:</h4>
              <ul>
                  <li>Eliminate prepositional phrases to identify true subject</li>
                  <li>Everyone, someone, anyone, each, every = singular verb</li>
                  <li>Neither/either constructions = singular verb</li>
                  <li>Compound subjects joined by 'and' = plural verb</li>

              <h4>Apostrophe Application Rules:</h4>
              <ul>
                  <li>Singular possession: noun + 's (student's book)</li>
                  <li>Plural possession: plural noun + ' (students' books)</li>
                  <li>Contractions: replace missing letters (don't, can't, it's)</li>
                  <li>Never use apostrophes: its, yours, theirs, hers, ours</li>
