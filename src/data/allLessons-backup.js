      <h3>Welcome to ACT Prep!</h3>
      <p>The ACT is a standardized test that measures your knowledge and skills in English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science. Understanding the test format and developing effective strategies are crucial for success.</p>

      <h3>Test Structure</h3>
      <p>The ACT consists of four main sections:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>English (45 minutes, 75 questions):</strong> Tests grammar, usage, punctuation, and rhetorical skills</li>
          <li><strong>Mathematics (60 minutes, 60 questions):</strong> Covers algebra, geometry, and trigonometry</li>
          <li><strong>Reading (35 minutes, 40 questions):</strong> Tests reading comprehension across various subjects</li>
          <li><strong>Science (35 minutes, 40 questions):</strong> Evaluates interpretation and analysis of scientific data</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Scoring</h3>
      <p>Each section is scored from 1-36, and your composite score is the average of all four sections. Most colleges consider a score of 20+ competitive, while top universities typically look for scores of 30+.</p>

      <h3>Study Strategy</h3>
      <p>Effective ACT preparation involves:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Taking a diagnostic test to identify strengths and weaknesses</li>
          <li>Focusing study time on areas that need the most improvement</li>
          <li>Learning test-specific strategies and time management techniques</li>
          <li>Taking multiple practice tests to build stamina and familiarity</li>
          <li>Reviewing mistakes and understanding why correct answers are right</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Remember: consistent, focused practice is more effective than cramming. Start with your weakest areas and gradually build confidence across all sections.</p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Why the ACT Tests Sentence Structure</h3>
            <p>Every ACT English test includes 10-15 sentence structure questions. The test writers want to know if you can identify complete vs. incomplete ideas and connect them properly.</p>

            <h3>The Foundation: Understanding Sentence Parts</h3>
            <p>Before tackling ACT questions, you need to recognize the two main types of sentence parts. Each part needs a subject (who/what) and a verb (action/being):</p>

            <div class="concept-box independent-clause">
                <div class="concept-header">
                    <h4>üü¢ Independent Clauses: ACT's Favorite Complete Ideas</h4>
                    <div class="visual-check">‚úì Stands alone ‚úì Could be its own sentence</div>
                </div>

                <p>On the ACT, independent clauses are complete ideas that could work as sentences by themselves. They have both a subject and a verb, and they express a finished thought.</p>

                <p>The ACT loves testing dependent clauses because they look like complete sentences but aren't. They start with connecting words that create incomplete ideas needing more information.</p>

                <h4>Phrases (The Incomplete Parts)</h4>
                <p>A <strong>phrase</strong> is missing either the "who" or the "action" (or both). It's like a half-finished idea that adds details but can't work by itself. These are helper pieces, not complete sentences.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples of incomplete thoughts:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chasing its tail... (who is chasing?)</li>
                    <li>Making some homemade peach scones for breakfast... (who is making them?)</li>
                    <li>Picking it up... (who picked what up?)</li>
                    <li>Excited to open up his present... (who is excited?)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>Simple Test: Does It Feel Complete?</h4>
                <p>Here's an easy way to tell them apart: Read each part silently. If it feels natural to stop reading, you have an independent clause. If you feel like you need to keep reading, it's either dependent or just a phrase.</p>
                <p>For dependent vs. phrase: Cover up the first word and read what's left. If it becomes a complete thought, you had a dependent clause. If it's still incomplete, it was just a phrase.</p>
                <p><strong>Try it yourself:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Complete thought:</strong> My brother Adam eats cookies every day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Needs more info:</strong> When my brother Adam eats cookies every day...</li>
                    <li><strong>Missing pieces:</strong> Eating cookies every day...</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Fixing Incomplete Sentences</h3>
            <p>Sometimes sentences don't work because they're missing key parts. <strong>Sentence fragments</strong> are like broken machines - they lack the pieces needed to function.</p>
            <p>Your brain often catches these because they sound off. Trust what sounds right!</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Broken:</strong> The student running to get to class on time. <em>(What did the student DO?)</em></p>
                <p><strong>Fixed:</strong> The student running to get to class on time dropped her water bottle.</p>
                <p><strong>Broken:</strong> Excited to go to the beach and surf. <em>(WHO is excited?)</em></p>
                <p><strong>Fixed:</strong> My little brother Shaun is excited to go to the beach and surf.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>The ACT's 5 Sentence Connection Rules</h3>
            <p>Here's what you need to know: the ACT tests sentence connections in predictable ways. Master these 5 rules and you'll handle every sentence structure question confidently.</p>

                        <span class="clause-label">Incomplete idea ‚Üí Complete idea</span></li>

                    <li><strong>Complete idea flows into incomplete (no comma).</strong><br>
                        <em>Sarah loves hiking while her brother prefers video games.</em><br>
                        <span class="clause-label">Complete idea ‚Üí Incomplete idea</span></li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <p><strong>These 5 rules are essential!</strong> The ACT will offer answers that sound fine but break these rules. Don't be fooled!</p>

            <h3>The Common Comma Splice Error</h3>
            <p>Here's the top mistake students make: believing a comma can do everything. <strong>A comma alone CANNOT connect two complete ideas.</strong> It's like trying to hold a heavy door with just tape - it fails!</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Broken:</strong> My phone died during the movie, I missed all the important texts.</p>
                <p><strong>Broken:</strong> The pizza arrived late, we ate it anyway because we were starving.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Both examples contain comma splices. Here's how to fix the first one using all 5 rules:</p>

            <div class="correction-box">
                <p><strong>Rule #1:</strong> My phone died during the movie. I missed all the important texts.</p>
                <p><strong>Rule #2:</strong> My phone died during the movie, so I missed all the important texts.</p>
                <p><strong>Rule #3:</strong> My phone died during the movie; I missed all the important texts.</p>
                <p><strong>Rule #4:</strong> When my phone died during the movie, I missed all the important texts.</p>
                <p><strong>Rule #5:</strong> My phone died during the movie because I missed all the important texts.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>Finding These Questions on Test Day</h4>
                <p>Watch for these clear signs of sentence structure questions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Mixed punctuation in answer choices.</strong> Seeing periods, commas, semicolons, or FANBOYS words? You're working with sentence structure!</li>
                    <li><strong>Different verb forms.</strong> Some answers show various verb forms (like "swimming" vs. "swims" vs. "swam"). This typically tests sentence completeness.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h3>Your Three-Step Strategy</h3>
            <p>When you find a sentence structure question, use this clear process:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Find the joining point</strong> - Where are they trying to connect ideas?</li>
                <li><strong>Check both sides</strong> - Is each side a complete idea or incomplete?</li>
                <li><strong>Choose the correct rule</strong> - Match it to one of your 5 connection methods.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="practice-box">
                <h4>Practice Time!</h4>
                <p><em>The concert tickets sold out in minutes, thousands of fans were disappointed.</em></p>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> Which version fixes this sentence best?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A. NO CHANGE</li>
                    <li>B. minutes, and thousands</li>
                    <li>C. minutes; leaving thousands</li>
                    <li>D. minutes. Thousands</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> B ‚Äì We need comma + FANBOYS to connect two complete ideas. Option A is a comma splice, C changes meaning, and D works but B flows better.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="key-takeaway">
                <h4>Key Point</h4>
                <p>Master these 5 connection rules and you'll excel at sentence structure questions! The key is identifying complete vs. incomplete ideas. When you see punctuation in answers, think "connection rules" and you'll succeed.</p>

      <p class="lesson-intro">Commas are the most common type of punctuation on the English Test. In order to successfully handle comma questions, we need to become familiar with the 4 types of commas that appear on the ACT.</p>

      <h3>The Four Types of Commas on the ACT</h3>
      <p>So far, we have already discussed the first two types of commas from Chapter 1:</p>

      <div class="concept-box">
          <h4>1. Comma + FANBOYS</h4>
          <p><strong>Correct:</strong> My alarm clock did not go off this morning, so I arrived late at school.</p>
          <p>Use a comma and a FANBOYS (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) to join two independent clauses.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="concept-box">
          <h4>2. Dependent clause followed by independent clause</h4>
          <p><strong>Correct:</strong> While electronic music has become very popular, many people still prefer classic rock.</p>
          <p>If a sentence has a dependent clause followed by an independent clause, you must link these with a comma.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Next, we will learn the other 2 types of commas in English and on the ACT:</p>

      <div class="concept-box">
          <h4>3. Unnecessary Information</h4>
          <p>Commas are used to separate unnecessary information from the rest of the sentence. Information is unnecessary if we can remove it without fundamentally changing the meaning of the sentence. Unnecessary information can be as short as a single word or as long as a lengthy phrase.</p>
          <p><strong>Example:</strong> Mrs. Ellison, who is known for giving pop quizzes, is my least favorite teacher.</p>
          <p><strong>Example:</strong> The snowboard in the closet, the one with no stickers on it, needs to be waxed.</p>
          <p><strong>Example:</strong> The basketball team, though, did not mount a comeback this week.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="concept-box">
          <h4>4. Listing</h4>
          <p>Commas are used when listing more than two items and with lists of multiple adjectives modifying the same noun.</p>
          <p><strong>Example:</strong> The group at the picnic table ordered coconut shrimp, hot wings, and onion rings.</p>
          <p><strong>Example:</strong> The old, limping dog still managed to complete the 3-mile hike.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-box">
          <h4>TIP ‚Äì The "Crossing-Out" Trick</h4>
          <p>For unnecessary information commas, you must be able to completely remove the unnecessary information from the sentence. After removing the unnecessary information, what remains must still be a complete sentence that can stand by itself.</p>
          <p><strong>To test if information is unnecessary:</strong> cross out the information and read the sentence without it. If you can cross out the information and the sentence still reads as a complete sentence, the information is unnecessary and needs to be set apart by a comma or commas.</p>
          <p>Let's test with this sentence: <em>The wooden beam, set at an angle, created an optical illusion.</em></p>
          <p>Crossing out "set at an angle": <em>The wooden beam created an optical illusion.</em> ‚úì This works!</p>

      <h3>Subject-Verb Agreement: The Golden Rule</h3>
      <p>Every verb must agree with its subject in number (singular or plural). This sounds simple but the ACT makes it tricky.</p>

      <div class="concept-box">

    content: `
      <p class="lesson-intro">Before we start this book, let's begin by understanding the basic format of the ACT Math Test and general strategies you will need for success.</p>

      <h3>Format of the Test</h3>
      <p>The ACT Math Test consists of one section: a 50-minute section with 45 questions. A calculator is allowed in this section, and you should use your calculator a lot! Even for simple mental math, use the calculator. This will help keep your mind fresh and avoid simple mistakes.</p>

      <h3>Difficulty of the Questions</h3>
      <p>As you progress through the test, the difficulty of the questions increases. The first 5-10 questions in general will be much easier. As you move towards the later questions, the difficulty will increase slightly until around question 30, where the questions will quickly get much more difficult.</p>

      <div class="rules-box">
        <h4>Question Difficulty Breakdown:</h4>
        <table>
          <tr><th>Difficulty</th><th>Question Number</th></tr>
          <tr><td>Very Easy</td><td>1 ‚Äì 5</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Easy</td><td>6 ‚Äì 15</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Medium</td><td>16‚Äì 30</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Hard</td><td>31 ‚Äì 45</td></tr>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h3>Time Management</h3>
      <p>On average, you have just over 1 minute (1 minute and 6 seconds to be exact) to answer each question. Some questions can be solved very quickly while others can take much longer to solve. In general, you should be solving the earlier questions in less than 60 seconds, as the later, more difficult questions will require more time.</p>

      <p>If you get to a question that you do not know how to solve, circle the number, bubble in an answer, and move on. You can always come back to the questions that you circled at the end if you have time left.</p>

      <h3>Guessing</h3>
      <p>There is no penalty for guessing. Make sure that you bubble in an answer for every single question. On a multiple-choice test, there is no best method for guessing, so look at the answer choices and pick the answer that looks best to you.</p>

  'backsolving': {
    title: 'Chapter 1: Working Backwards Strategy',
    duration: 25, // minutes (includes practice test)
    content: `
      <p class="lesson-intro">In the first two chapters, you will learn two important test-taking techniques: backsolving and substitution. As you work through the rest of the book, use these techniques whenever you can to solve questions.</p>

      <p>Backsolving is plugging the answer choices back into the question. On the ACT, you are given 4 answer choices for multiple choice questions, and one of those 4 choices must be correct. Rather than solving the question algebraically and determining whether your answer matches one of the answer choices, you can guess-and-check with the answer choices to find which one is correct.</p>

      <h3>Backsolving can be done using five steps:</h3>
      <div class="rules-box">
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Start with B or C.</strong> Plug the value in the answer choice back into the question. The answer choices are always in order of smallest to largest or largest to smallest so starting in the middle saves you time.</li>
          <li><strong>Solve the question using this value.</strong> Find any other unknowns if necessary.</li>
          <li><strong>If this answer choice works correctly, you're done!</strong> Bubble it in and move on.</li>
          <li><strong>If this answer choice does not work, cross it off.</strong> If you know the correct answer needs to be smaller or larger than the value you just tried, cross off any other incorrect answers.</li>
          <li><strong>Pick one of the remaining answer choices and plug it back into the question.</strong> Repeat this until you find the correct answer. Remember, one of the 4 answer choices must work!</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="example-box">
        <h4>Example 1:</h4>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> If ‚àöx + 10 ‚àí 2‚àöx ‚àí 2 = 0, what is the value of x?</p>
        <p>A. 2 &nbsp;&nbsp; B. 6 &nbsp;&nbsp; C. 14 &nbsp;&nbsp; D. 18</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> The quickest and easiest way to solve this question is backsolving. Finding the correct answer is just a process of guess-and-check. Below, you can see how the correct answer B, when x = 6, makes the equation be true.</p>
        <p>‚àö6 + 10 ‚àí 2‚àö6 ‚àí 2 = 0<br>
        ‚àö16 ‚àí 2‚àö4 = 0<br>
        4 ‚àí 2(2) = 0<br>
        4 ‚àí 4 = 0<br>
        0 = 0</p>
        <p>The answer is B. If we plug in any of the other answer choices, we will get an equation that is not equal on both sides and is incorrect.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="example-box">
        <h4>Example 2:</h4>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Which of the following is a solution to the equation of x¬≥ + 5x¬≤ + 6x = 0?</p>
        <p>A) ‚àí3 &nbsp;&nbsp; B) ‚àí1 &nbsp;&nbsp; C) 1 &nbsp;&nbsp; D) 2</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Most students look at this question and think, "Oh no, I need to factor this to solve." However, the easiest way to solve this question is backsolving! We plug the answer choices into the equation to see which one makes it equal 0.</p>
        <p>When x = ‚àí3: (‚àí3)¬≥ + 5(‚àí3)¬≤ + 6(‚àí3) = 0<br>
        ‚àí27 + 45 ‚àí 18 = 0<br>
        0 = 0</p>
        <p>The answer is A. If we plug in any other answer choices, the equation will not equal 0.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Backsolving With Points</h3>
      <p>For questions with points in the question or answer choices, it is often effective to backsolve with points. For this method, we will use the point(s) to test which equation works correctly. Remember, if a point is on a graph, it must make the equation of the graph true.</p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <h4>When to Use Backsolving</h4>
        <p><strong>Perfect for:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Questions with numerical answer choices</li>
          <li>Word problems that seem complicated</li>
          <li>Equations you can't solve algebraically</li>
          <li>Time-consuming algebraic manipulation</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Skip backsolving when:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Answer choices contain variables</li>
          <li>The algebraic solution is obvious and quick</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <h4>üöÄ Backsolving Success Tips</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Always start with B or C</strong> - Saves time when you need to eliminate</li>
          <li><strong>Be organized</strong> - Write down your work clearly</li>
          <li><strong>Eliminate as you go</strong> - Cross out choices that don't work</li>
          <li><strong>Use process of elimination</strong> - If you know the answer is larger/smaller</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="key-takeaway">
        <h4>The Bottom Line</h4>
        <p>Backsolving often beats algebra on the ACT. When you see numerical answer choices, consider backsolving first. It's frequently faster and less error-prone than complex algebraic manipulation.</p>

    duration: 20, // minutes
    content: `
      <p class="lesson-intro">Do you prefer working with numbers or variables? We would guess your answer is numbers! On the ACT, some questions have many unknown variables and few or no numbers at all. Students often find these questions more difficult. If you prefer to work with numbers, let's work with numbers! With substitution, we substitute simple numbers in for variables and solve the question using numbers instead of relying on more complex algebra with variables.</p>

      <h3>Substitution can be done with these four steps:</h3>
      <div class="rules-box">
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Pick a number for the variable(s) in the question.</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Pick easy numbers‚Ä¶avoid using 0 and 1. Use 2, 3, 4 or other easy numbers. Use 10 for percent problems, 10 or 20 for group size, etc.</li>
              <li>Select different numbers for each variable. For example, if a question has an x and a y, pick x = 2 and y = 3.</li>
              <li>Follow any rules in the question. For example, if a question says x is a number that is negative and even, pick x = ‚àí2.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Write down the number(s) that you have picked.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Use your number(s) to work your way through the question and find your answer.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Plug your number(s) into the answer choices. The correct answer will be the one that matches your answer.</strong></li>
        </ol>

      <div class="example-box">
        <h4>Example 1:</h4>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Jeremy has n boxes of candy bars. Each box contains m bars of candy. Jeremy has to sell 70% of his candy bars to make enough money for rent. Which of the following expresses the number of candy bars Jeremy must sell in terms of m and n?</p>
        <p>A. 0.7(m + n) &nbsp;&nbsp; B. 70nm &nbsp;&nbsp; C. nm + m &nbsp;&nbsp; D. 0.7nm</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> This question may at first seem intimidating with all the variables. To make this question easier, let's plug in numbers. We can say that Jeremy has 2 boxes of candy, so n = 2, and that each box contains 5 bars of candy, so m = 5. With our numbers, Jeremy has a total of 10 candy bars. He needs to sell 70% to make enough money for rent, so we can find the total candy bars that he must sell by finding 70% of 10.</p>
        <p>0.7(10) = 7</p>
        <p>With our numbers, Jeremy must sell 7 candy bars, so our answer is 7. Now, we can plug in the values we selected for n and m into the answer choices and see which one is equal to 7. Here, we find that D works.</p>
        <p>0.7nm = 0.7(2)(5) = 7</p>
        <p>None of the other answer choices are equal to 7 when we plug in our values for n and m. No matter what numbers you pick for n and m, you will find that D is the answer.</p>

        <h4>Example 2:</h4>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> If cos (2x¬∞) = a, which of the following must be true for all values of x, in degrees?</p>
        <p>A. sin(2x¬∞) = a &nbsp;&nbsp; B. sin(x¬∞ + 90¬∞) = a &nbsp;&nbsp; C. cos(90¬∞ ‚àí 2x¬∞) = a &nbsp;&nbsp; D. sin(90¬∞ ‚àí 2x¬∞) = a</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> The easiest way to solve this question is to pick a value for x and use your calculator. Let's pick x = 10¬∞. First, we need to find out what a equals if x = 10¬∞.</p>
        <p>cos(20¬∞) = 0.9397</p>
        <p>Now that we know what a equals, we can plug in x = 10¬∞ for the x-values in the answer choices to see which is equal to 0.9397. Here, we can see how the correct answer choice of D works.</p>
        <p>sin(90¬∞ ‚àí 20¬∞) = sin(70¬∞) = 0.9397</p>
        <p>This trick will work for any value of x that we pick. The answer is D. Note that since we are solving in degrees, your calculator must be in degree mode.</p>

        <p>A. 1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp; B. 2 &nbsp;&nbsp; C. 3 &nbsp;&nbsp; D. 4</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> To make this question easier, we can pick values for the length and width of the rectangle. Let's make the length 3 and the width 2. Now, we just follow the steps in the questions.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The length is tripled: 3(3) = 9. The new length is 9.</li>

        <p>Next, we find the areas of the rectangles and compare. The new rectangle has an area of 9. The original rectangle has an area of 6, so we find that the new rectangle is 1.5 times as large. The answer is A.</p>

      <p class="lesson-intro">Angles and lines are among the most frequently tested geometry topics on the ACT. Master these visual patterns and you'll solve angle questions in seconds. Every ACT includes 4-6 angle problems.</p>

      <h3>Why the ACT Loves Angle Questions</h3>
      <p>Angle problems test logical reasoning and pattern recognition. They're predictable once you know the visual patterns to look for.</p>

      <div class="concept-box">
          <h4>1. Intersecting Lines - The X Pattern</h4>
          <p>When two lines cross, they create four angles with predictable relationships:</p>

          <p>This is the ACT's favorite angle setup! When parallel lines are cut by a transversal, magic happens:</p>

        <h4>TIP ‚Äì Extend Parallel Lines</h4>
        <p>Sometimes questions with parallel lines will not always look like the parallel lines in the figure. If the lines just hit and stop (ex: the corner of a parallelogram), take your pencil and extend the lines yourself to make the question look like the figure above. Then, it will be much easier to tell which angles are identical.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Interior Angles in Polygons</h3>
      <p>You need to know the sum of the interior angles of a‚Ä¶</p>

          <tr><td>Hexagon</td><td>720¬∞</td></tr>
        </table>

        <h4>For any polygon:</h4>
        <p><strong>Sum of Interior Angles = 180¬∞(n - 2)</strong> where n is the number of sides.</p>
      </div>

      <p>It does not matter what the shape looks like. All that matters for the sum of the interior angles is the number of sides.</p>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <h4>TIP ‚Äì All figures are drawn to scale</h4>
        <p><strong>All figures on the ACT are drawn to scale!</strong> You can trust the angles and side lengths in the figure. If you are given a figure and do not know how to solve the question, look at the answer choices to see if you can make an educated guess on which answer looks correct.</p>

        <p>The only exception is if you see, "Note: Figure not drawn to scale." This rarely occurs on the ACT, but in case you do see it, do not trust the figure.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="example-box">
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> In triangle ABC below, the measure of ‚à†ABD is 68¬∞, the measure of ‚à†ACD is 40¬∞, D is on BC, and AD is a bisector of ‚à†BAC. What is the measure of ‚à†ADC?</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> We know that all angles in a triangle add to 180¬∞, so we can use triangle ABC to find ‚à†BAC.</p>
        <p>‚à†BAC + ‚à†ABD + ‚à†ACD = 180¬∞</p>
        <p>Since we are given ‚à†ABD = 68¬∞ and ‚à†ACD = 40¬∞, we can solve for ‚à†BAC.</p>
        <p>‚à†BAC + 68¬∞ + 40¬∞ = 180¬∞</p>
        <p>‚à†BAC = 180¬∞ ‚àí 68¬∞ ‚àí 40¬∞ = 72¬∞</p>
        <p>The question tells us that AD is a bisector of ‚à†BAC. A bisector cuts an angle in half, so we know that ‚à†BAD = ‚à†CAD = 36¬∞</p>
        <p>Now that we know these angles, we can use triangle ADC to find ‚à†ADC. We know that ‚à†ACD = 40¬∞ and ‚à†CAD = 36¬∞. Now we can solve for ‚à†ADC.</p>
        <p>‚à†ADC + 40¬∞ + 36¬∞ = 180¬∞</p>
        <p>‚à†ADC = 180¬∞ ‚àí 40¬∞ ‚àí 36¬∞ = 104¬∞</p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <h4>ACT Angle Strategy</h4>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Look for parallel lines (marked with arrows)</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Find the transversal (line crossing the parallel lines)</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Identify angle relationships (vertical, corresponding, alternate)</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Use given angle to find unknown angles</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Check your work - angles should make sense</p>

      <h3>Areas, Volumes, and Units</h3>
      <p>The ACT loves to ask area or volume questions with various units. The most common are yards and feet or feet and inches. Students often answer these questions incorrectly because they make mistakes with unit conversion, even though the math is very simple.</p>

      <div class="rules-box">
        <h4>Unit Conversions to Memorize:</h4>

          <li><strong>1 cubic yard = 27 cubic feet</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Feet and Inches</h5>
        <ul>

      <p><strong>Key Strategy:</strong> Always convert units BEFORE solving for any area or volume.</p>

      <h3>Volumes of Other Three-Dimensional Solids</h3>
      <p>The volume of any three-dimensional shape can be calculating using the equation <strong>V = B √ó h</strong> where B is the area of the base and h is the height.</p>

      <h3>Right Triangles</h3>
      <div class="rules-box">
        <h4>Pythagorean Theorem:</h4>
        <p><strong>a¬≤ + b¬≤ = c¬≤</strong></p>
        <p>where a and b are the lengths of the legs and c is the hypotenuse. You can only use the Pythagorean Theorem equation for right triangles.</p>

        <h4>Pythagorean Triples:</h4>
        <p>Pythagorean triples are sets of whole numbers that work in the Pythagorean theorem. On the ACT, you should look out for the two common Pythagorean triples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>3, 4, 5 Right Triangle</strong></li>
          <li><strong>5, 12, 13 Right Triangle</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>These triangles can also be scaled up by multiplying all of the side lengths by the same number to create more Pythagorean triples. For example, a 3, 4, 5 right triangle can be doubled to become a 6, 8, 10 right triangle, tripled to become 9, 12, 15, and so on.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Special Right Triangles</h3>
      <p>You will need to be familiar with two special right triangles: 45¬∞ ‚àí 45¬∞ ‚àí 90¬∞ and 30¬∞ ‚àí 60¬∞ ‚àí 90¬∞. The side lengths of these triangles are always in a particular ratio.</p>

        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Since the area of rectangle ABCD and the square are equal, we first find the area of the square.</p>
        <p>A = 12¬≤ = 144</p>
        <p>Now, we know the area of rectangle ABCD is 144 square inches and that one side length is 9 inches, so we can solve for the width using A = lw.</p>
        <p>144 = (9)(w)</p>

        PERCENT EQUATION: Part = Percent √ó Whole

        EXAMPLES:
        ‚Ä¢ What is 25% of 80?
          Part = 0.25 √ó 80 = 20

        ‚Ä¢ 15 is what percent of 60?
          15 = Percent √ó 60
          Percent = 15 √∑ 60 = 0.25 = 25%

        ‚Ä¢ 30% of what number is 12?
          12 = 0.30 √ó Whole
          Whole = 12 √∑ 0.30 = 40

            Percent Change = |New Value - Old Value| / Old Value √ó 100%

            EXAMPLE: Price goes from $40 to $50
            Percent Increase = (50 - 40) / 40 √ó 100% = 10/40 √ó 100% = 25%

            EXAMPLE: Price goes from $80 to $60
            Percent Decrease = (80 - 60) / 80 √ó 100% = 20/80 √ó 100% = 25%

            SHORTCUT FOR CONSECUTIVE CHANGES:
            ‚Ä¢ 20% increase then 10% decrease:

      <h3>Understanding Ratios</h3>
      <p>Ratios compare quantities. They can be written as fractions, with colons, or in words.</p>

      <div class="visual-diagram">
        <h5>üìä Ratio Representations:</h5>
        <pre style="font-family: monospace; line-height: 1.4; background: #f0f8ff; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #2196F3;">
        SAME RATIO, DIFFERENT FORMS:
        ‚Ä¢ Fraction: 3/4
        ‚Ä¢ Colon: 3:4
        ‚Ä¢ Words: "3 to 4"
        ‚Ä¢ Means: "For every 3 of the first, there are 4 of the second"

        EXAMPLE: If a class has 15 boys and 20 girls
        ‚Ä¢ Ratio of boys to girls = 15:20 = 3:4
        ‚Ä¢ Ratio of girls to boys = 20:15 = 4:3
        ‚Ä¢ Ratio of boys to total = 15:35 = 3:7
        </pre>
      </div>

          <h4>Solving Proportions</h4>
          <p>A proportion states that two ratios are equal. Cross-multiply to solve.</p>

            PROPORTION: a/b = c/d

            CROSS-MULTIPLY: a √ó d = b √ó c

            EXAMPLE: x/12 = 5/8
            Cross multiply: x √ó 8 = 12 √ó 5
                           8x = 60
                           x = 7.5

          <h4>Direct and Inverse Variation</h4>
          <p>These show up 1-2 times per ACT in word problems.</p>

        FUNDAMENTAL RELATIONSHIP:
        If a^x = b, then log_a(b) = x

        EXAMPLES:

      <p class="lesson-intro">Mastering passage analysis is crucial for ACT Reading success. Learn to quickly identify main ideas, supporting details, and author's purpose in any passage type.</p>

      <h3>The Big Picture First Approach</h3>
      <p>Before diving into details, understand the passage's overall structure and purpose.</p>

      <div class="visual-diagram">
        <h5>üìñ Passage Analysis Framework:</h5>
        <pre style="font-family: monospace; line-height: 1.4; background: #f0f8ff; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #2196F3;">
        STEP 1: TOPIC - What is this passage about?
        STEP 2: SCOPE - What specific aspect of the topic?
        STEP 3: PURPOSE - Why did the author write this?
        STEP 4: TONE - What's the author's attitude?

        EXAMPLE PASSAGE ANALYSIS:
        Topic: Shakespeare's influence on modern literature
        Scope: How his themes appear in contemporary novels
        Purpose: To demonstrate his lasting relevance
        Tone: Appreciative and analytical
        </pre>
      </div>

      <div class="concept-box">
          <h4>Main Idea vs. Topic</h4>
          <p>Don't confuse these two concepts - the ACT tests both!</p>

          <div class="visual-diagram">
            <h5>üéØ Key Differences:</h5>
            <pre style="font-family: monospace; line-height: 1.4; background: #f0fff0; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #4CAF50;">
            TOPIC: What is the passage about? (broad subject)
            MAIN IDEA: What specific point about the topic?

            EXAMPLE:
            Topic: Climate change
            Main Idea: Climate change requires immediate global cooperation

            PASSAGE CLUES FOR MAIN IDEA:
            ‚Ä¢ What the author emphasizes most
            ‚Ä¢ Ideas repeated throughout
            ‚Ä¢ The conclusion or thesis
            ‚Ä¢ Where the author spends most time
            </pre>

      </div>

      <div class="concept-box">
          <h4>Supporting Details Strategy</h4>

            EXAMPLES: Specific instances that illustrate
            STATISTICS: Numbers that support claims
            EXPERT OPINIONS: Quotes from authorities
            COMPARISONS: Similarities and differences
            CAUSE/EFFECT: How things relate

            READING STRATEGY:
            1. Don't memorize details on first read
            2. Note WHERE details appear
            3. Return when questions ask for specifics
            4. Details support main points - not vice versa
            </pre>

      <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>1. Main Idea Questions</h4>

          STRATEGY:
          1. Look for what the author emphasizes most
          2. Check the introduction and conclusion
          3. Eliminate answers that are too narrow/broad
          4. Choose the answer that covers the whole passage

          WRONG ANSWER TRAPS:
          ‚Ä¢ Too specific (supporting detail instead)
          ‚Ä¢ Too broad (covers more than the passage)
          ‚Ä¢ Not mentioned (introduces new topics)
          ‚Ä¢ Opposite (contradicts the passage)

          ‚Ä¢ Usually incorrect unless context is extreme

          TRAP 4: Outside Knowledge
          ‚Ä¢ Ignore what you know about the word

        CORRECT INFERENCE:
        ‚Ä¢ Based on evidence in the passage
        ‚Ä¢ Logical next step from given information
        ‚Ä¢ Conservative conclusion

        WRONG ASSUMPTION:
        ‚Ä¢ Requires outside knowledge
        ‚Ä¢ Makes huge leaps beyond the text
        ‚Ä¢ Extreme or speculative conclusion

        EXAMPLE:
        Passage: "Sarah checked her watch for the third time and
        tapped her foot nervously."

        GOOD INFERENCE: Sarah is waiting for something/someone
        BAD ASSUMPTION: Sarah is late for a job interview

        The first is supported by evidence; the second adds
        information not in the passage.

          TRAP 1: Too Extreme
          ‚Ä¢ Answers with "always," "never," "all," "none"

          ‚Ä¢ Going beyond what evidence supports

          TRAP 3: Outside Knowledge
          ‚Ä¢ Using real-world facts not in passage
          ‚Ä¢ Bringing in your own opinions/experiences

          TRAP 4: Opposite Direction
          ‚Ä¢ Inferring the reverse of what's suggested

          PASSAGE EXCERPT: "After months of preparation, Maria
          stood at the starting line. Her hands trembled slightly
          as she adjusted her running shoes one final time.
          The crowd's cheers seemed distant, muffled by the
          pounding of her heart."

          QUESTION: The passage suggests that Maria is:

          A) Unprepared for the race
          B) Nervous about the upcoming event
          C) Hearing-impaired and cannot hear the crowd
          D) About to withdraw from the competition

          ANALYSIS:
          Evidence: "hands trembled," "pounding of her heart,"
          "months of preparation"

          A) NO - She prepared for months
          B) YES - Physical signs indicate nervousness
          C) NO - "Muffled by pounding heart" explains sound issue
          D) NO - No evidence of withdrawal

        ELIMINATION METHOD:
        ‚Ä¢ Cross out obviously wrong answers
        ‚Ä¢ Look for answers that are too extreme
        ‚Ä¢ Avoid choices that contradict the passage
        ‚Ä¢ Choose from remaining options

        ANSWER CHOICE PATTERNS:
        ‚Ä¢ Moderate answers are often correct
        ‚Ä¢ Extreme language (always/never) is usually wrong
        ‚Ä¢ Answers that restate passage ideas are often right
        ‚Ä¢ New information not in passage is usually wrong

        WHEN TO GUESS:
        ‚Ä¢ You've eliminated 2+ answer choices
        ‚Ä¢ You're running out of time
        ‚Ä¢ The question is taking too long

        NEVER leave questions blank - no penalty for wrong answers!

          QUESTION: "At what time did the temperature reach 60¬∞C?"

          ANALYSIS:
          1. Locate 60¬∞C on Y-axis
          2. Draw horizontal line to the curve
          3. Drop vertical line to X-axis
          4. Read the time value: approximately 5 minutes

          KEY INSIGHT: Temperature increased rapidly from 0-6 minutes,
          then leveled off. This suggests reaction completion around 6 minutes.

          STEP 1: SCAN THE PASSAGE (30 seconds)
          ‚Ä¢ How many experiments/figures?
          ‚Ä¢ What's the general topic?
          ‚Ä¢ What type of passage is it?

          STEP 2: EXAMINE FIGURES FIRST (60 seconds)
          ‚Ä¢ Read titles and axis labels
          ‚Ä¢ Note general patterns
          ‚Ä¢ Don't analyze details yet

          STEP 3: GO TO QUESTIONS (immediately)
          ‚Ä¢ Read question, then find relevant info
          ‚Ä¢ Only read text sections questions ask about
          ‚Ä¢ Use figures to answer most questions

          STEP 4: READ SELECTIVELY
          ‚Ä¢ Introduction: Basic setup only
          ‚Ä¢ Methods: Only if questions ask
          ‚Ä¢ Results: Let figures show you

          OVERTHINKING SIMPLE QUESTIONS:
          ‚Ä¢ Some questions just ask you to read a graph point
          ‚Ä¢ Don't assume complexity when simplicity works

          USING OUTSIDE KNOWLEDGE:
          ‚Ä¢ Answer based only on passage information
          ‚Ä¢ Your prior science knowledge can mislead you

          MISREADING SCALES:
          ‚Ä¢ Check axis labels and units carefully
          ‚Ä¢ Note if scales start at zero or have breaks

          CONFUSING CORRELATION WITH CAUSATION:
          ‚Ä¢ Variables changing together ‚â† one causes the other
          ‚Ä¢ ACT often tests this distinction

          IGNORING CONTROL GROUPS:
          ‚Ä¢ Control groups are essential for comparisons
          ‚Ä¢ Always identify what the baseline is

          RUSHING THROUGH CONFLICTING VIEWPOINTS:

      <h3>Question Difficulty Pattern</h3>
      <p>Understanding question difficulty helps you manage time effectively:</p>

      <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>Questions 1-20: Easy to Medium</h4>
        <p>These should take 30-45 seconds each. Don't overthink them!</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Basic arithmetic and algebra</li>
          <li>Simple geometry (area, perimeter)</li>
          <li>Straightforward word problems</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="concept-box">
        <h4>Questions 21-40: Medium</h4>
        <p>Allow 60-90 seconds per question. Most students should focus here.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Multi-step algebra problems</li>
          <li>Coordinate geometry</li>
          <li>Basic trigonometry</li>

          <li>Complex multi-step problems</li>
          <li>Advanced trigonometry</li>
          <li>Matrix operations</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <h4>üéØ The ACT Math Strategy</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Use your calculator liberally</strong> - Even for simple arithmetic</li>
          <li><strong>Work through questions 1-40 carefully</strong> - These are your bread and butter</li>
          <li><strong>Don't get stuck</strong> - If a problem takes over 2 minutes, guess and move on</li>
          <li><strong>Circle questions you skip</strong> - Return if time permits</li>
          <li><strong>Guess intelligently</strong> - Eliminate obviously wrong answers first</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <h3>Essential Formulas to Memorize</h3>
      <div class="rules-box">
        <h4>Geometry Essentials</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Area of triangle:</strong> A = ¬Ωbh</li>
          <li><strong>Area of circle:</strong> A = œÄr¬≤</li>
          <li><strong>Circumference:</strong> C = 2œÄr</li>
          <li><strong>Pythagorean theorem:</strong> a¬≤ + b¬≤ = c¬≤</li>
          <li><strong>Distance formula:</strong> d = ‚àö[(x‚ÇÇ-x‚ÇÅ)¬≤ + (y‚ÇÇ-y‚ÇÅ)¬≤]</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Algebra Essentials</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Slope:</strong> m = (y‚ÇÇ-y‚ÇÅ)/(x‚ÇÇ-x‚ÇÅ)</li>
          <li><strong>Quadratic formula:</strong> x = [-b ¬± ‚àö(b¬≤-4ac)]/2a</li>
          <li><strong>FOIL:</strong> (a+b)(c+d) = ac + ad + bc + bd</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="example-box">
        <h4>Time Management Example</h4>
        <p>Sarah has 60 minutes for 60 questions. Here's her smart approach:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Questions 1-20 (20 minutes):</strong> Average 1 minute each, builds confidence</li>
          <li><strong>Questions 21-40 (25 minutes):</strong> Allow extra time for multi-step problems</li>
          <li><strong>Questions 41-60 (15 minutes):</strong> Quick attempts, strategic guessing</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> More correct answers and higher score than rushing through all 60.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="key-takeaway">
        <h4>Success Formula</h4>
        <p>ACT Math success = (Solid fundamentals) + (Strategic time management) + (Calculator efficiency) + (Smart guessing). Focus on getting questions 1-40 right rather than attempting all 60 quickly.</p>

        <h4>PROSE FICTION: This passage is adapted from the novel "Coming of Age" by Maria Rodriguez (\u00a9 2018 by Rodriguez Publishing).</h4>
        <p>Elena had always thought that turning eighteen would feel different, more significant somehow. But as she sat in the cramped diner booth across from her childhood best friend Marcus, she felt exactly the same as she had the day before her birthday. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting an unflattering glow on the chipped formica table between them.</p>

        <p>"You're being dramatic," Marcus said, stirring sugar into his coffee with more force than necessary. "College is going to be amazing. You've wanted to study journalism since we were twelve."</p>

        <p>Elena picked at her untouched sandwich. The truth was more complicated than Marcus understood. Yes, she had dreamed of being a reporter, of traveling to distant places and telling important stories. But those dreams had been formed in the safety of her small hometown, where the biggest news was the annual corn festival or the occasional traffic accident on Route 12.</p>

        <p>"What if I'm not cut out for it?" she asked quietly. "What if I get to the university and realize I'm just a small-town girl who doesn't belong?"</p>

        <p>Marcus set down his spoon and looked at her seriously for the first time that evening. "Elena, you wrote that series about the factory closings that got picked up by three regional newspapers. You're not just dreaming anymore\u2014you're already doing it."</p>
