      <h3>Transform Your ACT Journey Into Academic Success</h3>
      <p>The ACT represents far more than a standardized test—it's your gateway to demonstrating academic excellence and securing educational opportunities. This comprehensive assessment evaluates your mastery across four critical academic pillars: English proficiency, mathematical reasoning, reading comprehension, and scientific analysis. Through strategic preparation, you'll transform this academic challenge into your most powerful competitive advantage.</p>

      <h3>Mastering the ACT Architecture</h3>
      <p>The ACT examination features four precisely structured sections, each engineered to assess distinct academic capabilities:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>English Mastery (45 minutes, 75 questions):</strong> Tests grammar mastery, usage proficiency, punctuation precision, and rhetorical sophistication</li>
          <li><strong>Mathematical Reasoning (60 minutes, 60 questions):</strong> Assesses algebraic fluency, geometric understanding, and trigonometric problem-solving</li>
          <li><strong>Reading Excellence (35 minutes, 40 questions):</strong> Evaluates comprehension mastery and analytical reasoning across varied academic passages</li>
          <li><strong>Scientific Analysis (35 minutes, 40 questions):</strong> Measures data interpretation abilities and scientific reasoning prowess</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Understanding Your Score Potential</h3>
      <p>Each section generates a scaled score ranging from 1 to 36 points. Your composite score represents the average of these four section scores. While most colleges accept scores above 20, elite institutions typically require composite scores of 30 or higher for competitive admission consideration.</p>

      <h3>Your Elite Preparation Strategy</h3>
      <p>Championship-level test preparation requires a systematic approach incorporating:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Thorough diagnostic assessment to identify performance strengths and targeted improvement areas</li>
          <li>Strategic time investment focusing on sections with maximum score enhancement potential</li>
          <li>Section-specific tactical methodologies and optimized time management techniques</li>
          <li>Consistent full-length practice testing to build endurance and test-day confidence</li>
          <li>Comprehensive error analysis to master correct reasoning approaches</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Core principle: Methodical, consistent preparation significantly outperforms cramming. Prioritize your weakest areas while systematically strengthening all sections for maximum score improvement.</p>

            <h3>Why Sentence Structure Dominates the ACT</h3>
            <p>Every ACT English test features 12-18 sentence structure questions. Test makers evaluate your ability to distinguish complete thoughts from incomplete ones and connect them effectively.</p>

            <h3>Essential Foundation: Recognizing Sentence Components</h3>
            <p>Before mastering ACT questions, you must identify the two fundamental sentence types. Each requires a subject (who/what) and a predicate (action/description):</p>

                </div>

                <p>Independent clauses represent complete ideas capable of standing alone as sentences. They contain both subject and predicate while expressing finished thoughts.</p>

                <h4>Phrases: The Supporting Elements</h4>
                <p>A <strong>phrase</strong> lacks either a subject or predicate (or both). These function as supporting details rather than complete thoughts, adding information without creating sentences independently.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples of incomplete phrases:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Running toward the finish line... (who is running?)</li>
                    <li>Creating comprehensive study schedules... (who is creating?)</li>
                    <li>Reviewing it carefully... (who reviewed what?)</li>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>Simple Completeness Test</h4>
                <p>Use this reliable method: Read each part aloud. If it feels natural to stop reading, you have an independent clause. If you feel compelled to continue, it's either dependent or just a phrase.</p>
                <p>For dependent vs. phrase distinction: Cover the opening word and read the remainder. If it becomes complete, you had a dependent clause. If still incomplete, it was merely a phrase.</p>
                <p><strong>Practice examples:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Complete thought:</strong> My study partner reviews concepts daily.</li>
                    <li><strong>Needs completion:</strong> When my study partner reviews concepts daily...</li>
                    <li><strong>Missing elements:</strong> Reviewing concepts daily...</li>

            </div>

            <h3>Correcting Incomplete Sentences</h3>
            <p>Sometimes sentences fail because they lack essential components. <strong>Sentence fragments</strong> resemble broken mechanisms - they lack necessary parts to function properly.</p>
            <p>Your instincts often detect these because they sound unnatural. Trust your ear for what sounds complete!</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Broken:</strong> The student rushing to complete the assignment. <em>(What did the student DO?)</em></p>
                <p><strong>Fixed:</strong> The student rushing to complete the assignment submitted it early.</p>
                <p><strong>Broken:</strong> Determined to excel on the exam. <em>(WHO is determined?)</em></p>
                <p><strong>Fixed:</strong> My classmate Sarah is determined to excel on the exam.</p>

            <p class="lesson-intro">Comma questions appear 8-12 times per ACT English test, making comma mastery essential for score improvement. Master these systematic rules and you'll handle comma questions with complete confidence.</p>

            <h3>The Strategic Approach to ACT Commas</h3>
            <p>The ACT tests comma usage through predictable patterns. Rather than memorizing hundreds of rules, focus on these high-frequency situations that appear repeatedly on every test.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>🎯 Rule #1: Essential vs. Non-Essential Information</h4>
                <p>This represents the most tested comma concept on the ACT. Identify whether information is essential (no commas) or additional (commas required).</p>

                <div class="visual-demo">
                    <div class="essential-example">
                        <div class="sentence">Students <strong>who practice regularly</strong> achieve higher scores.</div>
                        <div class="explanation">Essential: Identifies WHICH students - no commas needed</div>
                    </div>

                        <div class="explanation">Non-essential: Additional information about already-identified person - commas required</div>
                    </div>

                <div class="test-strategy">
                    <h5>🔍 The ACT Decision Test:</h5>
                    <p>Remove the phrase in question. If the sentence meaning changes significantly, it's essential (no commas). If the meaning stays the same, it's non-essential (use commas).</p>

            <p class="lesson-intro">Verb questions appear 8-12 times per ACT English test, covering tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and voice. Mastering verb usage dramatically improves your writing precision and ACT scores.</p>

            <h3>The ACT's Verb Testing Strategy</h3>
            <p>The ACT tests verbs through three primary areas: tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and active vs. passive voice. Understanding these patterns helps you quickly identify and correct verb errors.</p>

                <h4>⏰ Tense Consistency Mastery</h4>

            <p class="lesson-intro">Pronoun questions appear 6-10 times per ACT English test, testing reference clarity, agreement, and proper case usage. Mastering pronouns eliminates ambiguity and demonstrates sophisticated writing skills.</p>

            <h3>The ACT's Pronoun Testing Framework</h3>
            <p>The ACT evaluates pronouns through three critical areas: clear antecedent reference, proper agreement, and correct case usage. Understanding these principles ensures pronoun precision throughout your writing.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>🎯 Clear Reference Mastery</h4>
                <p>Every pronoun must clearly refer to a specific antecedent (the noun it replaces). Ambiguous references create confusion and weaken writing effectiveness.</p>

                  <li>Contractions: replace missing letters (don't, can't, it's)</li>
                  <li>Never use apostrophes: its, yours, theirs, hers, ours</li>
