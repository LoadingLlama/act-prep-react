Chapter 33: Shifting and Transforming Functions
On the ACT, you need to know how lines, parabolas, cubics, and other functions shift and transform in the
(x, y) coordinate plane.

Rules for Shifting and Transforming Functions
1.

Numbers inside the parentheses shift a function horizontally. Adding a number shifts a
function that many units to the left and subtracting a number shifts a function that many units to
the right.

2.

Numbers outside the parentheses shift a function vertically. Adding a number shifts a
function that many units up and subtracting a number shifts a function that many units down.

3.

A negative sign in front of a function flips the function vertically over the x-axis.

4.

A coefficient in front of the function causes a vertical transformation. Ifthe coefficient is
greater than 1, it causes a vertical stretch. If the coefficient is less than 1, it causes a vertical
compression.

All functions follow these same rules. As long as you memorize the rules above, you will be able to solve

questions with shifts and transformations of lines, parabolas, cubics, or any other type of function.

Example 1: The graph of 4x + 2y = 26 is shifted up 4 units. What is the y-coordinate of the resulting
y-intercept?
A.

13

B.

17

D. 22

D. 30

Solution: First, we need to turn the line from standard form to slope-intercept form. To do this, we isolate y.
First, we subtract the 4x to get
2y = —4x + 25

Next, we divide by 2 to get
y=-—2x4+13

The original equation has a y-intercept at (0,13). If we shift the graph up 4 units, we move the y-intercept up

4 units, so the y-intercept is at (0,17). The answer is B.

X-axis.

Notice how the graph of the original f(x) = x? function follows the shifting rules we just learned. For the
horizontal shift with the —2 in parentheses, we see the graph shift 2 units right. The vertical shift of —3

outside the parentheses shifts the graph 3 units down. The vertical stretch makes the graph steeper while the
vertical compression flattens the graph. And finally, the negative sign in from flips the graph over the x-axis.

Example 2: The function f(x) is shown in the graph to the right. If

g(x) = f(x + 2) + 3, what is the value of g(1) ?

B.

1

C.

2

D.

3

Solution: The function f(x + 2) + 3 shifts the original f(x) function 2 units left and 3 units up. To find
g(1), we have to find the point on f(x) that is shifted 2 units left and 3 unit up to become g(1).
The easiest way to do this is to find the x-value of the point on f(x) that is shifted to g(1). At g(1), the
x-value is 1. To find the x-value of the point on f(x), we can reverse the shift and shift 2 unit right from

x = 1tox = 3. So, we know the point that ends up at g(1) starts at f(3). The point at f(3) is (3, —1).
Now, we can follow the shifts to find g(1). If we shift this point 2 units left and 3 units up, the point (3, —1)

is translated to (1,2). So,

f(1) = 2 and the answer is C.

Cubics
Below, we can see how the cubic function f(x) = x? follows the same rules for shifts and transformations.

All Other Functions
All functions follow the same basic rules for shifting. The ACT can ask you questions about very weird

looking functions. Remember that these functions still follow the same rules for shifts and transformations as
the parabolas and cubics that we just reviewed.

over the x-axis.

In function notation, the shifts still follow the same rules. In this example, it is easiest to see the shifts by

picking a starting point on the original function f(x). Let’s look at the point the corner located at (—2, 2) and
see how the function shifts from there.
For the horizontal shift, the +2 in the parentheses shifts the function left 2 units, so the corner is now at

(—4, 2). The vertical shift, the —3 outside the parentheses, shifts the function down 3 units, so the corner
moves to (—2,—1). The vertical stretch makes the function steeper, and the vertical compression makes the
function flatter. The negative sign in front causes a vertical flip over the x-axis, so the entire function is

flipped upside down and the corner point is now located at (—2, —2).
