Chapter 9: Percentages
On the ACT, you will need to know how to solve questions with simple percentages and with percentage
increases and decreases. While percentages may seem simple, they can often stump students who do not know
how to set them up correctly. This chapter will show you all the skills you need to know to handle percentage
questions quickly and easily on test day.

Simple Percentages
Simple percentage questions can be solved by properly setting up a proportion:
new

#£%

original

100

You can think of the “original” as the starting value (the 100%) and the “new” as the percentage of the starting
value. If you are given a percentage value, always put it where the % 1s.
Example 1: Isaiah purchased a new watch for 72% of the original price. Isaiah paid no sales tax. Ifthe

original price was $160, which of the following is closest to the price Isaiah paid for the watch?
A.

45

B. 88

C.

115

D.

138

Solution: Method #1 — Proportion: To solve, we set up a proportion:

_x_ _ 74
160

100

100x = 11,520

= 2"
= 115.20
100
Isaiah paid $115.20 for the watch. The answer is C.
Solution: Method #2 — Decimal Shortcut: We can also turn percentages into decimals by dividing the
percentage value by 100.

120% is the same as 1.2. 85% is the same as 0.85. Here, we can turn the 72% into

0.72. Let the price Isaiah paid for the watch be p. Isaiah paid 72% of the original price of $160 so
p = 0.72(160)
p= 115.2
Isaiah paid $115.20 for the watch.

Example 2: Joey buys a new set of golf clubs for $720 when the clubs are on sale for 80% of the original
price. What was the original price, in dollars, of the set of golf clubs?
A.

576

B. 648

C. 864

D. 900

Solution: Method #1 — Proportion: To solve, we can set up a proportion:
720 _

x

80

100

80x = 72,000
x=

72,000
80

= 900

The answer is D.

-72-

Chapter 9: Percentages

Method #2 — Decimal Shortcut: For this question, we can turn 80% in 0.8 and solve:
0.8x = 720

x

—2°
= 900
0.8

The answer is D. We recommend the decimal shortcut, as it is faster for solving percentage questions.
The ACT can also ask you to deal with multiple percent changes in the same question. To solve these
questions the fastest, you should do all the percent changes together in one step.
Example 3: Fred is trying to sell his bicycle, but he is having a hard time finding someone interested in

buying it. To sell the bicycle quickly, Fred decides to sell the bicycle for 95% of the original price to
Dave. Dave sells the bicycle 6 months later for 80% of the price that he purchased the bicycle for from
Fred. The price that Dave sells the bicycle for is what percent of the original price of the bicycle?
A.

90

B. 87.5

C. 80

D. 76

Solution: Method 1 — “Math Teacher Way”: Let the original price of the bicycle be p. When Fred sells the
bicycle to Dave for 95% of the original price, you multiply by 0.95. When Dave later sells the bicycle for 80%
of the purchase price, you multiply by 0.8. The final price that Dave sold the bicycle for is then:
p(0.95)(0.8) = 0.76p
The final price is 76% of the original price. The answer is D.

Method 2 — Plug In Numbers: The part about this question that confuses most students is that we are never
given any actual price for the bicycle. To make this question easier, pick an original price for the bicycle and

use that price to solve. Let’s say the original price of Fred’s bicycle $100. 100 is always a good number to
pick for percentage problems because it is easy to calculate percent changes from 100. Since Dave buys the
bicycle for 95% of the original price, Dave pays $95 for the bicycle. Dave then sells the bicycle for 80% of the

$95, so you can solve for the final price:
Final Price = 0.8(95) = 76
The final price is $76. Since the original price was $100, the final price is 76% of the original price. The
answer is D.

Percentage Increase and Decrease
Percentage questions are more difficult when there is an increase or a decrease to the percentage, but you can
still set them up as a proportion.
Percentage greater than:

New

—_

Original

=

100+ %

Percentage less than:

100

New

———

Original

=

100 -%

100

The “original” is the starting value (the 100%), and the “new” is the percentage increase or decrease from the

starting value. If you are given a percentage value, you always put it in where the % sign 1s.
Example 1: Jarvis construction company is building a new exit ramp for the local highway. The
company initially said that the project would take 250 days, but a forecast for bad winter weather led the
company to estimate that the project would take 12% longer to finish. How many days does Jarvis now
estimate that the new exit ramp will take to complete?
A.

280

B. 276

C. 262

Dz. 260

Solution: The original estimate is 250 days. We are asked to find the new estimate, which is represented by x
below. Since the estimate 1s that it will take 12% longer to finish, we put 12 in for the % in the percentage
greater than equation above and then solve for x.
x

100+12

250

+

~=3=6100

100x = (250)(112)
— (250)(112)
= 99 = 280
The answer is A.

It is also important to know the shortcut for solving percentage increase and decrease questions. Let’s

say you want to increase x by 30%. Normally if we want to increase x by 30%, you will find 30% of the value
and then add it to x:
x+0.3x

This is the same as

x+0.3x = x(14+ 0.3) = 1.3x
Instead of finding 30% of x and adding it to the original value, you can simply multiply x by 1.3. This
trick will work for any percent value. To increase a value by 4%, multiply by 1.04. To decrease a value by
10%, multiply by 0.9. This technique will help you solve percentage increase and decrease questions more

quickly and effectively on the ACT.
Both this decimal shortcut technique and the proportion technique work, so you should use the one that you are
most comfortable with.
Example 2: Tim grew 15% more tons of tomatoes in 2019 than in 2018. If Tim’s grew 23 tons of

tomatoes in 2019, approximately how many tons of tomatoes did Tim grow in 2018?
A.

26.5

B. 24.5

C. 21.5

D. 20

Solution: Here, let’s use the decimal shortcut technique. To increase by 15%, we multiply by 1.15.

(1.15)(tons in 2018) = tons 2019
(1.15)(tons in 2018) = 23

Chapter 9: Percentages

The answer is D.

Example 3: The price of a painting decreased by 8% in 2017, increased by 25% in 2018, and increased

by 40% in 2019. What percentage greater is the price of the painting in 2019 than the original price at the
beginning of 2017?
A.

73

B. 61

C. 57

D.

48

Solution: Method #1 — “Math Teacher Way”: Let the original price of the painting be p. When the price is

decreased by 8% in 2017, we multiply by (1 — 0.08) because it is the original price minus 8%. When the
price is increased by 25% in 2018, we multiply by (1 + 0.25) because we are adding 25% onto the price from
2017. When the price is increased by 40% in 2019, we multiply by (1 + 0.40) because we are adding 40%
onto the price from 2018. The final price is then:

p(1 — 0.08)(1 + 0.25)(1 + 0.40) = p(0.92)(1.25)(1.40) = 1.61p
The 1.61p shows that the price in 2019 is 61% higher than the price in 2017. The answer is B.

Method #2 — Substitution: To make this question easier, we can pick an original price for the painting. Since

this is a percentage question, let’s say the original price is $100. Now, let’s go through the steps of the
question. First, the percentage decreased by 8% in 2017, so we multiply $100 by (1 — 0.08) to find the price
is $92 in 2017. In 2018, the price increases by 25%, so we multiply the $92 by (1 + 0.25) to find the price is

$115 in 2018. Finally, in 2019 the price increases by 40%, so we multiple the $115 by (1 + 0.4) to find the
price is $161in 2019.

We know that the initial price was $100 and the final price in 2019 was $161. To find the percentage change
we can use the following equation.
Percentage Change =

Final Value — Initial Value
Initial Value

x

100

If the percentage change is a positive number, it is a percentage increase. If the percent change is a negative
number, it is a percentage decrease. Plugging in our numbers, we get
161 — 100

Percentage Change = —t00

x 100 = 61%

The price increased by 61%, so the answer is B.

Example 4: In 2017, the average price of an avocado in California was $1.43. In 2018, the average price

of an avocado in California was $1.54. Which of the following is closest to the percentage increase of the
price of an avocado from 2017 to 2018?
A. 7.1%

B. 7.7%

C. 8.2%

D. 8.4%

Solution:
