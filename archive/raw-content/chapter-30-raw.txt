Chapter 30: Scientific Notation
Scientific notation is used to express numbers that are too big or too small to be easily written in decimal form.

For example, instead of writing 15,000,000, we can write 1.5 x 10”. You have likely learned scientific
notation before, so in this chapter we will review how to write numbers in scientific notation.

How To Write Numbers in Scientific Notation
Scientific notation is always written as a product of two numbers: the digit term and the exponential

term. The base of the exponential term is always 10. Using our example from above, we can identify these
different numbers.

15,000,000 = 1.5 x 10”
The 1.5 is the digit term and the 107 is the exponential term. The digit term must always be greater than or
equal to 1 and less than 10.

So how did we turn 15,000,000 into 1.5 x 107? It’s all about counting how many places we move the
decimal point, as the number of places we move the decimal point tells us the power in the exponential term.
In the original number 15,000,000, the decimal is located at the end of the number. To turn this into scientific

notation, we need to move the decimal between the | and the 5.

15,000,000.
UUW

= 1.5 x 107

<q—__

The decimal point moves 7 spots to the left, so the power in the exponential term is 7. When moving the
decimal to the left, the power in the exponential term is positive. Here are two more examples:

201,000.

Example 1: The MLB estimates that 250,000 baseballs are used during an entire season. Which of the
following expressions, when written in scientific notation, correctly represents the number of baseballs

used during a season?

A. 2.5 x 104

B. 2.5 x 10°

C. 2.5 x 10°

D. 25 x 104

Solution: To solve, we need to turn 250,000 into scientific notation. To do so, the decimal point moves 5
spots to the left.

250,000.
WOU

= 2.5 x 10°

The answer is B. Answer choice D is incorrect because the digit term, the 25 in these answer choices, is too
large. In scientific notation, the digit term must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10.
Ok, so we know how to write large numbers in scientific notation. What about small numbers less than 1? We
use the same approach, except now we must move the decimal point to the right.

0.000916
LULL

= 9.16 x 1074

The decimal point moves 4 spots to the right, so the power in the exponential term is —4. When moving the
decimal to the right, the power in the exponential term is negative. Here are two more examples:

0.0000005

Litt 1 I}

= 5x 107’

0.000036 = 3.6x 107°
LLL}

Notice how we move the decimal point to the right until we get a number for the digit term that is greater than
or equal to 1 and less than 10. Depending on the exact number, you may have to move the decimal all the way
to the end, as with 0.0000005 or not, as with 0.000036 and 0.000916.

Example 2: During an experiment, Ronald found that the average weight of an ant is 0.0000029 kg. The

average weight of an ant in kilograms is equal to 2.9 x 10*. What is the value of k ?
A. 7

B. 6

C. —6

D. —7

Solution: To solve for k, we need to write the average weight of an ant in scientific notation.

0.0000029
LLL

= 2.9x 107°

We need to move the decimal 6 spots to the right, so the power in the exponential term is —6. The answer is
C.

Chapter 31: Arcs and Sectors
Arcs and sectors questions occasionally appear on the ACT. This topic is not as commonly tested as the rest of
the geometry concepts we covered in Chapters 3-4, but it is one that you should still be familiar with for test
day.

Arcs
The arc of a circle is a portion of the circumference. Arcs can be measured in two ways: the degree measure of
the arc or the length of the arc itself.

The degree measure of an arc is equal to the measure of the central angle intersecting the arc. The arc
length is the actual distance covered moving from point A to point B along the circle.

To solve arc questions, you need to memorize the two equations below. These are different versions of the
same equation. Being familiar with both the conceptual idea and the actual equation well help you solve
different types of arc questions on the ACT.
