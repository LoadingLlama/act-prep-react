Exponents
Let’s start by reviewing the common exponent rules that you need to know on the ACT.

Make sure that you memorize all of these rules for test day. The product, quotient, and power rules will be
tested most often, but you also need to know the fraction power rule and negative exponent rule for more
difficult questions. To successfully solve exponent questions, you will need to use multiple of these rules
together.

Example 1: For all nonzero x and y, the expression Textys |S equivalent to:

:

8

By7

8

”

14x4

Solution: To solve, we use the quotient rule for the exponents. For the numbers, we follow normal algebra

rules to simplify, so = simplifies to =

Using the negative exponent rule, we get

By?

The answer is B. A good trick with negative exponents is that if we switch the term from a numerator to the
denominator or vice versa, the negative power turns into a positive power. In the last step of the solution to

Example 1, the y~” term in the denominator switches to y”? when we move the term from the numerator to the
denominator.

Example 2: For all nonzero x and y, which of the following is equal to — ?
A.

—2xy®

— B. —2x?y>

C. 4xy®

D. 4x2y°

Solution: Here, it is easiest to start with the power rule and simplify the numerator. Make sure that you
remember to distribute the power to all the terms including the —2 at the front.

Ax*y 6
x

Now, we use the quotient rule to simplify the x-terms.
Axy

6

The answer is C.

Example 3: If 4°*+1 = 4-**7, what is the value of x?

A=

BI

C |wN

D. 2

Solution: In this question, the bases are the same, so the exponents must be equal.
3x4+1=-x+7
4x =6
3

x=2

The answer is C.

Example 4: For what value of x is 92% = 27*** true?

A 122 B8 C4 D3

Solution: Method #1 — “Math Teacher Way”: To use any of our exponent rules, we need the bases of our

exponents to be equal. The trick to this question is to recognize that 9 is the same as 32 and 27 is the same as
33, so we can make the bases of both terms 3. Plugging in 3 for 9 and 3° for 27, we get
(37)2* _— (33)*t4
34x — 33x+12

Since the terms are equal, we can set the exponents equal and solve.
4x =3x+12
x=12
The answer is A.

Method #2 — Backsolve with your Calculator: Since we are given an equation and possible values of x, we
can plug the answer choices in for x and use a calculator to see which one makes the equation true. Only one
answer will work, so we can find which answer choice is correct without doing any actual math!

For this question, if we plug in x = 12 to the original equation, 92* and 277° will give us the same answer on
your calculator. The numbers are very large, but you should still be able to tell that they are equal. The
answer is A.

Roots
On the ACT, you will need to often simplify and solve equations with roots. Let’s begin by reviewing the
common root rules:

Jxy = vx xy

V18 = V9 x V2 = 3v2

75
x

wnfern?

Vx

24

To simplify a square root, factor the number underneath the radical and take out any pairs.

V50=vV5x5x2=5vV2
In the example above, there is a pair of 5’s underneath the radical, so we can take the 5 out. The 2 is not part
of a pair, so it stays underneath the radical. Here’s one more example:

V108 = V2x2x3x3xX3 = (2x3)
v3 = 6v3
Here, we have a pair of 2’s and a pair of 3’s, so we take both out and move them to the front. The third 3 is not
part of a pair, so it says underneath the radical.
For some questions, you might need to go backwards and put a number outside back underneath the radical.
To do this, take the number outside and put it back under the radical as a pair.

6V3 = V6x6x3=V108
Example 5: If V45 + V/20 = xvV5, then x =?
A.

5

B. 6

C. 9

D.

13

Solution: We need to simplify the radicals on the left side of the equation.

V45 = V3 X3x5=3v5
-114-

Chapter 13: Exponents and Roots

V¥20 = V2x2x5=2v5
Plugging those values in to the left side of the equation, we get

3V5 + 2V5 =xv5

5V5 =xv5
x=5
The answer is A.

“Cheat Method” — Use Your Calculator and Backsolve: You can also plug inv45 + ¥20 to find out what

it equals. We can then backsolve with the answer choices to find which answer choice, when multiplied by V5
gives us the same value in the calculator. You can also use this method for Example 6.

Example 6: If /2x = 5¥6, then x =?
A.

450

B.

150

C. 75

©)
D. 30

Solution: Method #1: To solve for x, move the 5 back underneath the radical.

Vv2x =V6x5x5
vV2x = ¥150
For these to be equal, the terms under the radical must be equal, so
2x = 150
x=75
The answer is C.

Method #2: We can also solve this question by squaring both sides.

(V2x)? = (Sv6)?
2x =25x6
2x
= 150
x=75
The answer is C.

Remember, these same rules still apply to roots other than just square roots.

Vxy = Vx x4/y

V16 = V8 x V2 =2V2

sfx _ Vx

5f5 _ M5 _ 5

-32.—~C:«S

To simplify a cube root, factor underneath the radical and take out triples of the same number.

V24 = V2x2x2x3
= 23
To simplify a 4th root, factor underneath the radical and take out four of the same number.

V80 = V2x2x2x2x5=2V5
You are unlikely to see any higher roots on the ACT, but if you do just follow this same pattern to simplify any
root.

Example 7: Ifa = ¥162 and b = V40, thena + b =?

A.

3V18+2V10

B. 2V20+2V5

= C. 6V2+5V2

sD. 33V6 +25

Solution: Method #1 — “Math Teacher Way”: To start, let’s simplify to find the value of a.

a= 162 = V3x3x3x6=3V6
Now, simplify D.

b= V40 = V2x2x2x5=2V5
We can solve

atb=3V6+2V5
The answer is D.

Method #2 — Use Your Calculator: We can also cheat this question by using the calculator. You can enter

162 +

40 in your calculator. If your calculator does not have a cube root button, you can convert the cube
1

1

roots to the one third power and enter it as (162)3 + (40)3. Either way, your calculator will tell you that

¥162 + V40 = 8.8713. Next, you can enter the answer choices to see which answer choice also equals
8.8713. If you enter 36 + 2¥5, you will get 8.8713, so the answer is D. None of the answer choices equal
8.8713.

Roots and Variables with Powers
When you have exponent questions with roots and variables with powers underneath the root, it is easiest to
turn the root into a power and then use the exponent rules to solve. For example,

3 i

4

u

3

Vx8y = (x5y)3 = (x°)3y3 = x3y3

The example above can also be solved using our fraction power rule, but this same trick will help make more
complicated questions much easier.

Example 8: Which of the following is equivalent to (/5x®y18 ?

A.

V5x?y6

B. V5x8y

OC. 4/5

x3 yl5

D. 5x7y®

Solution: To start, turn the root into an exponent.
1

(Sx°y"*)3
Next, distribute the exponent to all terms.
1

1

1

(Sx°y!®)3 = 53 (x°)3 (y**)3
Use the exponent rules to solve.
1

1

13

53 (x°)3 (yi)3 = V5 x?y®
The answer is A.
