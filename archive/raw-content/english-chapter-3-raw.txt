Chapter 3: Semicolons, Colons, Dashes, Apostrophes, and
Quotation Marks
Semicolons
Semicolons are used to separate two independent clauses. On the ACT, just remember that:
Semicolon = period
If we can replace a semicolon with a period, then it is used correctly! In other words, everything before
the semicolon must stand as a complete sentence on its own, and everything after the semicolon must
stand as a complete sentence on its own.
Incorrect: My boss called me; asking that I pick up coffee for him.
(2d half of the sentence is not an independent clause)
Incorrect: After my boss called me; he asked that I pick up coffee for him.
(1st half of sentence is not an independent clause)
Incorrect: My boss called me, he asKed that I pick up coffee for him.
(comma splice - cannot connect two independent clauses with a comma)
Correct: My boss called me; he asKed that I pick up coffee for him.
(two independent clauses separated by a semicolon)

Semicolons Practice:

Exposure to sunlight is important for the human body (, / ; ) sunlight stimulates the production
of vitamin D.

2.

Colons
A colon can be used to introducea list of multiple items, a list of one item, an example, an
explanation, a clarification, or a definition. Examples of all of these types are below:
Correct:

I went to the grocery store to pick up some items for dinner: chicken, cheese, and onions.

Correct:

I went to the market to get lunch: a turkey sandwich.

Correct:

He got what he deserved: a one-week suspension without pay.

Correct:

Chocolate milk is a great recovery drink after a hard workout: it has the carbohydrates
and proteins that muscles need to recover.

In order for a colon to be correct, we must follow three basic rules:
1.

The part of the sentence before a colon must be an independent clause. If the part of the
sentence before the colon cannot stand as a complete sentence by itself, it is always incorrect.
Incorrect: The slide showing the most popular car colors in 2018: white, gray, and black.
Correct: The slide shows the most popular car colors in 2018: white, gray, and black.
Incorrect: The hairstylist excelled in: cuts, coloring, and highlights.
Correct: The hairstylist excelled in cuts, coloring, and highlights.

2.

Everything after a colon must consist of only the items in the list, an example, an explanation,
a Clarification, or a definition. The sentence cannot continue to other topics.
Incorrect: Will brought his lunch to the beach: a roast beef sandwich, and he brought his friend Joey
a turkey club.
Correct:

Will brought his lunch to the beach: a roast beef sandwich. He brought his friend Joey a
turkey club.

3.

Colons are NEVER used with “including,”

not

“such as,” and “for example.” If you ever see a colon

before or after any of these, it is always incorrect!
Incorrect: I went to the grocery store to pick up some items for dinner, including: chicken, cheese,
and onions.
Incorrect: I went to the grocery store to pick up some items for dinner: including chicken, cheese,
and onions.
Incorrect: Certain plants grow well in winter: for example garlic, leeks, radishes, and potatoes.
Incorrect: My favorite dishes to cook: such as chicken parmesan, cheesesteaks, and mac-and-cheese,
always include cheese.
Incorrect: The study relied on techniques such as: direct observation and surveying.

If a list is introduced by “including” or “for example,” use a comma. This works because the list now
is unnecessary information. For “such as,” we can use a comma or have no comma depending on
the sentence.
Correct: I went to the grocery store to pick up some items for dinner, including chicken, cheese,
and onions.
Correct: Certain plants grow very well in winter, for example garlic, leeks, radishes, and potatoes.
Correct: My favorite dishes to cook, such as chicken parmesan, cheesesteaks, and mac-and-cheese,
always include cheese.
Correct: The study relied on techniques such as direct observation and surveying.

TIP - Colons and Clauses
A colon can join two independent clauses if the second clause after the colon acts as a definition,
an example, an explanation, or a clarification of the first clause. This is an advanced grammar rule
that rarely appears on the ACT.
Correct: Buddy got what he worked for: he really deserved that promotion.
Correct: My father gave me one rule to live by: honesty is always the best policy.
Since we are connecting two independent clauses, the examples above also would be correct with a
semicolon, a period, or a comma + FANBOYS. However, sometimes the colon is the only correct option
given in the answer choices.

Semicolons, Colons, and Commas Practice: Select which punctuation is correct. Some questions may
have multiple correct answers.
1.

James knew exactly how to make spaghetti (, / ; /: ) boil water, add salt, and then add the pasta.

2.

There’s only one way to truly get a dog’s attention (, /: / ;) food.

horseback riding, debate team, and volunteer work.
Honda’s new compact cars are known for being fuel efficient (, /; /:) each one gets more than
25 miles per gallon.
The order was requested six weeks ago (, /; / : ) we expected the sofa, chairs, and table to have
arrived by now.
The Italian flag has three colors (, /; /: ) green, white, and red.
The directions were clear (, /; / : ) place cookie dough onto the tray, place in the oven, and cook

determine the precise age of an object containing organic material.

(,/;/:) only true experts know how to hit all of notes on a harmonica.

Dashes
Dashes can function like unnecessary information commas, parentheses, or colons.
Most commonly on the ACT, 2 dashes function like unnecessary information commas or
parentheses to separate unnecessary information in the middle of a sentence.
Correct: Residents of Washington D.C. - the capital of the United States - are still trying to get
representation in Congress.

Correct: Glazed donuts - even if they are unhealthy - are my favorite.
Keep an eye out for pairs of dashes setting apart unnecessary information. A pair of dashes sets apart
unnecessary information in the same way that a pair of commas does. It is important to remember that
you cannot mix punctuation! It must be a pair of commas, a pair of dashes, or a pair of parentheses.
Incorrect: Deep-dish pizza - a famous meal in Chicago, does not exist in Italy.
Correct: Deep-dish pizza, a famous meal in Chicago, does not exist in Italy.
Correct: Deep-dish pizza - a famous meal in Chicago - does not exist in Italy.
Correct: Deep-dish pizza (a famous meal in Chicago) does not exist in Italy.
On more difficult questions, a single dash can act as a colon introducinga list of multiple items, a list
of one item, an example, an explanation, a definition, or a clarification. When acting as a colon, a dash
must follow the same 3 colon rules we just covered on page 30.
Correct: You will need the following ingredients - milk, butter, flour, and eggs.
Correct: In order to establish his dominance, the male lion relied on one thing - his thunderous roar.
Correct: The study declared that the results were conclusive - mice will complete the maze faster if
they are given soda instead of water.

Challenge - Single Dash Acting Like Parentheses
A single dash in the middle of the sentence can also separate information at the end of the sentence just
like a pair of parentheses would.
Correct: After three weeks, the patient was fed up with his doctor’s plan (or lack of a plan).
Correct: After three weeks, the patient was fed up with his doctor’s plan - or lack of a plan.
This rule has been very rarely tested on the ACT English Test in the past, but it may start to appear on
future ACTs more often.

Apostrophes
Apostrophes on the ACT have two functions: possession and contractions.

Possession Rules
Apostrophes are most commonly used to show possession. For singular nouns, add an apostrophe

and the letter “s” to the end of the word to show possession.
Correct: Terrence’s bike is much faster than my brother’s roller blades.

For singular words that end in the letter “s,” such as “bus,” we can add an apostrophe and the letter “s”
or just add an apostrophe. Both are technically correct. The ACT has not tested this specific rule yet, but
it is good to know just in case.
Correct: The bus’s driver asKed us to sit down.
Correct: The bus’ driver asked us to sit down.

For plural nouns that end in “s,” add the apostrophe after the “s” to show possession.
Correct: The boys’ jerseys were all covered in mud after the game.

Some plural nouns do not end in the letter “s.” For these, add an apostrophe and the letter “s” to the end
of the word to show possession.
Correct: Our women’s basketball team won the championship last year.

TIP - Possessive vs. Plural
The ACT asks you to pick between singular possessive, plural possessive, and non-possessive, plural
words. The challenge is that the words sound very similar, as you can see here:
Correct: | accidentally stepped on the dog’s bone.

(singular possessive)

Correct: The dogs’ collars are in the basket by the door. (plural possessive)
Correct: | watched as the dogs played in the yard.

(non-possessive plural)

Before adding an apostrophe, make sure the next word is actually being possessed by the noun. In the
first example, the dog is possessing the bone. In the second example, the dogs are possessing the collars.
In the third example, the dogs are not possessing the played, so there is no possession.

Apostrophes Practice:
1.

The (witch’s/witches’/witches) magic broom allowed her to fly.

2.

Mary had three children, and all of the (kid’s/ kids’/kids) heights were marked on the garage door.

3.

The earthquake knocked all the (door’s/doors’/doors) off their hinges.

4.

The lawyer demanded that his (client’s/clients’/clients) testimony be removed from the record.

5

It should be illegal to steal (eagle’s/eagles’/eagles) eggs from their nests.

PrepPros ACT English Course

Possessive Pronouns
Possessive pronouns (his, hers, its, theirs, ours, yours) end in an “s” and do not use an
apostrophe to show possession. The difficulty is that words like “yours” and “ours” may look like they
may need an apostrophe.
The correct and incorrect versions of possessive pronouns are shown below:
Correct

Its

Incorrect

It’s

Its’

Hers

Her’s

Hers’

Yours

Your's

Yours’

Ours

Our’s

Ours’

Theirs

Their’s

Theirs’

Contractions
For a contraction, add an apostrophe. For example, “it’s” is a contraction for “itis” and “they're” is a
contraction for “they are.”

TIP - Possessive Pronouns vs. Contractions
If you need to pick between a conjunction and a possessive pronoun, plug in the complete phrase and
see if it works.

The cat loves playing with (its/it’s) newtoy.
The cat loves playing with itis new toy.

(plugin “it is”)

(well that is wrong)

So the answer is:
Correct: The cat loves playing with its new toy.

Let’s practice with the most commonly featured contractions on the ACT:

“its” (possessive) vs. “it’s” (it is)
I cannot believe that (its/it’s) not butter!
The dog keeps chasing (its/it’s) tail.

“your” (possessive) vs. “you're” (you are)
Please keep (your/you’re) feelings to yourself.
(Your/you're) not going to believe what happened on Game of Thrones!

“their” (possessive) vs. “they're” (they are)
The gold medal winners all held up (their/they’re) medals for the picture.
(Their/They’re) going to the opera despite the bad reviews.

“whose” (possessive) vs. “who's” (who is)
I do not know (whose/who’s) socks these are.
Honestly, (whose/who’s) going to pay fifteen dollars for a burrito?

Quotation Marks
Quotation marks are most commonly used for direct quotes.
Direct quotes that are spoken are offset by a comma. Anytime the quote is actually being spoken in
some way (said, yelled, whispered, exclaimed, etc.), there is a comma before or after the quotation.

Correct: Abigail said, “I will not pay until the painting is completed.”
Correct: “The thunderstorm last night woke me up,” Paul whispered.
Direct quotes that are not spoken have no commas. If the quote is not being spoken and is just a
phrase or part of the sentence, there is no punctuation.

Incorrect: My grandfather described the shells as, “beautiful souvenirs from a past life.”
Correct: My grandfather described the shells as “beautiful souvenirs from a past life.”
Here, the quotation marks show “beautiful souvenirs from a past life” are the grandfather’s words and
not the writer’s words. Since the words are not actually being spoken by the grandfather, there is no
comma before the quotation marks.
Quotation marks can be used to show a word is being used as a technical term, used in an
unusual or slang way, or used as another expression that varies from standard usage.

Correct: Having defined the term “contact variance,” Dr. Chen continued his lecture.
Correct: Sven refers to himself as a “professional” influencer.
Correct: This “revolutionary” program has left thousands of children without a basic education.
Correct: Allie could smell the “fresh” fish from across the room.

Chapter 4: Verbs
Verbs questions test you on two major topics - subject-verb agreement and verb tense. The subject-

verb agreement questions are trickier, as at times it can be difficult to find the subject and “hear” which
verb is correct. You will learn a few methods in this chapter to correctly answer these questions. For
the verb tense questions, the approach is much more straightforward: read for context and go with the
answer that sounds correct.

Subject-Verb Agreement
Whenever you see a verbs question on the ACT, your first job is to find the subject. The subject, which
is the person, place, or thing doing the action, is usually at the beginning of the sentence.
The subject of the sentence must agree with the verb. If the subject is singular, the verb must be
singular, and if the subject is plural, the verb must be plural. In simple sentences when the subject and
verbs are right next to each other, it will be easy to select the right verb:
Cats (loves/love) to sit in empty boxes.
My dog (barks/bark) at the mailman every day.
Easy right? Unfortunately, verbs questions will not be this easy on test day. The ACT increases the
difficulty by putting distance between the subject and the verb. The farther away the subject is from the
verb, the more likely we are to say the verb incorrectly. Remember, what sounds right is not always
right. You cannot trust your ear on subject-verb agreement questions.
There are 3 ways the ACT will try to trick you on subject-verb agreement:
1.

Unnecessary information phrases between the subject and verb.

Unnecessary information phrases never contain the subject. Cross out any unnecessary
information phrases to find the subject.
Tortoises, known to live to over 150 years old, (is/are) sold at the local pet shop.
The committee, composed of two former CEOs, one politician, three lawyers, and two doctors,
(vote/votes) to delay the release of the new product until next quarter.
2.

Prepositional phrases between the subject and verb (most common).

Prepositional phrases never contain the subject or the verb. Cross out prepositional phrases to
find the subject.
The entire group of students (is/are) organizing a bake sale to raise money.
The pod of dolphins (hunts/hunt) as a team.
3.

Group nouns that sound plural but are singular.

Group nouns (class, committee, team) are singular even though the group consists of more than one
person/thing.
The sheep herd (waits/wait) to be sheared.
The jury (agrees/agree) that the defendant deserves to be put in jail.

TIP - Read the Subject and Verbs Side-by-side
Once you find the subject and verb, read them next to each other and ignore the information in between.
This will help you more easily identify which one is correct.
A large percentage of the voters, many of whom are under the age of 30, (prefer/prefers) the new
housing proposal.
Cross out any unnecessary information and prepositional phrases.
A large percentage efthe voters, manyehyhem
are under the age of 30, (prefer/prefers) the new
housing proposal.

The subject is “percentage.” Put the subject and verb next to each other and ignore the rest of the
sentence.

Correct: A percentage prefers the new housing proposal.
Practice:

1. The entire class of first graders (cheer/cheers) when the ice cream truck arrives.
2. The proposal for planting a new grove of orange trees (requires/require) an approval of 80% to
pass.

3. With the budget finally approved, the new system for payroll, scheduling, and human resources that
took three years to build (is/are) finally going live next month.

TIP - Plug in “he/she/it” for singular subject and “they” for plural subjects
Sometimes it is difficult to “hear” which verb correctly matches with the subject. For singular words,
plug in “he,” “she,” or “it” for the subject. For plural words, plug in “they” for the subject. With this trick,
we will be able to easily hear which verb properly agrees with the subject.
The exact time for the meeting with the softball coach and location for the showcase
(has/have) not been finalized.
If we read the sentence as is, it is difficult to tell which verb fits. After crossing out the prepositional
phrases, the sentence looks like this:
The exact time forthe meeting seftball
with the
eeach and location fertheshewease
(has/have) not been finalized.

The subjects are “time” and “location,” so the subject is plural. Replace the subjects with “they.”
They (has/have) not been finalized.

Now it’s easy...we can tell that “have” is correct.

Try this tip with the examples below:
1.
2.

Each of the runners who complete the marathon (wins/win) a medal.
The complex designs and intricate needlework (makes/make) Julia’s carpets the most popular in

Verb Tense
For questions on verb tense, trust your ear. As a native English speaker, you will know what sounds
right or wrong in the sentence as long as you read for context. To find which tense is correct, read
the previous sentence(s) and look for other verbs. Make sure to match the tense in the rest of the
paragraph.
On the ACT, do not pick a complicated tense (has run, had ran, had been running, would have run, etc.)
when a simple tense works.
Last year, Margot (designs/designed/will design) a new line of summer dresses.
Before he votes tomorrow, Dale (researches/research/will research) each candidate’s positions
on the major issues.
The referee stopped the fight after the boxers (refuses/refused /will refuse) to follow the rules.
In English, we use the perfect tense when there are multiple timelines in a sentence. The perfect tense is

when we say “has” or “have” or “had” with the verb. If you read for context and read the entire sentence,
we should be able to “hear” when we need to use the perfect tense.
Many surfers enjoy paddling out, but few (rode/have ridden) waves over ten feet tall.
While the group of entrepreneurs claimed to all be successful, only a few (will start/have
started) their own businesses.
The bison (ate/had been eating) when the lions began their attack.
By the beginning of next year, the doctors (finish/finished/will have finished) their preliminary
research on lung cancer.
The conditional tense describes what would or could happen in the future. The kind of verb conjugation
that we need depends on how likely the outcome is to actually happen (probable, improbable,
impossible). Again, the Key here is to trust your ear and go with what sounds right to you.
If|make the free throw, we (will win/would win/would have won) the game.
IfImade the free throw, we (will win/would win/would have won) the game.
If|had made the free throw, we (will win/would win/would have won) the game.
The ACT also tests you on irregular verbs. For these verbs, just trust your ear and go with what sounds
correct to you.

Before the show (began/begun), the lights were dimmed.
The deliveryman had (rang/rung) the doorbell before dropping off the package.
By the time the meal was over, the boy had (ate/eaten) an entire bag of popcorn and had
(drank/drunk) a liter of cola.

TIP - Irregular Verbs
- “a” vs. “u” versions
aw

ai

ely

For many of the most difficult irregular verbs, there is an “a” version (ex: swam) and a “u” version (ex:
swum). We use these verbs incorrectly all of the time, so using your ear and trying to hear which one
sounds correct is difficult. All you need to do is remember the simple rules below:

With “has,” “have,” or “had” ===> Use the “u” version

(perfect tense)

Correct: Before you arrived, I had swum some laps.

With no “has,” “have,” or “had”

c="

Use the“a” version
