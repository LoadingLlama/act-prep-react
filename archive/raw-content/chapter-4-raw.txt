The ACT loves to ask geometry questions, and you will see them throughout the math test. Most commonly,
you will need to know how to find the area and volume of various shapes or apply the rules for various types
of triangles. However, you will not be given any equations, so you need to memorize all of the equations
and rules that are bolded in this chapter. As long as you have the equations memorized, you will be ready
to solve any geometry questions with shapes.

has a length of 9 inches. A square whose area is equal to the

has a side length of 12 inches. What is the width, in inches, of rectangle ABCD?
C.

16

D.

18

Solution: Since the area of rectangle ABCD and the square are equal, we first find the area of the square.

A =127 = 144
Now, we know the area of rectangle ABCD is 144 square inches and that one side length is 9 inches, so we
can solve for the width using A = lw.
144 = (9)(w)
w = 16
The answer is C.

Example 2: Amanda is freezing ice cream in a circular cake pan to make an ice cream cake. The cake

pan has a diameter of 25 cm. If Amanda uses 2,000 cm? of ice cream to make the ice cream cake, which
of the following is closest to the height, in centimeters, of the ice cream cake?
A.

12

B. 8

C. 6

D. 4

Solution: To solve, we will use the equation for the volume right cylinder. We know the volume is equal to

2,000 cm3. The radius of a circle is equal to half of the diameter, so the radius is equal to 12.5 cm. Now, we
can solve for the height.

V=nrh

2000 = (12.5)2h

m(12.5)2 —

h

4.07 =h
The height is equal to 4.07 cm, which is closest to 4. The answer is D.
Example 3: Morgan is making a poster for her room. Her original poster did not fit on her wall, so she is
changing the dimensions by tripling the width and halving the length. If the original area of the poster was

4A, what is the area of the new poster in terms of A?

A. =A

B. 2A

C. 4A

D. 6A

Solution: Method #1 — The Math Teacher Way: We know the area of the original poster is 4A, so
4A =lw

Now, we just need to see how the area changes with the new length and width:

New Area = (0.51)(3w) = 1.5lw
The new area is 1.5 times as large as the old area. From the first equation, we know that 4A = lw, so plugging
in the 44, we can find the new area in terms of A.

New Area = 1.5(4A) = 6A
The answer is D.

Method #2 — Substitution: If solving this question algebraically seems confusing, well that’s because it is!
To make this question easier, use the substitution we learned in Chapter 2 and pick values for the length and
width of the original poster. Let’s say the length is 2 and the width is 3, so the original poster has an area of 6.
Now, use the numbers we picked to solve the rest of the question.

New Width = 3(3) =9

New Length = 2(0.5) = 1
New Area = lw = (9)(1) =9
The original area was 6 and the new area is 9. The new area is 1.5 times larger than the original area, so we

can apply that same change to the poster’s original area of 4A.

New Area = 1.5(Original Area) = 1.5(4A) = 6A
The answer is D.

Areas, Volumes, and Units
The ACT loves to ask area or volume questions with various units. The most common are yards and feet or
feet and inches. Students often answer these questions incorrectly because they make mistakes with unit
conversion, even though the math is very simple. For example, let’s consider the following example:
Example 4: A professional soccer field is 136 yards long and 93 yards wide. What is the area of a

professional soccer field in square feet?
A.

113,832

B. 37,944

C.

12,648

OD. 4,216

Solution: The key to solving these questions properly is convert the units BEFORE solving for the area

or volume. For Example 4, we should convert the length and width of the soccer field from yards to feet and
then solve for the area.

1 yard is 3 feet, so we can use that conversion to find the length and width in feet.

Length: 136 yards x 3 = 408 feet

-16-

Width: 93 yards x 3 = 279 feet

Chapter 4: Geometry Part 2 - Shapes

To find the area of the soccer field, we use the area of a rectangle equation and solve.

A = lw = (408 ft)(279 ft) = 113,832 ft?
The answer is A.

You should memorize the unit conversions in bold below:
Yards and Feet

Feet and Inches

1 yard = 3 feet

1 foot = 12 inches

1 square yard = 9 square feet

1 square foot = 144 square inches

1 cubic yard = 27 cubic feet

1 cubic foot = 1,728 cubic inches

The ACT has commonly tested unit conversion questions on recent tests. When solving these questions,
always convert units BEFORE solving for any area or volume. For more advanced questions, knowing the
other conversion above can also be useful. The square yard, square feet, and square inches are used when
finding area while the cubic yard, cubic feet, and cubic inches are for volume.

Volumes of Other Three-Dimensional Solids
We already know how to find the volume of a rectangular prism (a box), a cube, and a right cylinder, but how
do we find the volumes of other three-dimensional solids? The volume of any three-dimensional shape can be
calculating using the equation
V=Bxh

where B is the area of the base and h is the height. This equation is helpful for calculating the volume of a
shape that is not one of the ones that we have already covered or is an odd shape that does not have a simple
volume equation.
Example 5: Ming is building a sculpture out of wood. The base of the sculpture is shown below. If Ming
plans to make the sculpture 7 feet tall, what is the volume, in cubic feet, of the entire sculpture?

Gap,

70

2ft

210

15 ft

280

|
|

Solution: First, we need to find the area of the base, which here is a trapezoid. Using the trapezoid area
formula, we find the area:
1

1

The area of the base is 30 ft?. Now, we can use the volume equation and the height, which is 7 feet, to solve.
V=Bxh= (30)(7) = 210
The answer is C.

Right Triangles

a

All right triangles follow the Pythagorean Theorem:

a* + b* = ¢c*
where a and b are the lengths of the legs and c is the hypotenuse. You can only use the Pythagorean Theorem
equation for right triangles.

Example 6: In the triangle ABC, point D is the midpoint of AB, AC = 12 m, and BC = 15 m. To the
closest meter, what is the length of CD?
A.

B.

D.

9

B

15

D

coi

A

|

C

PD

Solution: To find the length of CD, we need to find the length of AD and use the Pythagorean theorem. To
find AD, we need to first find AB using the Pythagorean theorem.

127 + b* =15? > 144+
5? = 225 > b* =81
b=9
AB = 9. Point D is the midpoint of AB, so we know that AD is half of AB. AD = 4.5. Now that we know

AD, we can use the Pythagorean theorem again to solve for CD.

127+. 4.5% =c* > 1444+ 20.25 = c* > 164.25 = c?
c= 12.82

CD = 12.82, which is closest to 13. The answer is B.

TIP — Pythagorean Triples
Pythagorean triples are sets of whole numbers that work in the Pythagorean theorem. On the ACT, you
should look out for the two common Pythagorean triples.
3, 4, 5 Right Triangle

5, 12, 13 Right Triangle

These triangles can also be scaled up by multiplying all of the side lengths by the same number to create
more Pythagorean triples. For example, a3, 4, 5 nght triangle can be doubled to become a 6, 8, 10 right
triangle, tripled to become 9, 12, 15, and so on.

Special Right Triangles
You will need to be familiar with two special right triangles: 45° — 45° — 90° and 30° — 60° — 90°. The side
lengths of these triangles are always in a particular ratio.

Se

30°

0

Solution: This is a 30° — 60° — 90° right triangle, so we just need to use the ratio of side lengths to solve.

The shortest side, x, is always half the length of the hypotenuse, y. We know that y = 10, so x = = (10) = 5.
The answer is B.

Example 8: Triangle ABC below is a right isosceles triangle. What is the area of triangle ABC?

Solution: A right isosceles triangle is the same as a 45° — 45° — 90° right triangle. To find the area of
triangle ABC, we need to know side lengths AB and BC. To find these side lengths, we can use the ratio from
the 45° — 45° — 90° right triangle. We are looking for the legs of the triangle, which are the x ’s, and we are

given that the hypotenuse, which is the x¥2. Since we know the hypotenuse is equal to 16, we can solve for x.

xV2 = 16
16

16

v2

16V2

"V2 V2 V2

= 8V2

We know that AB = BC = 8V2. Now that we know the base and height, we can solve for the area of triangle
ABC.

Area of ABC = = (8V2)(8V2) = = (128) = 64
The answer is C.

lengths are proportional.

For similar triangles, the ratio of the side lengths is always the same:

Example 9: In triangle ABC, DE is parallel to BC, AE = 8, AC = 20, and AB = 18. What is the length
of AD?

Solution: Triangles ADE and ABC are similar triangles. Anytime a line drawn parallel toone of the bases
makes a smaller triangle, the smaller triangle will be similar to the larger triangle. Here, DE creates the
smaller similar triangle. Since the triangles are similar, we know the side lengths must be proportional.

The answer is B.

Backup Method — Educated Guess: Remember that the figures on the ACT are drawn to scale. Even if we
have no idea how to solve this question, we can look at the figure and see that AD is almost the same length as
AE, which is 8. Answer choice A is way too small and answer choices D is way too large. We know the

answer needs to be B or C, so you have a 50:50 chance of guessing this correctly.
This method works almost all the time on figures questions the ACT, especially on the most difficult shapes
questions at the end of the test. Be sure to always look at the answer choices before guessing randomly to
see if you can make an educated guess. On some questions, you can even find the correct answer by just
using the figure and the answer choices.

B. 99

C. 109

D.

111

Solution: Since ABC is an isosceles triangle and BC is the longest side, we know AB = AC. That means we
can find ZB:
ZB = ZC = 35°

Once we know 2B = 35°, we can find ZADB because we know the other two angles in triangle ADB.
ZADB = 180° — 35° — 74° = 71°
The angle x° that we are looking for is adjacent to ZADB, so we can solve:
x° = 180° — 71° = 109°
The answer is C.

Backup Method — Educated Guess: Remember that the figures on the ACT are drawn to scale. If we look at
the figure and the angle, we see it 1s obtuse, so we can eliminate answer choices A, which is too small. From
there, we can estimate the angle and take your best guess between answer choices B, C, and D.

Third Side of a Triangle
Can you make a triangle with side lengths of 4, 5, and 10? What about with side lengths of 4, 5, and 9? Or
with side lengths of 4, 5, and 8? While this may at first seem confusing, there is a simple rule:

The sum of the two shorter sides of a triangle, a and b, must be greater than the longest side of a
triangle, c.

a+b>c

Let’s use this rule to review the three potential triangles introduced above. We will start with a triangle with
side lengths of 4, 5, and 9.
44+5%9

9

Since the sum of the shorter side lengths are equal to the longest side, we cannot make a triangle.
Let’s try side lengths of 4, 5, and 10.
4+5%10

10

The two shorter sides cannot even reach the end of the longest side, so again we cannot make a triangle.
What about side lengths of 4, 5, and 8?
4+5>8

oe
8

Since the sum of the smaller side lengths are greater than the longest side, we can make a triangle!
Example 11: Triangle ABC has two sides of lengths 10 and 15. Which of the following could NOT be

the third side of triangle ABC?
A.

5

B. 8

C.

13

D.

19

Solution: To solve, we just need to test each answer choice to find which one does not work with our third
side of the triangle rule. For answer choices A, B, and C, the longest side would be 15. For answer choice D,
the number in the answer choice would be the longest side.

Let’s start with answer choice A.
5+10%15

The sides of 5 and 10 are equal to 15, so no triangle can be formed.
If we test the rest of the answer choices, we see that each of them works.
For
B:

8+10> 15

ForC: 13+10> 15
For
D: 10+15 > 19
The answer is A.

Other Rules You Might Need to Know
Since there is so much geometry tested on the ACT, there is still more geometry that we will not fully cover in
this book! Below are some additional geometry rules that you may need to know for test day. Any students
aiming for very high math scores should memorize all the rules below.

1.

Side Lengths and Angles in a Triangle

The smallest side in a triangle is opposite from the smallest angle. The largest side in a triangle is
opposite from the largest angle.

2.

3.

Other Triangle Definitions
e

An acute triangle has angles that are all less than 90°.

e

An obtuse triangle has 1 angle that is greater than 90°.

e

A right triangle has 1 angle that is equal to 90°.

Area of an Equilateral Triangle

Find the area of an equilateral triangle with side lengths s with the equation. A = ~

2

Memorize this equation. It can be extremely helpful for advanced triangles questions.

4.

Half of an Equilateral Triangle is a 30° — 60° — 90° right triangle.

Cutting an equilateral triangle in half vertically creates two 30° — 60° — 90° right triangles.

5.

Tangent Lines and Circles

A tangent line to a circle is a straight line that just touches the circle at one point. The angle between the
radius of the circle and the tangent line is always 90°. Two tangent lines to a circle from a single point
are congruent.

!0

6.

Perimeters and Maximizing the Enclosed Area

Given a certain perimeter, a circle always maximizes the enclosed area. If you must make a rectangular

shape (more common in question on the ACT), a square maximizes the enclosed area. For example, if
you have 40 feet of fence to enclose a yard and are not given an answer choice that is a circle, a square with
side lengths of 10 feet gives you the largest possible enclosed area (100 square feet).

7.

Pythagorean Theorem and Types of Triangles

If a* + b* = c’, it is a right triangle.
If a? + b* > c’, it is an acute triangle.
If a? + b* < c’, it is an obtuse triangle.
