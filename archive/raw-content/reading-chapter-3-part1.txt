HUMANITIES: This

passage is adapted from the article
“Winslow Homer: His Melancholy Truth” by John A. Parks
(©2006 by VNU Business Media).

The images in the paintings of Winslow Homer
epitomize a peculiarly American 19th-century world.
Through Homer’s eyes, it is a world in which people
live in close contact with nature and natural forces, a
world where landscape and ocean are viewed not as a
paradise but as powers and presences that can be
enjoyed and whose threats can sometimes be overcome.
And, particularly in his later paintings, it is a world
imbued with a stark and melancholy atmosphere.
In 1867, two of Homer’s canvases were chosen to
hang at the Great Exposition in Paris. The artist spent
10 months in the city, which later proved to have a profound effect on his art. A large display of Japanese
prints was exhibited in the same building as his own
paintings, and the process of simplification that it
revealed and the wealth of pictorial invention it provided made a deep impression on the artist. The influence of Japanese art on Homer’s painting was
immediately apparent upon his return to the United
20 States. The weakness of earlier compositions is
replaced by a boldness and lucidity in which simple
shapes are massed into powerful designs.
Although Homer’s work of the 1870s gained
strength, the artist continued to paint his genre subjects:
25 tourist scenes, schoolchildren, and farm life. It wasn’t
until 1881, however, that he found the subject matter
that would inspire him most. In that year, for reasons
unknown, Homer went to England, where he elected to
spend the summer at the town of Tynemouth on the
30 coast of the North Sea. It is possible that he was searching for a town filled with the type of tourists and
bathers that made his paintings of the Jersey shore successful back home. But Tynemouth was also a community of fishermen who wrested their livelihood from the
35 dangerous and unpredictable waters of the North Sea.
Moreover, the light and weather in that part of the
world, so much farther north than Atlantic City, is
much gloomier and more dramatic than that of the
Jersey coast. It was there that Homer became enthralled
40 by the dramas of the people who make their living from
the ocean: the fishermen’s wives staring out to sea as
they wait for their men, the launch of the lifeboat to
rescue sailors from a foundering ship, the agonizingly
fragile fishing boats being tossed on angry waves. Here
45 at last was a subject matter that matched the artist’s
deepest feelings. The dynamic and dangerous relationship between human activity and natural forces exposed
in this setting would occupy Homer for many years to
come. On his return to America he elected to leave New
50 York and relocate to the rural town of Prouts Neck,
Maine.
The legend of Winslow Homer is that he left New
York civilization to become a recluse on the coast of
Maine for the last 25 years of his life. In reality, the

55 property at Prouts Neck—which included a

large, rambling hotel building—was purchased by his brother
Charles for the whole extended Homer family. The
artist also built a studio with an ocean view just yards
away from the family house so throughout the summers
he could enjoy the company of his father, his brothers
and their wives, as well as the year-round guests of the
many local people whose friendship he valued. Homer
continued to travel frequently, spending parts of the
winter in the Caribbean. But the artist always lived
65 alone, and when he was working, which was the large
part of most of his days, he could be extremely shorttempered when interrupted.
The sea outside his window now inspired the artist
to create what came to be known as his greatest paint70 ings. The Maine coast is extremely rocky and prone to
monstrous gales that—at their most powerful—can
whip up the waves to 40 or 50 feet. Screaming winds
can rip across the breakers, creating long horizontal
trails of spray. Homer rendered this sea with all the
75 understanding of a painter who knows to simplify and
synthesize. In paintings such as Eastern Point and
Cannon Rock the construction of the water has been
reorganized into clear graphic shapes and strong directional lines that echo the Japanese printmaking that had
such a lasting effect on his work. The rocks in the
paintings are massed into powerful, almost flat, designs
and the brushing has become energetic, as though feeding from the physical strength of the ocean. These
paintings take on an abstract grandeur that has justly
85 made them famous. They remain, however, haunting
evocations of the eternal power of the ocean.

Approach #2 — The Big Read with Notes
The second approach is identical to the Big Read except that you write down a quick note after every 10-15
lines or after each paragraph that summarizes what is being discussed.
e

Read the entire passage including the short intro above the passage.

e

Read to understand the passage; do not skim the passage.

e

Read the passage in 2-4 minutes (3-6 minutes for extended time) at a medium pace. Do not speed

read it as fast as you can. Do not read it slowly like it is your favorite book. The best pace for most
students is somewhere in between. The exact time depends on your reading speed and the passage.
e

Write down a note after every 10-15 lines or after each paragraph. The note can be a single word
or a short phrase. Having to write down a note forces you to stay focused on the passage and helps
you more quickly find the correct part of the passage when answering the questions.

e
e

After you read the entire passage, work through the questions.
Skip any broad passage questions (main idea, best summarizes the passage, the passage can be

best described as...) and save them for last. These are commonly the first question in each passage.
After answering the rest of the questions, you will better understand the entire passage, and broad
passage questions will be easier to answer correctly.
e

Go back to the passage and use your notes to find the evidence in the passage that supports the
correct answer for each question.

e

Follow the 30-second Rule. If you cannot find the evidence to answer the question in 30 seconds,
bubble in your best guess, circle the question number, and move on.

e

You do not need to answer the questions in order. The questions on the ACT Reading are not
strictly chronological, so you can skip a question if you have no idea where to look, are having trouble
finding the evidence, or know the question will be better to answer later. We will discuss this skill in
much more depth later in this course.

e

Once you are done answering all 9 questions, check your watch. If you still have time left on the
passage, you can go back to any questions that you circled. If not, go to the next passage.

Approach #3 — Label Then Read
The third approach involves looking at the questions first. However, you are NOT reading all the questions.
Instead, you are looking for any questions that reference a specific line or paragraph and labelling

where those questions are in the passage. Make sure to label where the line is with the question number.
For example, if question 3 says “in lines 30-33,” go put a 3 next to lines 30-33. As you read the passage, you

will know to read closely when you get to the lines for question 3.
Note: This method can be used with either The Big Read or The Big Read with Notes.
e

Skim the questions and look for line references in the questions or specific references to a

paragraph. This skim should only take a maximum of 20-30 seconds. Ifa question says, “in lines
45-46” or “the third paragraph,” we label where those questions are. Do NOT read the entire
question. Only look for line references.

e

Label where the lines for questions are in the passage with the question number. If question 25 is
in lines 45-46, put a 25 next to those lines.

e

Read the passage.

e

As you get to lines that are labelled, there are 2 options:

1)

Read the context carefully and then answer the question. Make sure to always read before
and after the labelled lines to get enough context.

2)

Read the question first and then read the lines carefully. By reading the question first, you
know what you are looking for and can often answer the question more quickly.

e

Ifyou do not have enough context to answer the question from what you have read so far, skip the
question and save it for later.

e

For purpose questions with line references, be careful! Make sure you have read enough context to
answer the question properly. If you do not have enough context, skip the question, and save it for
later.

e

Continue to read the passage, repeating this process for any other labelled lines.

e

After you have read the entire passage, answer questions that you have not answered yet.

e

Save broad passage questions (main idea, best summarizes the passage, the passage can be best

described as...) for last. These are commonly the first question in each passage. After answering the
rest of the questions, you will better understand the entire passage, and broad passage questions will
be easier to answer correctly.

The 2-Sentence Rule
For any question with a line reference or when you find the appropriate keywords, read 2 sentences

before and 2 sentences after. The evidence is most commonly in the 2 sentences before or after the line
reference or the keywords.

SOCIAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the article

“Travels with R.L.S.” by James Campbell (©2000 by The New
York Times Company).

Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-1894) preferred to
circumnavigate civilization, with its increasing reliance
on contraptions, and steer toward the rougher fringes.
He self-consciously turned his back on the Victorian
5 idol, progress. In similar spirit, he chose the past more
often than the present as a setting for fiction. His most
popular novels—Treasure Island, Kidnapped, The
Master of Ballantrae—are set in a semimythical realm,
where the fire of adventure catches on every page.
10 Stevenson loved the sound of clashing swords; he
didn’t want them getting tangled up in telephone wires
overhead.

Stevenson, though, was destined to be a modern
man. He was born into a Scottish family of civil engi15 neers, esteemed for its technological genius. His grandfather, also Robert, was Britain’s greatest builder of
lighthouses, and his graceful towers continue to guide
sailors today. Three of Robert’s sons followed him into
the profession, including Robert Louis Stevenson’s
20 father, Thomas, who made his own mark in the field of
optics—his louvre-boarded screens for the protection of
thermometers are still in use today.
