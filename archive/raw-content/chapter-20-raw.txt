Chapter 20: Repeating Patterns
Any idea what number is the 307th decimal place after the decimal point of 0.34562 or what the units digit of

7193 is? Questions like this appear quite often on the ACT, and they seem almost impossible to solve at first
glance. However, once you learn the trick to solving repeating patterns questions, they are actually easy!

Repeating Decimals
The first and easiest type of repeating patterns question is one with a repeating decimal. Remember, a line
above a decimal shows the decimal repeats over and over again without ending. For example,
0.1234 = 0.1234123412341234 ...

As you will see in the following example, we can use the repeating pattern to find values that occur way later

in the decimal without actually writing it out.
Example 1: What is the 307th place after the decimal point in the repeating decimal 0.34562 ?
A.

2

B. 3

C. 4

D.
5

Solution: The trick to solving repeating decimals questions is using the repeating pattern to our advantage.
To show you how this works, let’s write out the decimal in repeating form.
0.34562 = 0.345623456234562 ...

We want to go to the end of the repeating unit, which here is the 2. Since the pattern repeats every 5 places,
every 5th place after the decimal point will be a 2.
0.34562 = 0.345623456234562 ...

a

ee
= 10th_=—

15th

The 5th place, the 10th place, the 15th place are all 2. As the repeating decimal continues, every digit that is a
multiple of 5 will be a2. 25 places, 50 places, 500 places...all of these will be 2.

We are looking for the 307" place after the decimal point. To find that value, we need to find a multiple of 5
near 307. The closest multiple of 5 is 305, which will be a2. Once we know that the 305th place is a 2, we

can count forward in our sequence.
The 306th digit is a 3, and the 307th digit is a4. The answer is C.

Example 2: What is the 703rd place after the decimal point in the repeating decimal 0.596127 ?
A.

1

B. 5

C. 6

D. 9

Solution: Let’s use the same trick we just learned in Example 1. Here, we have 6 digits repeating. We go to
the end of the repeating unit, which here is a 7.
0.596127 = 0.596127596127 ...

Every number that is a multiple of 6 after the decimal point will be a 7. We are looking for the 703rd place
after the decimal point. To find that value, we need to find a multiple of 6 near 703. The closest multiple is
702, which is

a7. Once we know the 702nd place is a 7, we can count forward in the sequence. The 703rd

term is 5. The answer is B.

Repeating Patters with Powers and the Units Digit
What is the units digit of 7123? This is an example of second and more difficult type of repeating patterns
question. Before we learn how to solve these questions, let’s make sure that you know what the units digit
refers to.

The units digit of a number is the digit in the one’s place. For example, the units digit in 945 is 5, and the
units digit of 10,381 is 1.
Now that we know what the units digit (or one’s place) is, let’s get back to learning how to solve repeating
powers questions that ask about the units digit.

Example 3: What is the units digit of 7/22 ?
A.

1

B. 3

C. 7

D. 9

Solution: If we try to enter this into the calculator, most calculators will either give us an error or will show us
a number in scientific notation. Either way, we cannot see the number in the units digit, so we need to take

another approach.
To solve, we need to identify the repeating pattern as the exponent increases. Take a look at the powers of 7
written below and see if you can spot the pattern.

71 =7

7° = 16,807

77 = 49

7° = 117,649

7? = 243

77 = 823,543

7* = 2,401

7® = 5,764,801

As the powers increase, we see a repeating pattern with the units digit. The units digits above are in the pattern
7,9, 3,1, 7,9, 3, 1...

The units digits repeat in the pattern of 7, 9,3, 1 over and over again as the powers increase. Now that we see

the pattern, we can use the same technique we did with repeating decimals: go to the end of the repeating unit.
7,9, 3,1,7,9,3, 1...

The 4th power and the 8th power have a units digit of 1. As the repeating pattern continues, all powers that are

a multiple of 4 will have a units digit of 1. 71%, 74°, 749° will all have a units digit of 1.

We are looking for 7127, so we need to find out what number is the 122nd term in the pattern. To do this, we
want to see if 122 1s a multiple of 4 and, if it is not, find the closest multiple of 4 near 122.

122 is nota

multiple of 4, and the closest multiple of 4 is 120. This tells us that 72° has a 1 in the units digit.
Counting forward in the pattern, 712+ has a7

in the units digit and 7122 has a 9 in the units digit. The answer

is D.

Example 4: 3% has a9 in the ones place. What digit does 3*+? have in the ones place?
A.

1

B. 3

C. 7

D. 9

Solution: To solve this question, we need to know the repeating pattern in the units digit for the powers of 3.
The pattern with the powers of 3 is shown below:

31 =3

3° = 243

37 =9

3° = 729

33 = 27

3” = 2,187

34*=81

3° = 6,561

As the powers increase, we see a repeating pattern in the units digit. The units above follow the pattern
3,9, 7, 1,3, 9, 7, 1...

The pattern of 3, 9, 7, 1 repeats over and over again as the powers increase.
In this question, 3* has a 9 in the ones place. The easiest method to find out what digit is in the ones place of

3*+3 is to pick a value for x and use the pattern above. Since 3* = 9, we can use x = 2. This works because
the 9 is in the ones place.

Now, we need to find out what 3**? has in the ones place. Since we picked x = 2, 3**? becomes 3°.
3° = 243, so there is a 3 in the ones place. The answer is B.
We could have picked any value of x that made 3% have a 9 in the ones place. Since 3° = 729, we could have
used x = 6 and solved from there. 3%*? becomes 3?. 3? = 19,683, which has a 3 in the ones place. The term
3**3 is telling us to go 3 terms forward in the repeating pattern. If we start at any term that has a 9 in the units
digit and count 3 terms forward, we will always get to a term with a 3 in the units digit.

Commonly Tested Repeating Patterns with Powers and the Units Digit
There are a variety of numbers that have a repeating pattern in the units digit as the power increases. The
most commonly tested repeating patterns with powers repeat every 4 terms. You should memorize the
patterns for the numbers below.

2'=2

2° = 32

31 =3

3° = 243

27=4

2° = 64

37 =

3°
= 729

27=8

27 = 128

33 = 27

3” = 2,187

2* = 16

2° = 256

34*=81

3° = 6,561

71 =7

7° = 16,807

81=8

8° = 32,768

77 =49

7° = 117,649

87 = 64

8° = 262,144

7? = 243

77 = 823,543

8? = 512

8’ = 2,097,152

7* = 2,401

7° = 5,764,801

8* = 4,096

8° = 16,777,216

If you ever see other numbers on the ACT in questions like examples 3 and 4, write out the powers until you
see a repeating pattern. Once you spot the pattern, you can use the same methods we used in these examples to
solve.

Repeating Patterns with Powers of t
The final repeating pattern we need to know is with the powers of i. For those of you who have not learned

about complex numbers yet, this will be covered in Chapter 25. All you need to know for now is that
i =~v-—1. The pattern for the powers of i is shown below.

i=i

Pb =i

=-1

if =-1

i =-i

i? =-i

i*=1

i&=1

As the powers increase, this pattern of i, —1, —i, 1 repeats over and over again every 4 terms. You should
memorize this pattern. Since the pattern is every 4 terms, we will use the same method we just used with

repeating powers.

Example 5: 10i*” — 7 is equal to:
A.

—10i-—7

B.

10i + 7

C. 3i

D. 3

Solution: To solve, we need to find out what i*° is equal to. From the pattern above, we know power of i
follow a repeating pattern. We can go to the end of the repeating unit.
i,—1,—i,1,i,-1,-i,1...

ts

8th

i* and i® are equal to 1. As the repeating pattern continues, all powers that are a multiple of 4 will be equal to
1. it7,i2°, i4° are all equal to 1.
We are looking for i*”, so we need to find out what number is the 47th term in the pattern. To do this, we want
to find the closest multiple of 4 near 47. The closest multiples of 4 near 47 are 44 and 48. This tells us that

i*4 = 1 and i*® = 1.

If we use i** and count forward in the pattern, i*° = i, i*© = —1, and i*” = —i. If we use i*® and count
backwards, we see i*” = —i. Now that we know i*” = —i, we can plug in —i for i*” and solve.
10i47 —7 =10(-i) —7 = —10i —7
The answer is A.

Example 6: If k is a multiple of 4, i***+ equals:
A.

1

B. t

C. -i

D. -1

Solution: The easiest way to solve this question is to pick a value for k. We can pick any multiple of 4. To
make this as simple as possible, let’s pick k = 4.
Next, plug in k = 4 and solve.
jAk+1 —

j44+1 =

jl’

Now, we use the repeating pattern that we used in Example 5 to solve for i+”. All powers that are multiples of
4 are equal to 1, so we want to find a multiple of 4 close to 17. The closest multiple of 4 is 16, so i7® = 1.
Counting forward in the sequence, we find that it? = i. The answer is B.

How to Solve Repeating Patterns Questions
For any repeating patterns question, use the following steps:
1.

Identify the repeating unit. For repeating decimals, this should be easy. For repeating powers, you will
need to have the pattern memorized or write out the powers until you see the pattern repeat.
Find the number of items in the repeating unit. For example, 0.235638 has 6 items. All of the powers
and i examples had 4 items.

Go to the end of the repeating unit. In 0.235638, the end of the repeating unit is the 8. In the powers
patterns, the end of the repeating unit is the 4th term. This is the value of the term we will find in step 4.
Find a multiple of the number of items in the repeating unit (step 2) closest to the target number.

For example, if you want to find the 103rd number after the decimal point in 0.235638, find a multiple of
6 near 103. The closest one is 102. The 102nd term is an 8.

Count forwards or backwards in the repeating pattern to find target term. In 0.235638, the 102nd
term is 8 and the 103rd term is 2.
