Basic Trigonometry
For the easier trigonometry questions on the ACT, just remember SOH-CAH-TOA! The majority of
trigonometry questions that appear in the first half of the ACT Math test you on the basic trigonometry
functions.

If you have not heard of SOH-CAH-TOA, it is an acronym to memorize the sine, cosine, and tangent
functions. SOH stands for Sine equals Opposite over Hypotenuse, CAH stands for Cosine equals Adjacent
over Hypotenuse, and TOA stands for Tangent equals Opposite over Adjacent.

For easy trigonometry questions (usually ones that appear in the first 15 questions), you need to set up the
basic trigonometry functions correctly.
Example 1: What is the value of cos B in the triangle below?

A>

1

Bz

v5

C>

2

Dz

B

:

5V5

Solution: To find cos B, we need to find the side length adjacent to angle B and the hypotenuse. The side

length adjacent to angle B is 5 and the hypotenuse is 5V5, so we set up the cosine equation and simplify.
cosB=

5

2 =

1

The answer is B. The ACT sometimes leaves answer choices with the square root in the denominator.
For other similar questions, we may need to use the Pythagorean theorem to find the third side of a triangle and
then find the sine, cosine, or tangent.
Example 2: What is the value of tan A in the triangle below?

A 4

C V33

C

Solution: To find tan A, we need to know the side lengths opposite angle A and adjacent to angle A. The side
length opposite angle A is 4. The side length adjacent to angle A, side AC, is currently unknown. To solve for
AC, we use the Pythagorean theorem.

4? + AC? = 7?
16 + AC? = 49
AC? = 33

AC
= V33
Now, we can label all sides of triangle ABC and find tan A. The opposite side length is 4, and the adjacent

side length is ¥33 so

The answer is B.

Both examples we have done so far gave us a triangle. What if we see a basic trigonometry question and a
no triangle given? We can draw our own right triangle! Remember that SOH-CAH-TOA only applies to
right triangles.

Example 3: For an angle with a measure of g in a right triangle, sing = = and tang = =, what is the
value of cos q?
6

12

15

Solution: We can drawa right triangle, label one of the acute angles as q, and then use the trigonometry
functions to label the sides.

Pa

Since sing = =, we can first label the opposite side as 9 and the hypotenuse as 15. Since tang = = and the
opposite side is already labelled as 9, we now also label the adjacent sides as 12. As a result, the triangle now
looks like this:
15
‘Oo

Now, we can see that cos g = =. The answer is C.

Other Trigonometry Functions To Know
In addition to the sine, cosine, and tangent, you need to know cosecant, secant, and cotangent. These
trigonometry functions are the reciprocals (1.¢e. flip the fraction) of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions,
respectively. Cosecant is the reciprocal of sine, secant is the reciprocal of cosine, and cotangent is the
reciprocal of tangent.

For the secant, we need to know the hypotenuse and adjacent side lengths. So, we need to use the Pythagorean
theorem to solve for the hypotenuse.

Using Trigonometry to Find Side Lengths in Right Triangles
The second very common type of easy trigonometry question asks us to use trigonometry to solve for an
unknown side of a right triangle. To solve these questions correctly, we need to use SOH-CAH-TOA and then
solve for the unknown side.
Example 5: In the triangle below, which of the following expressions is equal to x?
A.

9sin 67°

B.

9cos 67°

B

x

9

S 9 on 67°
2 9 = 67°

C

67°
A

Solution: The first step is to identify which trigonometric function involves the values we are given and x.
We know angle A, the hypotenuse, and are solving for the opposite, so we use the sine function. We can set up
the sine function and plug in the values we are given.

sind = —2Ppeste_
=, sin67° =~9
hypotenuse
Next, we solve for x by multiplying both sides by 9 and get
x = 9sin67°

The answer is A. If the question asks for the numerical value of x, we can plug 9 sin 67° into the calculator to
find the actual length, which here is 8.28.
When solving trigonometry functions in your calculator, make sure that you have your calculator in the
correct mode. Calculators have 2 modes (degree mode and radian mode). If you are entering an angle
measured in degrees, such as 9 sin 67°, you must use degree mode. If you are entering an angle measured in
radians, you must use radian mode. If you are not familiar with radians, we will learn about them later in this
chapter.

math

Another version of a question testing this concept gives us no angle but tells us the value of the sine, cosine, or
tangent. With no angle, using trigonometry seems confusing at first, but, if we know how to set up
trigonometric functions, we solve with the same SOH-CAH-TOA knowledge we used in Example 4.

Example 6: In triangle ABC shown below, cos B = - and the length of AB is 6. What is the length of
AC?

B.

C

D.

Solution: In this question, we are not given any angles, but we are told what the cos B = = We also know that
cosB = = so we can set these equal and solve for BC:
6

2

BC
3
2BC = 18
BC=9

Now that we know BC = 9, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for AC.

AC? +67 = 97

AC? = 45

AC = V45 = 3V5
The answer is C.

Inverse Trigonometric Functions
Inverse trigonometric functions are used to find an unknown angle in a right triangle when the side

lengths are known. Inverse trigonometric functions are just like SOH-CAH-TOA except that the angle is
switched with the side lengths.

In the example triangle, we can use inverse trigonometry to solve for the unknown angle x°. Using a
calculator and any of the inverse trigonometric functions, we can find that angle x = 36.9°. Most questions on
the ACT do not ask you to solve for the actual angle and instead give you answer choices with the inverse
trigonometric functions, so these questions are usually easy to spot on test day.

side and 55 is the hypotenuse, so we need to use the inverse sine functions. Sine is opposite over hypotenuse,

so the correct expression is sinTM+ (=). The answer is D.

Trigonometric Identity To Know
You may not so fondly remember trigonometric identities from math class. Or, if you have never heard of that
term, you will likely dislike them when you learn them in class. The good news is that for the ACT you only

need to know this simple trigonometric identity:

sin*0 + cos*@ = 1
This identity is a rule for all values of 6, which is a term that just represents an angle. You need to memorize

this equation for test day. If you ever see a sin*6 or cos7@ term in a question, you are going to need to use this
identity.

Example 8: If 3sin?6 + 3cos*6 = a, what is the value of a?
A.

WIR

B1

C3

D6

Solution: To solve, we need to use the trigonometric identity sin?6 + cos*6 = 1. If we factor 3 out from the
left side, we get

3(sin?6 + cos?0) =a

Since sin?6 + cos*6 = 1, we can plug in 1 for sin*®@ + cos?6 and solve for a.
3(1) =a
3=a
The answer is C.

As you can see in this example, we only need to use the identity to solve. When you see a sin?6 or cos*6 term
in a question, do not think of SOH-CAH-TOA. Instead, find how you can use the identity to solve as we did in
Example 7.

Cheat Method — Substitution: We can also solve this question by picking a value and using a calculator. We

can pick any value for 6, plug it into equation 3sin*6 + 3cos?6, and see what you get for a. As long as you
enter the equation into your calculator correctly, you will always get 3. Go ahead and try it! If you need to
review Substitution, go to Chapter 2.

Graphing Cosine and Sine Functions
Cosine and sine are periodic functions, meaning that the functions repeat over and over again. To start, you
need to know the basics of what a sine and cosine function look like when graphed. If you have never learned
sine and cosine functions, memorize the basics about each function listed below. This will help you solve
most questions on this topic on test day.
To start, let’s learn what the simplest form of cosine and sine functions look like and learn some general
characteristics.

and the maximum value is at (27, 1).

minimum and maximum in both directions over and over

again.

Sine functions repeat infinitely in both directions.

Notice that the x-axis labels are not numbers — instead, the labels are in radians. If you have never learned
radians, do not focus too much on this, as you only need to understand the basics for the ACT. Radians are
just another way to measure an angle. The conversion is 7 radians = 180 degrees. Trigonometric functions
are most commonly graphed with radians on the x-axis.
*Note that the “basics to know” listed above only apply are for sine and cosine functions where only the
amplitude and period (more on those shortly) are changed. Horizontal shifts can change the start and end
points of the functions. The good news for anyone just learning how to graph sine and cosine for the first time
in this book is that horizonal shifts are not commonly tested on the ACT.

Now that we know the basics, let’s learn two more important characteristics of these functions: amplitude and
period.

- 150

Chapter 17: Trigonometry

Amplitude
The amplitude of function is the amount by which the function travels above or below the midline. You

can think of the amplitude as the height of the function.

The amplitude of a function is defined by |A|, where A is the leading coefficient in front of the sine
or cosine func tion.

f(x) = Acos x

f(x) = Asinx

To make this clearer, let’s look the graphs of 2 cosine and 2 sine functions.

f(x) = cosx

f(x) = 4cos x

f(x) = cos x is the same as f(x) = 1cos x, so for the graph on the left, A = 1. The graph goes up 1 unit from
the midpoint to a maximum value of y = 1 and down 1 unit to the minimum value of y = —1. In the graph on
the right, A = 4, so the graph goes up 4 units to a maximum value at y = 4 and down 4 units to a minimum
value of y = —4.

f(x) = sin x is the same as f (x) = 1sin x, so for the graph on the left,

A = 1. We see the graph going up 1

unit from the midline to a maximum value of y = 1 and down 1 unit to a minimum value of y = —1. For the
graph on the right,

A = 2, so the graph goes up 2 units to a maximum value at y = 2 and down 2 units to a

minimum value at y = —2.

Now that you know the rules for amplitude and the basic shapes of sine and cosine functions, any amplitude
question on the ACT should be easy!

Solution: The graph goes up and down 5 units from the midline, so the amplitude is 5. The answer is D. It is
also important to note that amplitude can never be a negative number, so we know answer choices A and B are
incorrect immediately.

Period
The period of a function is equal to the length of one complete cycle of the function. For the sine and
cosine functions, the period is equal to the length of one full wave, which can be found by finding the distance
between the peaks of the function.

Period = 27

Period = 27

As shown above, the period of a basic cosine and sine function 1s 277. So, what causes the period of a function
to change?

The period of a function is defined by =|, where B is the constant that x is multiplied by in the
function.

f(x) = Acos(Bx)

f(x) = Asin(Bx)

Let’s see how this works.

For the cosine function f(x) = cos x, B = 1, so the period is equal to ea = 2m. For the sine function
f(x) = sin x, B = 1, so the period is equal to =| = 2m These match the periods we see in the graphs above.

- 152
-

Chapter 17: Trigonometry

Now, what happens if we have f(x) = cos 2x. Well here B = 2, so the period is equal to ea =. Let’s look
at the graph of this function.

f(x) = cos 2x

Period = 7

Notice how the repeating units of the function now repeat faster. Changing the B-value in cosine and sine
functions changes the period, which can either squeeze together the function or stretch it out.
Example 10: Which of the following equations properly describes the function f(x) shown below?

A. f(x) =3sin (=)
B.

f(x) = 6cos(4x)

C. f(x) = 3cos (=)
D.

/0

ro

f(x) = 3cos(4x)

Solution: To start, we can see that this is a cosine function because the function is at a maximum value when
x = 0 (and there is no horizontal shift... more on this in the next section), so we know that A is incorrect. We

can also see that the amplitude is 3, so we can eliminate B.
To determine if the correct answer is C or D, we need to find the period. Looking at the graph, we see that the
period is 477. Remember, the easiest way to find the period from a graph is to look for the distance between
the peaks of the function. In the graph, we see peaks of the function at x = 0 and x = 47, so the period is 47.
To find which answer choice is correct, we can use the B-values from the answer choices to see which one
gives us the correct period of 47:

For f@) =3 cos(4x), B=4 , 90

Vertical and Horizontal Shifts
Trigonometric functions follow the same vertical and horizontal shifting rules that we use for all other types of

functions (you can learn more about these in Chapter 33). We will cover the basics for cosine and sine
functions in this chapter. Advanced sine and cosine graphing questions can include vertical or horizonal shifts.

Vertical Shifts
A constant added or subtracted to a sine or cosine function causes a vertical shift. Using the equations
below, the D-value shows the vertical shift of a function.
The vertical shift of a function occurs when a constant, D, is added to or subtracted from the function.

f(x) = Asin(Bx) + D

f(x) = Acos(Bx) + D
To see how this works, consider the two functions below.

f(x) =cosx

57

f(x) =cosx+3

57 1/2

41

r

12

41

Vertical Shift Up 3 Units

Notice how the cosine function is shifted 3 units up on the graph on the night. A positive value of D, such as
3 in the example above, shifts the function up. A negative value of D shifts the function down.

Example 11: When f(x) = 2 sin(x) + C is graphed, the function has no x-intercepts. If C is a positive
constant, which of the following statements about C must be true?
A.

C=2

B.

C<2

C.

C>2

D.

C22

Solution: The best way to solve this question is to draw it out. If you need help drawing it out, you can
reference the graph of f(x) = 2sin(x) on page 151. The amplitude of f(x) is 2, so the minimum value of the
function isa y = —2.

To have no x-intercepts, we must shift the function up by more than 2 units, so the answer is C. If we shift

f(x) up exactly 2 units, the minimum points will be on the x-axis, so there will still be x-intercepts. If we
shift f(x) up by less than 2 units, there will be even more multiple x-intercepts.
This is a more advanced question that would appear at the end of the ACT, so do not worry too much if this
seems challenging...it is supposed to!

-154-

Chapter 17: Trigonometry

Horizontal Shifts
A constant added to or subtracted from the x-value inside the parentheses causes a horizonal shift to the

sine and cosine functions. Using the equations below, the C-value shows the horizontal shift of a function.
The horizontal shift of a function occurs when a constant, C, is added or subtracted to the function.

f(x) = Acos(Bx + C)

f(x) = Asin(Bx + C)

For horizontal shifting, you need to memorize the following rules:

1. The horizontal shift is equal to , When B = 1 (most common on the ACT), the horizonal shift
is equal to C.
2.

A positive value of C shifts the function to the left.

3.

A negative value of C shifts the function to the right.

Now, we know that seems confusing, so let’s see how this works with the functions below.

through the origin (as seen with the

\

dashed line here)

Horizontal shifts are the least common type of transformation with sine and cosine functions on the ACT.

Summary of Transformation Rules for Sine and Cosine Functions
All the transformation rules we have covered in this chapter are summarized below:

y = Acos(Bx+C)+D
e

y = Asin(Bx+C)+D

|A| is the amplitude of the function (half of the total height of the graph).

e The period of the function for sine, cosine, secant, and cosecant is equal to |. For tangent

and cotangent graphs, the period is equal to El.
e

C shifts the graph horizontally. A positive value of C shifts the graph left, and a negative value of

C shifts the graph to the right. The magnitude of the shift is equal to <,
e

D shifts the graph vertically. A positive value of D shifts the graph up, and a negative value of D

shifts the graph down. The magnitude of the shift is equal to D.

Graphing Tangent Functions
Tangent functions are very rarely tested on the ACT, but they have appeared on the test before and will appear
again. You should only study this if you feel confident on the other trigonometry topics or are aiming for
a top ACT Math score.
Tangent functions look quite different from the sine and cosine functions we just learned, but if you know

what a tangent function generally looks like, you should be able to answer any tangent graphing questions
correctly on test day.

Tangent functions repeat infinitely in both directions.

*Note that the “basics to know” listed above are for y = tan x. Horizontal and vertical shifts can change
the characteristics of a tangent function.

Period of Tangent Functions

The period of a tangent function is defined by EI, where B is the constant that x is multiplied by in the
function.

f(x) = tan(Bx)
Using the graph above, notice that the period is equal to 7. The easiest way to find the period of a tangent
function is to find the distance between the vertical asymptotes.

Transformations of Tangent Functions
Tangent functions follow the same rules as sine and cosine functions for vertical and horizontal shifting

that we summarized on the previous page.
That covers pretty much everything you need to know for tangent graphs on the ACT! If you know the basics
of what a tangent graph looks like, how to find the period of a tangent function, and the rules for vertical and
horizontal shifting, you should be able to solve a tangent graphing question if it appears on your ACT.

Solution: To solve, we need to find (1) the vertical shift and (2) the period.
The vertical shift is the easier part, so we will start with that. A tangent function normally intersects the origin,

but we see the tangent function passing through the point (0,—1). Therefore, we know the function is shifted
down 1 unit, so we must see —1 as the D-value. We can eliminate C because the vertical shift is incorrect.
To find the period of a tangent function, we find the distance between two vertical asymptotes. We see two

vertical asymptotes at x = —7 and x = 7 so we know the period of the function is >
Now that we know the period, we need to use the B-values in the answer choices to find which one has a

Questions like this have only appeared at the end of ACTs as part of the hard questions from 45-60 and are not
common. If you are preparing for test day in a more of a rush, graphing tangents is not an important topic to

prioritize.

For students who are aiming for top scores, make sure you understand how to solve a question like this, as it is
not too technically hard if you understand the basics.

Advanced Trigonometry
The ACT LOVES to test you on two advanced trigonometry rules: Law of Sines and Law of Cosines. Many
of you will have never learned these before, so we will teach you everything you need to know in this chapter.
These two topics are very common on the ACT, so you need to memorize both the law of sines and law
of cosines equations for test day.

Law of Sines
The Law of Sines rules written below is true for any type of triangle. It is important to note that Law of
Sines can be used for non-right triangles.

sin(A) sin(B) _ sin (C)

a

ob

¢
a

The Law of Sines is a property for any triangle. For Law of Sines (and Law of Cosines), we no longer use

SOH-CAH-TOA. So, for the sines in the equation above, do not think opposite over hypotenuse. Instead,
remember that an expression such as sin(20°) has a numerical value, so we treat it as a number.
Law of Sines can also be written as:

a

b

c

sin(A) sin(B) sin(C)
This equation is the same as the one above — everything is just flipped. You can memorize and use either
equation. Both are equally effective. You need to memorize the equation because the ACT does not always
give it to you on the test.
We use the Law of Sines to solve for an unknown side or angle in a triangle.
Example 13: Which of the following correctly solve for the value of x in the triangle below?

A.
B

C.
D

850sin(28°)
sin (110°)

7.90

110°

850sin (28°)

x

850

tan (110°)

850

850sin (28°)
sin (110°)

Solution: When solving Law of Sines questions, we want to look for pairs of angles and opposite side lengths.
Here, we have two pairs: 110° and 850 and 28° and x. To solve, we set up the Law of Sines equation.
sin(110°)

—sin(28°)

850.

x

Now, we solve for x. To do so, we first cross-multiply and then divide by sin(110°).

x sin(110°) = 850 sin(28°)
_ 850 sin(28°)

~~

sin(110°)

The answer is D.

Chapter 17: Trigonometry

*Note: For Law of Sines questions on the ACT, the answer choices usually give away that you need to
use Law of Sines. If you ever see answer choices like the ones in Example 12, you are looking at a Law of
Sines question. Most questions do not ask you to solve for a numerical value. Usually, you are asked to find
which expression in the answer choices correctly solves for the unknown as we did in the example above.
That first example was a simpler example, as we were asked to solve for a side length. What if we were asked
to solve for an angle instead?
Example 14: In the triangle shown below, which of the following expressions correctly solves for k ?
A.

sin72 ( 125 sin(86°) )

sin-1(92 sin(86°) — 125)

°

99

D. sin“? (=)

125

92

Solution: We have two pairs of sides and angles to use in the Law of Sines equation: k° and 92 and 86° and
125. To solve, we start by setting up the Law of Sines equation.
sin(k°) _ sin(86°)
92

125

We want to solve for k, so first we need to multiply both sides by 92.
oa(k°) = 92sin(86°)
sin(k°) =
125
Ok, now for the fun (hard) part! We know what sin(k°) is equal to, so to solve for k we need to use the
inverse sine function. If you need to review inverse functions, we covered them on page 148.

92 sin(86°)
k = sin (a
onl

The answer is B. Now if you are thinking, woah, that was hard! Yes, it absolutely was. Questions like this
are often some that students find most difficult on the ACT. A question like Example 13 would be one that is
meant to challenge the best math students. If you have never done any of this advanced trigonometry before
and find this extremely difficult, you can always skip these questions on test day and save them for last.

Law of Cosines
As with the Law of Sines rules we just learned, the Law of Cosines is a property of any triangle. Law of
Cosines is used to find a missing side or angle in a non-right triangle. The Law of Cosines equation is
show below:

a* = b* + c* — 2be cos(A)

a

c
A

b

We use Law of Cosines when we do not have two pairs of angles and opposite side lengths. It is important to
notice that the a-value in the equation is the side length opposite the angle A. The other two side lengths, b
and c, are interchangeable since they do the same thing in the equation.
On the ACT, you are not always given the Law of Cosines, so you need to memorize the equation. The
ACT sometimes includes the equation in a note below the question, but it is not always provided.
You need to know how to set up the Law of Cosines correctly. Depending on the difficult of the question, you
may need to perform additional algebra to solve for the unknown value, as we did in the Law of Sines
examples.
Example 15: Three dancers, Alex, Bialy, and Charlie, are standing on stage at the points shown by the

comers of the triangle below. Alex is standing 35 feet from Bialy, 31 feet from Charlie, and the angle
formed where Alex is standing has a measure of 28°. Which of the following equations solves for the
distance, in feet, between Bialy and Charlie?
A.

Alex

ssh

2(35)(31)cos (28°)

in

31

Solution: For this question, we must use Law of Cosines. The triangle is not a right triangle, so we cannot
use normal SOH-CAH-TOA. We are not provided two pairs of angles and opposite side lengths, so we cannot
use Law of Sines.
The side length we are solving for is opposite the angle that we are given, so the length between Bialy and
Charlie is the a-value. 35 and 31 are b and c. Plugging these values into the Law of Cosines equation, we get:

a* = 357 + 31? — 2(35)(31) cos 28°
To solve for a, we take the square root of both sides.

a = 352 + 312 — 2(35)(31) cos 28°
The answer is C.

*Note: For Law of Cosines questions on the ACT, the answer choices usually give away that you need to
use Law of Cosines. If you see any complicated looking answer choices with cosines, like C and D in
Example 14, you are looking at a Law of Cosines question.

Unit Circle
Remember the unit circle? The one your math teacher made you memorize all of those points for? Well, it’s
back. However, the unit circle is NOT a commonly tested topic on the ACT (and the least commonly
tested trigonometry topic). You should only study this if you feel confident on the other trigonometry
topics or are aiming for a top ACT Math score.

You do not need to memorize all the points but should know the basics of the unit circle for the ACT. For
students aiming for top math scores, we recommend memorizing the entire unit circle.
A complete unit circle is shown below.

(0, 1)

7

Angles on the unit circle can be expressed in degrees or radians. Just as we can describe the temperature in
Fahrenheit or Celsius, we can describe an angle in degree or radians. If you have not worked with radians
before, all you need to know is that 7 radians = 180 degrees. It is important to memorize this conversion for
test day. We will cover radians vs. degrees at the end of this chapter in more depth.
There are a few important principles to know with the unit circle.
1.

The cosine of any angle on the unit circle is equal to the x-coordinate of the corresponding point.

For example, cos(60°) = 2.

The sine of any angle on the unit circle is equal to the y-coordinate of the corresponding point.

For example, sin(60°) = 4
3.

The tangent of any angle on the unit circle is equal to

y—coordinate
x—coordinate
