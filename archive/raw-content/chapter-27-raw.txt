Chapter 27: Inequalities
In math, two values are not always equal. Sometimes, we just know that one value is bigger or smaller when
compared to another value. In these situations, we use inequalities.

Algebra with Inequalities
To solve inequalities on the ACT, treat the inequality signs (<,>,<, =) like an = sign and solve using
algebra. Inequalities can be solved as normal algebraic expressions with the exception of one very important
rule:
When multiplying or dividing by a negative number, switch the direction of the inequality sign.

This rule is the most important thing to remember from this section and where students most commonly make

mistakes on inequalities questions. As a quick example, let’s see how to solve the equation below.
—2x+5<11
—2x <6

When dividing by —2, we switch the direction inequality sign, so
x>-3

Let’s see a second example:
3x+6>x—4

The first step is combining like terms. We subtract x from both sides to get the x-terms on the left side. We

then subtract 6 from both sides to get the numbers on the right side.
3x—x>--4-6
2x >-10

x>-5
In this example, we never multiply or divide by a negative number, so the inequality sign stays the same. Just

because we are working with a negative number does not mean we need to flip the inequality sign. Some
students flip the sign whenever they divide and see a negative sign. Don’t make that mistake! Only flip the
inequality when you multiply or divide both sides by a negative number.
Example 1: Which of the following inequalities describes the solution set for 6x
29

A. x2 >

Boxs

29

>

5

C.xs-7

+12 < 9x +17?

5

D.x2-7

Solution: To solve, we need to isolate x. Here, let’s move all the x-terms to the left side and all the numbers
to the right side. To do this, we subtract 9x from both sides and 12 from both sides to get
6x —9x < 17-12

—3x<5

Now we divide both sides by —3. Since we are dividing by a negative number, we switch the direction of the
inequality sign.
5

x2-3

The answer is D.

Solution: Now is a good time to review how to draw inequalities on a number line.
1.

For greater than and less than (> and <), use an open circle.

2.

For greater than or equal to and less than or equal to (= and <), use solid circles.

For this question, we need to solve the inequality. Let’s move all the x-terms to the left side and all the
numbers to the right side. To do this, we add x to both sides and add 4 to both sides to get
2x+x>6+4
3x
> 10

Now, we divide both sides by 3. Since we are dividing by a positive number, the inequality sign does not
change. We get
10

x2
3

Since the inequality sign is greater than or equal to, we put a solid dot a = and shade to the right of =. The
answer is C.

Graphing Linear Inequalities
When graphing linear inequalities in the coordinate plane, you need to remember three simple steps:

1.

Rearrange the equation into y = mx + b form.

2.

Plot the line. For greater than and less than (> and <), draw a dashed line. For greater than or
equal to and less than or equal to (= and <), drawa solid line.

3.

Shade to show the solution. For greater than and greater than or equal to (> and =), shade
above the line. For less than and less than or equal to (< and <), shade below the line.

Let’s start by graphing the inequality 2x + 3y = 6.
First, we need to rearrange this into slope-intercept form to isolate y. If we do this correctly, we will get

y2-sxt2

- 253
-

math

Since this is greater than or equal to, we drawa solid line and shade above the line, so the graph looks like

The solution set is the shaded area of the graph.
For a system of inequalities in the coordinate plane, the solution is where the shaded regions overlap. For
example, let’s consider the system of inequalities 4x — 2y > 8 and x + 3y > —2.
To graph these inequalities, we need to rearrange them into slope-intercept form to isolate y. If we do this
correctly, we get

y<2x—-—4

and

y>-sx--

2

For the y < 2x — 4 line, we draw a dashed line and shade below the line. For the y > —=x — = line, we draw
a dashed line and shade above the line.

The solution set to this system of equations is the dark area in the top right where the shaded regions overlap.

flatter line has a slope of - and a y-intercept at 2. The shaded region is below the line and the line is dashed, so

the second equation is y < =x +2. The answer is C.
Advanced Graphing Inequalities
On more difficult questions, the ACT will ask you how to graph inequalities with parabolas, circles, and even
ellipses. All these graphs still follow the same rules we just discussed for the solid lines vs. dashed lines.
Students most commonly get confused about where to shade for these inequalities.

Parabolas
Parabolas shade just like lines do. For greater than and greater than or equal to (> and =), shade above
the line. For less than and less than or equal to (< and <), shade below the line. To see how this works,
take a look at the examples below.

Circles and Ellipses
For inequalities with circles and ellipses, remember the following rule: for greater than and greater than or

equal to (> and =), shade outside of the circle or ellipse. For less than and less than or equal to (<
and <), shade inside the circle or ellipse.

Circles

(y-1)?

Ellipses

(x-2)* | (y-1)?

As long as you know how to shade all of these various lines and shapes, you will be ready for the most
difficult inequalities questions that appear towards the end of the ACT math section. In addition to shading,
you also need to know how to properly draw circles, and ellipses to answer these questions correctly. If you
need to learn or review how to graph circles and ellipses, go to chapter 21.

Example 4: The shaded region in the standard (x, y) coordinate plane below is bounded by a parabola
and a line. The shaded region and its boundary is the solution set to which of the following systems of
inequalities?
A.

\
\

y<—2x4+2

y>x2—-2x-1
B.

y2-2x+2

ys —-2x-2

ye2x?-2x-1

-3

Solution: For any questions like these, look at the answer choices right away. In this question, the equation of
the line must be y = —2x + 2 or y = —2x — 2. The y-intercept is at 2, so we know D

is incorrect. We need

to shade below the line, so the equation for the line must be y < —2x + 2. C is also incorrect.
Notice that the equation of the parabola is the same in all of the answer choices. On questions like this, you do
not need to be able to write the equation of the parabola yourself. You just need to know which inequality sign
to use based on where the solution set is. Here, the solution set is above the parabola, so the inequality sign

must be >. The parabola equation is y > x2 — 2x —1. The answer is A.
Example 5: The shaded region in the graph below represents the solution set to which of the following
systems of inequalities?
A.

x+y? <9

D.

yS-sx-1

|

x*+y?<9

/

Solution: As with the last example, we want to look at the answer choices right away. The solution set is

inside of the circle and the circle is drawn with a dotted line, so the circle equation must be x? + y? < 9. The

shaded region is directly below the line y = — =x — 1, which is a solid line, so the second inequality must be

ys —=x — 1. The answer is D.
The other line y = 3x — 4 does not affect the solution set, so it should not be part of our system of inequalities.
If you ever see a line that is not directly bordered by the shaded region, ignore it! The ACT just puts it there to
confuse you.
