Chapter 28: Exponential Growth and Decay
Any quantity that grows or decays at a fixed rate over time is said to experience exponential growth or

decay. Some examples that you may be familiar with include money in a bank account earning 8% interest
each year or the number of bacteria on a plate doubling every week.
For most questions on the ACT, we use the simpler form of the exponential growth and decay equations shown
below:

Growth:

A=P(1+r)!

Decay:

A=P(i-r)é

P = initial value

A = current value

r = rate of the growth or decay
t = time interval

We use the simple form of the equation above when the time interval is in years, which is most common on the
ACT. At the end of this chapter, we will introduce you to the more complex form just in case it appears on
your ACT.

Exponential Growth
To see how these equations work and appear on a graph, let’s examine the equation for a bank account that has

an initial balance of $100 and an 8% annual interest rate.

A= 100(1 + 0.08)*
A = 100(1.08)¢
The $100 is the initial value, and the 8% is the growth rate. 8% is expressed as 0.08 in decimal form, so we
get a value of 1.08 inside the parentheses. A represents the current value after ¢ time intervals. Since the
amount of money in the bank account is increasing at a non-linear rate over time, we have exponential
growth.

Now, let’s see how this exponential growth equation appears on a graph.

For any exponential growth equation, the graph will have an upward curve like this one. The y-intercept of

the graph shows the initial value, which in this example is $100.
Note that the graph is NOT linear. Even though the growth rate remains constant at 8%, the annual increase

in the amount of money in the account will not be the same. In the first year, the $100 grows by 8%, which is

$8, so the final amount in the account at the end of year 1 is $108. For the second year, the money is growing
at 8% but the starting value is now $108, so the amount of money will increase by 8% of $108, which is $8.64.
This explains why a constant rate of change does NOT lead to a constant amount of change and why
exponential graphs are not linear.

Example 1: Julia estimates that the numbers of bees in a hive increases by 30% every month. If Julia
buys a hive with 50 bees, which of the following properly models Julia’s estimate for how many bees, 5,
will live in the hive in m months?

A.

B=50+30m

B. B=50(0.3)"

C.

B=50m2+30

D. B=50(1.3)TM

Solution: The initial number of bees in the colony is 50, and the growth rate is 30%. Since the growth is 30%
each month and not a fixed numerical value, we have exponential growth and not linear growth. A, which is
linear, and C, which is quadratic, are incorrect. The value in the parentheses must be 1.3 and not 0.3 since the

growth rate is 30%. The 1.3 comes from the (1 + 0.3) in the growth equation. The answer is D.

Exponential Decay
Now let’s consider an example of exponential decay. A new car purchased for $20,000 loses 10% of its value
each year after the purchase date.

A = 20,000(1 — 0.1)°
A = 20,000(0.9)
The $20,000 is the initial value, and the 10% is the rate of decay. 10% can be expressed as 0.1 in decimal
form, so we get a value of 0.9 inside the parentheses. A represents the current value after ¢ time intervals.
Now, let’s see how this exponential decay equation appears on a graph.
“\

|

RS

are

Again, note that the graph is NOT linear. The car continues to lose 10% of its value each year, but the

numerical decrease in the car’s value is not the same every year. Anytime we have an exponential decay
equation, the graph will have a downward curve like this one. The y-intercept of the graph shows the initial

value, which in this example is the purchase price of $20,000.
Example 2: The Santa Barbara Newspaper is losing subscribers at a rate of 12% per year. If the
newspaper currently has 24,000 subscribers, which of the following is closest to the number of subscribers
the newspaper will have in 2 years?
A.

15,360

B. 18,240

C.

18,590

D. 21,120

Solution: The newspaper is losing subscribers at a constant percentage rate, so we can use the exponential
decay equation. The 12% decrease can be expressed as 0.12 and, since we asked to find the number of
subscribers in 2 years, t = 2.

Subscribers = 24,000(1 — 0.12)? = 24,000(0.88)* = 18,585.6
The question says, “closest to,” so we are not going to see the exact value in the answer choices. We need to
pick the answer closest to the value of 18,585.6. The answer is C.

General Exponential Form
Exponential equations can also appear in the general form show below.
y = ab*

where a # 0 and b is a positive number and b # 1. The a and b values are constants. The main points we
need to understand about this general exponential form as listed below:
e

ais the y-intercept and shows the initial value of graph when x = 0.

e

bis the rate of change and shows how much the initial value changes per time interval.

e

xis the time interval.

e

Ifb> 1, the equation shows exponential growth.

e

If0< b <1, the equation shows exponential decay.

To better understand general form, let’s consider two examples with some numbers:
Example 1: A population of 150 endangered Rhinos is doubling every year. Write an equation that

models the size of the population, P(x), in x years.
P(x) = 150(2)*
The initial Rhino population is 150, so a = 150. The population is doubling every year, so the rate of change,
b,is 2. x represents the number of years.
Example 2: After a lake is polluted, the population of fish in the lake follow exponential decay. A

survey finds that one third of the fish in the lake survived after 1 month. If the estimated initial

population of fish in the lake was 12,000, write an equation that models the number of fish, F(x), in
m months.

F(x) = 12,000 (=)

m

The initial population of fish in the lake is 12,000, so a = 12,000. The population is one third of its starting

value after 1 month so b = = m represents the number of months.
Graphing General Exponential Form (Bonus Topic)
The ACT can include questions where you need to know how to graph exponential equations, but these are
rare and you are unlikely to see it on test day. If you understand the 2 examples below, you should be able to

The most important difference to understand is how the general shape of the graph changes when b > 1, where
we see exponential growth, compared to when 0 < b < 1, where we see exponential decay.

Also, note that the y-intercept always appears at the point (0,a). For the graph on the left, a = 1, so the
y-intercept is at (0,1). The equation y = 2* is the same as y = (1)2*, so we do not see the 1 in the equation.
For the graph on the right, a = 2, so the y-intercept is at (0, 2).

Advanced Exponential Growth and Decay Equations (Bonus Topic)
The exponential growth and decay equations that we learned at the beginning of this chapter are the simplified
versions. The ACT very rarely includes questions for which you need to know the compound exponential
growth and decay equations listed below. This topic is rarely tested and advanced, so you should only
worry about this if you are aiming for top ACT Math scores.

Compound Growth:

P = initial value

A=P(1+ - yn

A = current value
r = rate of the growth or decay

Compound Decay:

A=P(1--)"

¢ = time interval

n = number of times compounded per time interval

Compounding growth or decay equations are most commonly used for calculations involving money. We only
need to use these more advanced forms of the equations when the compounding occurs multiple times within
each time interval. I know that seems a bit confusing, so let’s take a look at an example to make it clearer.

Example 3: Rachel puts $2,000 in a savings account that has an annual interest rate of 4% and
compounds every 6 months. Which of the following equations correctly calculates the value of her
investment in 3 years?

A. 2,000(1.04)2

B. 2,000(1.04)®

C. 2,000 (1 +*)

3

D. 2,000 (1 +°)

6

Solution: Anytime an annual growth or decay rate is provided and the compounding occurs at a rate that is
less than a year, we use the compound growth or decay equations. For Example 3, the compounding occurs
every 6 months and the interest rate is annual, so we must use the compound growth equation shown above.
Since the compounding occurs 2 times per year (there are 2 6-month periods each year), n = 2. The initial

value is $2,000, so P = 2,000. The rate of growth is 4%, so r = 0.04. We are finding the investment value in
3 years, sot = 3. Plugging all of these values into the compound growth equation, we get:
. “—

Value in 3 Years = 2,000 (1 + >

0.04 6

= 2,000 (1 + —)

The answer is D.

If the question had no compounding and the investment just had an annual interest rate of 4%, we would use
the simpler equations we learned at the start of this chapters and the correct answer would be A.
Again, this topic is very rarely tested on the ACT, but it has been on the test before and is fair game. You
should memorize both forms of the exponential growth and decay equations we learned in this chapter if you
are aiming for top math scores.
