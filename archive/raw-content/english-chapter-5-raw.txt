Chapter 5: Pronouns
Pronouns are words that stand in for a person, place, or thing. On the ACT, you will need to know how to

select the proper pronoun based on case (“he’” vs. “him” or “who” vs. “whom”), make sure that a pronoun
agrees with the word it is replacing, and spot ambiguous pronouns.

Pronoun Case
To start, let’s work on pronoun case. Pronouns have two cases: subject and object. The pronoun’s role
in the sentence (subject or object) dictates which type of pronoun is correct.

Subject

Singular

Object

Plural

Singular

Plural

I

We

Me

Us

You

You

He/She/It

They

Him/Her/It

Them

Who

Who

Whom

Whom

For simple pronoun case questions, it will be easy to tell which pronoun is correct. Just trust your ear!
(They/them) went to the street festival on Saturday afternoon.
The man handed (we/us) a stack of flyers.
One type of more advanced pronouns question occurs when the pronoun is in a list. Since we often say

pronouns in a list incorrectly, we may no longer be able to simply “hear” which pronoun is correct. Fora
pronoun ina list, ignore the other items in the list and just read the pronoun to tell which is
correct.

The policeman asked to speak to my friends and (me/]).
His girlfriend and (he/him) went to the hockey game.
The entire gang and (they/them) are responsible for this.
At times, pronouns are also included in a prepositional phrase. Pronouns in prepositional phrases
always are in the object case. Remember this rule, as it can be difficult to tell which on is correct by
just using your ear.

The bet between Joe and (I/me) was for just five dollars.
To (who/whom) was the award given to?
Jerry claims that a great rivalry exists among Tim, Scott, and (he/him).

Who vs. Whom
You need to know the difference between “who” and “whom,” as it is tested on almost every ACT.
Technically, “who” is the subject of the sentence, and “whom” is the object. But knowing that is not very
helpful. Here’s the trick you need to memorize:

If you can replace the word with “he,” “she,” or “they,” use “who.”
If you can replace the word with “him,” “her,” or “them,” use “whom.”
You may need to rearrange the sentence a bit, but this trick will work for any who vs. whom question.

Try with the examples below:
(Who/whom) stole the apple off the teacher’s desk?
To (who/whom) should I address this letter?
(Who/whom) do you want to the win the Bachelor?

TIP - Who vs. Whom in Phrases
On more difficult questions, who/whom can also be used to introduce a phrase describing a person.

Using our normal “he/him” trick does not work if we look at the entire sentence. However, if we just
look at the phrase on its own, the trick still works.
The child (who/whom) | invited to the party was very noisy.
The child (who/whom) was running down the street was very noisy.

If we plug in “he” or “him” to the entire sentence, neither sounds correct. To tell if it is “who” or
“whom,” only look at the phrase, which is in the brackets below.
The child | (who/whom) I invited to the party| was very noisy.
The child | (who/whom) was running down the street| was very noisy.

If we just look at the phrase, can we say, “he | invited to the party?” No, but we could say, “I invited
him to the party,” so the first one must be “whom.” If we look at the second example, we can say, “he
was running down the street,” so “who” is correct.
The second trick involves looking at the next word after “who” or “whom.” If the word right after is
a verb, use “who.” If the word right after is a noun, use “whom.” In the first example, “I” is a noun,
so we use “whom.” In the second example, “was” is a verb, so we use “who.”
1.

On my way to the farmer’s market, I ran into my childhood best friend, (who/whom) | had not
seen in years.

2.

I could not believe how much the florists (who/whom) opened up a shop down the street charge
for their roses.

3.

After the investigation, the owner fired the employee (who/whom) the private investigator

identified as the one responsible for stealing over $5,000 of company funds.

TIP - Reflexive Pronouns
Reflexive pronouns, which use the “-self” ending (myself, yourself, himself...), can only be used when
the pronoun is referring back to a person or thing elsewhere in the sentence or in previous sentences.
Incorrect: I grabbed three donuts and put them in a box for me.
Correct: I grabbed three donuts and put them in a box for myself.
Incorrect:

| asked my coworker to put three donuts in a box for myself.

Correct: | asked my coworker to put three donuts in a box for me.

Possessive Pronouns
At times, pronouns will also be used to show possession. It is important that these pronouns still match
with the word(s) that are being replaced (we will cover this more on the next page).

Incorrect: The entire team went on stage to pick up their trophy.
Correct: The entire team went on stage to pick up its trophy.

The pronoun here is referring back to “team,” which is singular. In order to match correctly, we must
use the singular pronoun “its.” Try with the examples below:
Emmanuel and James came back home after forgetting (his/their) phones.
Thousands of tourists travel to Egypt each year to see (its/their) ancient pyramids.

Pronoun Agreement
Pronouns must agree with the antecedent, which is the noun that the pronoun is replacing. Whenever
you see a pronoun on the ACT, you must find exactly who or what it is referring to. The antecedent
can be in the same sentence as the pronoun or in a preceding sentence. The antecedent can also be
anywhere in the sentence (unnecessary information, prepositional phrases, etc).
Pronouns must match the antecedent in terms of plurality and gender. A singular antecedent must
have a singular pronoun; a plural antecedent must have a plural pronoun. A male antecedent must have
a male pronoun; a female antecedent must have a female pronoun.

Ambiguous Pronouns
For a pronoun to be correct, we must know exactly who or what it is referring to. If we do not know
exactly who or what a pronoun is referring to, the pronoun is ambiguous and is always incorrect.
Incorrect: Stephen smiled at his father as he threw the ball.

We do not know if “he” is referring to Stephen or his father, so “he” is ambiguous and incorrect.
Correct: Stephen smiled at his father as his father threw the ball.

Even though it may seem redundant, replacing “he” with “his father” fixes the ambiguous pronoun error.
Incorrect: Even though the order had not yet shown up, the librarian insisted that she had
ordered some.

We have no idea what “some” is referring to in this sentence.
Correct: Even though the order had not yet shown up, the librarian insisted that she had
ordered four copies of the new book.

TIP - Spotting Ambiguous Pronouns Questions
Anytime you see a pronoun in the answer choices, check to see if the pronoun is ambiguous. Here are
all of the pronouns you should Keep an eye out for: he, him, his, she, her, hers, they, them, their, it,
its, this, that, these, those, some, none.
On the ACT, ambiguous pronouns questions look something like this:

A.

NO CHANGE

C.

one of them.

D.

some.

asked for one.

B. aslider.

In the first example, the answer is C because we need to specify who is the most famous. “He,” “they,”
or “it” could be referring to multiple people or things, so answer choices A, B, and D are all
ambiguous. The only answer choice that is specific is C.
In the second example, the answer is B since it specifies what James is asking for. If we just say James

asked for “one” or “one of them” or “some,” we do not know if James wants a slider or a French fry.
