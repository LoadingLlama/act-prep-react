Chapter 3: How to Approach the Reading Test — Finding
the Right Approach for You
Let’s discuss the most common approaches to the Reading Test that we recommend for our students. As you
complete this chapter, keep in mind that there is no single best approach to the ACT Reading, but there is
a best approach for you. The right approach depends on your reading speed, your reading level, and a variety
of other factors, all of which we will discuss in this chapter.
The best way to find your favorite method is trial and error. Try different methods on practice ACTs and see
which one you find the most effective. Once you find your preferred method, use that same method over and
over on practice ACTs so you feel confident in your approach for test day.

Our 6 Approaches for ACT Reading Passages
We have 6 different approaches that we recommend for our students, all of which we will learn shortly in this
chapter. In the rest of this chapter, we will go into each approach and teach you the method. In addition, we
will tell you the type of student that each approach is generally good or bad for.
Our 6 approaches for the ACT Reading Test are:

1)

The Big Read

2)

The Big Read with Notes

3)

Label Then Read

4)

The Speed Reader

5)

First and Last

6)

Working Backwards

After learning the approaches, you will likely have one or two approaches that sound like they may be a good

fit for you. As you work through passages in this course and on practice tests, try different methods to
find which method is the best for you. With practice, you will find the approach that is the best for you.

Approach #1 — The Big Read
The first approach is the simplest: read the entire passage at once and then work through the questions.
e

Read the entire passage including the short intro above the passage.

e

Read to understand the passage; do not skim the passage.

e

Read the passage in 2-4 minutes (3-6 minutes for extended time) at a medium pace. Do not speed

read the passage as fast as you can. Do not read the passage slowly like it is your favorite book. The
best pace for most students is somewhere in between. The exact time depends on your reading speed
and the passage.
e

Bean active reader. At minimum, move your finger or pencil along as you read. Many students stay

more focused when they annotate as they read. Exactly how much, how little, or if you annotate is up
to you. For many students, it is helpful to do at least some annotation.
e
e

After you complete the big read, work through the questions.
Skip any broad passage questions (main idea, best summarizes the passage, the passage can be

best described as...) and save them for last. These are commonly the first question in each passage.
After answering the rest of the questions, you will better understand the entire passage, and broad
passage questions will be easier to answer correctly.
e

Go back to the passage to find the evidence that supports the correct answer to each question.

e

Follow the 30-second Rule. If you cannot find the evidence to answer the question in 30 seconds,
bubble in your best guess, circle the question number, and move on.

e

You do not need to answer the questions in order. The questions on the ACT Reading are not
strictly chronological, so you can skip a question if you have no idea where to look, are having trouble
finding the evidence, or know the question will be better to answer later. We will discuss this skill in
much more depth later in this course.

e

Once you are done answering all 9 questions, check your watch. If you still have time left on the
passage, you can go back to any questions that you circled. If not, go to the next passage.

HUMANITIES: This

passage is adapted from the article
“Winslow Homer: His Melancholy Truth” by John A. Parks
(©2006 by VNU Business Media).

The images in the paintings of Winslow Homer
epitomize a peculiarly American 19th-century world.
Through Homer’s eyes, it is a world in which people
live in close contact with nature and natural forces, a
world where landscape and ocean are viewed not as a
paradise but as powers and presences that can be
enjoyed and whose threats can sometimes be overcome.
And, particularly in his later paintings, it is a world
imbued with a stark and melancholy atmosphere.
In 1867, two of Homer’s canvases were chosen to
hang at the Great Exposition in Paris. The artist spent
10 months in the city, which later proved to have a profound effect on his art. A large display of Japanese
prints was exhibited in the same building as his own
paintings, and the process of simplification that it
revealed and the wealth of pictorial invention it provided made a deep impression on the artist. The influence of Japanese art on Homer’s painting was
immediately apparent upon his return to the United
20 States. The weakness of earlier compositions is
replaced by a boldness and lucidity in which simple
shapes are massed into powerful designs.
Although Homer’s work of the 1870s gained
strength, the artist continued to paint his genre subjects:
25 tourist scenes, schoolchildren, and farm life. It wasn’t
until 1881, however, that he found the subject matter
that would inspire him most. In that year, for reasons
unknown, Homer went to England, where he elected to
spend the summer at the town of Tynemouth on the
30 coast of the North Sea. It is possible that he was searching for a town filled with the type of tourists and
bathers that made his paintings of the Jersey shore successful back home. But Tynemouth was also a community of fishermen who wrested their livelihood from the
35 dangerous and unpredictable waters of the North Sea.
Moreover, the light and weather in that part of the
world, so much farther north than Atlantic City, is
much gloomier and more dramatic than that of the
Jersey coast. It was there that Homer became enthralled
40 by the dramas of the people who make their living from
the ocean: the fishermen’s wives staring out to sea as
they wait for their men, the launch of the lifeboat to
rescue sailors from a foundering ship, the agonizingly
fragile fishing boats being tossed on angry waves. Here
45 at last was a subject matter that matched the artist’s
deepest feelings. The dynamic and dangerous relationship between human activity and natural forces exposed
in this setting would occupy Homer for many years to
come. On his return to America he elected to leave New
50 York and relocate to the rural town of Prouts Neck,
Maine.
The legend of Winslow Homer is that he left New
York civilization to become a recluse on the coast of
Maine for the last 25 years of his life. In reality, the

55 property at Prouts Neck—which included a

large, rambling hotel building—was purchased by his brother
Charles for the whole extended Homer family. The
artist also built a studio with an ocean view just yards
away from the family house so throughout the summers
he could enjoy the company of his father, his brothers
and their wives, as well as the year-round guests of the
many local people whose friendship he valued. Homer
continued to travel frequently, spending parts of the
winter in the Caribbean. But the artist always lived
65 alone, and when he was working, which was the large
part of most of his days, he could be extremely shorttempered when interrupted.
The sea outside his window now inspired the artist
to create what came to be known as his greatest paint70 ings. The Maine coast is extremely rocky and prone to
monstrous gales that—at their most powerful—can
whip up the waves to 40 or 50 feet. Screaming winds
can rip across the breakers, creating long horizontal
trails of spray. Homer rendered this sea with all the
75 understanding of a painter who knows to simplify and
synthesize. In paintings such as Eastern Point and
Cannon Rock the construction of the water has been
reorganized into clear graphic shapes and strong directional lines that echo the Japanese printmaking that had
such a lasting effect on his work. The rocks in the
paintings are massed into powerful, almost flat, designs
and the brushing has become energetic, as though feeding from the physical strength of the ocean. These
paintings take on an abstract grandeur that has justly
85 made them famous. They remain, however, haunting
evocations of the eternal power of the ocean.

21. The main purpose of the passage is to:

A.
B.
C.
D.

describe an artist’s most famous painting and the
experience that inspired it.
explore the relationship between the natural world
and the fine arts.
provide an overview of an artist’s career and
important influences on that artist’s work.
describe the work of artists who epitomized a
peculiarly American nineteenth-century world.

22. It can reasonably be inferred from the passage that
which of the following scenes would most likely be the
subject of a painting created by Homer late in his life?

F.

A family strolling along the boardwalk in Atlantic
City
G. A fishing boat being violently pitched about on a

Approach #2 — The Big Read with Notes
The second approach is identical to the Big Read except that you write down a quick note after every 10-15
lines or after each paragraph that summarizes what is being discussed.
e

Read the entire passage including the short intro above the passage.

e

Read to understand the passage; do not skim the passage.

e

Read the passage in 2-4 minutes (3-6 minutes for extended time) at a medium pace. Do not speed

read it as fast as you can. Do not read it slowly like it is your favorite book. The best pace for most
students is somewhere in between. The exact time depends on your reading speed and the passage.
e

Write down a note after every 10-15 lines or after each paragraph. The note can be a single word
or a short phrase. Having to write down a note forces you to stay focused on the passage and helps
you more quickly find the correct part of the passage when answering the questions.

e
e

After you read the entire passage, work through the questions.
Skip any broad passage questions (main idea, best summarizes the passage, the passage can be

best described as...) and save them for last. These are commonly the first question in each passage.
After answering the rest of the questions, you will better understand the entire passage, and broad
passage questions will be easier to answer correctly.
e

Go back to the passage and use your notes to find the evidence in the passage that supports the
correct answer for each question.

e

Follow the 30-second Rule. If you cannot find the evidence to answer the question in 30 seconds,
bubble in your best guess, circle the question number, and move on.

e

You do not need to answer the questions in order. The questions on the ACT Reading are not
strictly chronological, so you can skip a question if you have no idea where to look, are having trouble
finding the evidence, or know the question will be better to answer later. We will discuss this skill in
much more depth later in this course.

e

Once you are done answering all 9 questions, check your watch. If you still have time left on the
passage, you can go back to any questions that you circled. If not, go to the next passage.

Approach #3 — Label Then Read
The third approach involves looking at the questions first. However, you are NOT reading all the questions.
Instead, you are looking for any questions that reference a specific line or paragraph and labelling

where those questions are in the passage. Make sure to label where the line is with the question number.
For example, if question 3 says “in lines 30-33,” go put a 3 next to lines 30-33. As you read the passage, you

will know to read closely when you get to the lines for question 3.
Note: This method can be used with either The Big Read or The Big Read with Notes.
e

Skim the questions and look for line references in the questions or specific references to a

paragraph. This skim should only take a maximum of 20-30 seconds. Ifa question says, “in lines
45-46” or “the third paragraph,” we label where those questions are. Do NOT read the entire
question. Only look for line references.

e

Label where the lines for questions are in the passage with the question number. If question 25 is
in lines 45-46, put a 25 next to those lines.

e

Read the passage.

e

As you get to lines that are labelled, there are 2 options:

1)

Read the context carefully and then answer the question. Make sure to always read before
and after the labelled lines to get enough context.

2)

Read the question first and then read the lines carefully. By reading the question first, you
know what you are looking for and can often answer the question more quickly.

e

Ifyou do not have enough context to answer the question from what you have read so far, skip the
question and save it for later.

e

For purpose questions with line references, be careful! Make sure you have read enough context to
answer the question properly. If you do not have enough context, skip the question, and save it for
later.

e

Continue to read the passage, repeating this process for any other labelled lines.

e

After you have read the entire passage, answer questions that you have not answered yet.

e

Save broad passage questions (main idea, best summarizes the passage, the passage can be best

described as...) for last. These are commonly the first question in each passage. After answering the
rest of the questions, you will better understand the entire passage, and broad passage questions will
be easier to answer correctly.

The 2-Sentence Rule
For any question with a line reference or when you find the appropriate keywords, read 2 sentences

before and 2 sentences after. The evidence is most commonly in the 2 sentences before or after the line
reference or the keywords.

Passage Il
SOCIAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the article

“Travels with R.L.S.” by James Campbell (©2000 by The New
York Times Company).

Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-1894) preferred to
circumnavigate civilization, with its increasing reliance
on contraptions, and steer toward the rougher fringes.
He self-consciously turned his back on the Victorian
5 idol, progress. In similar spirit, he chose the past more
often than the present as a setting for fiction. His most
popular novels—Treasure Island, Kidnapped, The
Master of Ballantrae—are set in a semimythical realm,
where the fire of adventure catches on every page.
10 Stevenson loved the sound of clashing swords; he
didn’t want them getting tangled up in telephone wires
overhead.

Stevenson, though, was destined to be a modern
man. He was born into a Scottish family of civil engi15 neers, esteemed for its technological genius. His grandfather, also Robert, was Britain’s greatest builder of
lighthouses, and his graceful towers continue to guide
sailors today. Three of Robert’s sons followed him into
the profession, including Robert Louis Stevenson’s
20 father, Thomas, who made his own mark in the field of
optics—his louvre-boarded screens for the protection of
thermometers are still in use today.
It was expected that Robert Louis would enter the
family business in turn, and a great wringing of hands
25 greeted his announcement to the contrary. He told his
father that he wanted to be a writer, which Thomas
Stevenson regarded as no profession at all. We can
imagine the consternation when Stevenson’s letters
arrived bearing pleas such as “Take me as I am... I
30 must be a bit of a vagabond.” And a vagabond was precisely what he set out to be: longhaired, careless about
food, walking through France or planning an epic ocean
voyage, a far cry from the offices of D. & T. Stevenson,
Engineers. He was forging the template for generations
35 of college-educated adventurers to come. “I travel not
to go anywhere, but to go,” he wrote in Travels With a
Donkey (1879). “I travel for travel’s sake. The great
affair is to move.”

40

45

50

55

Stevenson would not be an engineer, but he left his
own lights, in Scotland and across the world, by which
it is possible to trace his unceasing movement. No other
writer, surely, is as much memorialized by the words
“lived here” as he is. There are five houses with
Stevenson associations in Edinburgh alone, not to mention the little schoolhouse he attended as a child and the
lavish gardens opposite the family home in Heriot Row,
where he played and, the fanciful will have you believe,
first acted out the quest for Treasure Island. I have
shadowed Stevenson up to the northeast of Scotland,
where he tried his hand at being an apprentice engineer,
back down to the Hawes Inn at South Queensferry,
where David Balfour is tricked into going to sea in Kidnapped. There are landmarks in Switzerland, France
and on the Pacific Islands where the adventure of his
final years took place.

13. The main idea of the second paragraph (lines 13-22) is
that:
A.
B.

C.

D.

Stevenson’s grandfather insisted his sons become
educated in civil engineering.
Stevenson was a modern man whose engineering
talents were suppressed by his desire to be a
writer.
Stevenson’s father earned greater esteem for his
louvre-boarded screens than Stevenson’s grandfather did for his lighthouses.
Stevenson was the grandson, son, and nephew of
men respected for their technological genius.

14. The main idea of the fifth paragraph (lines 56-70) is
that:

F._
G.
H.

J.

the plot of one of Stevenson’s books was inspired
by his vision of electric lights in London.
Stevenson envisioned the use of electric streetlights in London before they became reality.
Stevenson longed for a time when electricity
would replace flickering gas lamps.
Stevenson realized that his father’s improvements
in optics would become the “technological miracle
of the future.”

Recently, I stumbled across Abernethy House
where Stevenson lived briefly in London when he was
23. It stands in a secluded corner of Hampstead, high
up on a hill, and separated from foggy London by farms
60 and heath. It was while standing on Hampstead Hill one
night that he gazed down on London and imagined a
technological miracle of the future, “when in a moment,
in the twinkling of an eye, the design of the monstrous
city flashes into vision—a glittering hieroglyph.” He is
65 anticipating the effects of electricity and a time when
the streetlamps would be lighted “not one by one” by
the faithful old lamplighter, but all at once, by the touch
of a button. Not for him improvements in optics;
give him the flickering gas lamp and the “skirts of
70 civilization” any day.
Lamps occur frequently in Stevenson’s writing.
There are the essays “A Plea for Gas Lamps” and “The
Lantern Bearers,” and his poem for children, “The
Lamplighter,” which celebrates an old custom: “For we
75 are very lucky, with a lamp before the door, / And
Leerie stops to light it as he lights so many more.”
Then there is his memoir in which he describes how,
when a child and sick, his nurse would take him to the
window, “whence I might look forth into the blue night
80 starred with street lamps, and see where the gas still
burned behind the windows of other sickrooms.” And
the lights shine again, with a subdued glow, in the obituary he wrote of his father. Thomas Stevenson’s name
may not have been widely known, yet “all the time, his
85 lights were in every part of the world, guiding the
mariner.”
A year later, Stevenson chartered a schooner and
became a mariner himself, sailing circuitously through
the South Seas. He had, in a sense, entered the family
90 business at last.

11. As it is used in line 3, the phrase “the rougher fringes”
most nearly means the same as which of the following
phrases?
A.
B.
C.
D.

“The fire of adventure” (line 9)
“An epic ocean voyage” (lines 32-33)
“A glittering hieroglyph” (line 64)
“Skirts of civilization” (lines 69-70)

12. It can reasonably be concluded that the passage author

is a credible source of biographical information about
Stevenson because the passage author:
F.

G.
H.
J.

traveled to several towns and countries where

Stevenson lived and worked to research him.
has read Stevenson’s two most popular novels,
Kidnapped and Treasure Island.
worked for a time in the offices of D. & T. Stevenson, Engineers, as Stevenson had.
comes from Edinburgh, where the adventure of
Stevenson’s final years took place.

17. As it is used in line 24, the phrase “a great wringing of
hands” most nearly refers to the Stevenson family’s:
A.
B
C.
D.

dismay over Stevenson’s announcement that he
wasn’t joining the family business.
disapproval of Stevenson’s slovenly appearance
and poor diet.
humiliation at Stevenson publicly renouncing the
family business in favor of traveling.
consternation at receiving Stevenson’s letters
pleading to have his family accept his choice.

18. It can most reasonably be inferred from the passage
that as a traveler, Stevenson:
F.

G.
H.
J.

thought reaching the destination was what made

the trip worthwhile.
encouraged other young men to take up traveling
rather than pursue an education.
was searching for a model for the character David
Balfour in Kidnapped.
was happiest when he was on an adventure with no
itinerary.

15. According to the passage, which of the professions

listed below did Stevenson enter into?
I.
II.
III.
IV.
V.
A.
B.

Approach #4 — The Speed Reader
The fourth approach is our first method that does not require reading the entire passage. With this approach,
you read the first few sentences of a paragraph until you get an idea of what the paragraph is about,
write down a quick note, and then skip ahead to the start of the next paragraph and repeat. You do not

read (or even skim) the entire paragraph. The goal with The Speed Reader is to, of course, get through the
passage faster and have more time to answer the questions.
e

Read the first sentence(s) of the paragraph. Read only enough to get an idea of what topic(s) the

paragraph is about. Usually, you should be reading 1-3 sentences. Once you feel like you have an
idea of what the paragraph is about, stop reading.
e

Write a note next to the paragraph. The note can be a single word or a short phrase. You will use
your notes as you answer the questions.

e

Go to the start of the next paragraph and repeat the process. Repeat the process until you have
read the entire passage and written down notes for each paragraph.

e

Skip any broad passage questions (main idea, best summarizes the passage, the passage can be

best described as...) and save them for last. These are commonly the first question in each passage.
After answering the rest of the questions, you will better understand the entire passage, and broad
passage questions will be easier to answer correctly.
e

Answer questions with line references first. Use the 2-sentence rule. As you answer line reference
questions, you will read more of the passage, which will likely help you with other questions.

e

Next, read the remaining questions and use your notes to find where to go in the passage.

o

Ifyou remember where to read in the passage to answer the question, answer it right away.

o

Ifyou think you have a good guess as to where to read, try to answer the question. If you
cannot find the evidence after 30 seconds, bubble in your best guess, circle the question
number, and go to the next question.

o
e

Ifyou have no idea where to read, skip the question and save it for later.

Return to any questions that you have skipped and try to find the evidence. Again, follow the 30
second rule. If you cannot find the evidence to answer the question in 30 seconds, bubble in your best
guess, circle the question number, and move on.

e

e

Finally, answer any broad passage questions.

Once you are done answering all 9 questions, check your watch. If you still have time left on the
passage, you can go back to any questions that you circled. If not, go to the next passage.

Passage |
LITERARY NARRATIVE: This passage is adapted from the
novel The Cat’s Table by Michael Ondaatje (©2011 by Michael

Ondaatje).
The ship Oronsay is departing from Colombo, Ceylon (a city in
what is today Sri Lanka), in the early 1950s.

Michael was eleven years old that night when,
green as he could be about the world, he climbed
aboard the first and only ship of his life. It felt as if a
city had been added to the coast, better lit than any
a town or village. He went up the gangplank, watching
only the path of his feet—nothing ahead of him
existed—and continued till he faced the dark harbour
and sea. There were outlines of other ships farther out,
beginning to turn on lights. He stood alone, smelling
everything, then came back through the noise and the
crowd to the side that faced land. A yellow glow over
the city. Already it felt there was a wall between him
and what took place there. Stewards began handing out
food and cordials. He ate several sandwiches, and after
that he made his way down to his cabin, undressed, and
slipped into the narrow bunk. He’d never slept under a
blanket before, save once in Nuwara Eliya. He was
wide awake. The cabin was below the level of the
waves, so there was no porthole. He found a switch
beside the bed and when he pressed it his head and
pillow were suddenly lit by a cone of light.
He did not go back up on deck for a last look, or to
wave at his relatives who had brought him to the harbour. He could hear singing and imagined the slow and
25 then eager parting of families taking place in the
thrilling night air. I do not know, even now, why he
chose this solitude. Had whoever brought him onto the
Oronsay already left? In films people tear themselves
away from one another weeping, and the ship separates
from land while the departed hold on to those disappearing faces until all distinction is lost.

What had there been before such a ship in my life?
A dugout canoe on a river journey? A launch in Trincomalee harbour? There were always fishing boats on our
40 horizon. But I could never have imagined the grandeur
of this castle that was to cross the sea. The longest journeys I had made were car rides to Nuwara Eliya and
Horton Plains, or the train to Jaffna, which we boarded
at seven a.m. and disembarked from in the late after45 noon. We made that journey with our egg sandwiches, a
pack of cards, and a small Boy’s Own adventure.
But now it had been arranged I would be travelling
to England by ship, and that I would be making the
journey alone. No mention was made that this might be
50 an unusual experience or that it could be exciting or
dangerous, so I did not approach it with any joy or fear.
I was not forewarned that the ship would have seven
levels, hold more than six hundred people including a
captain, nine cooks, engineers, a veterinarian, and that
5: a it would contain a small jail and chlorinated pools that
would actually sail with us over two oceans. The departure date was marked casually on the calendar by my
aunt, who had notified the school that I would be leaving at the end of the term. The fact of my being at sea
60 for twenty-one days was spoken of as having not much
significance, so I was surprised my relatives were even
bothering to accompany me to the harbour. I had
assumed I would be taking a bus by myself and then
change onto another at Borella Junction.
There had been just one attempt to introduce me to
the situation of the journey. A lady named Flavia Prins,
whose husband knew my uncle, turned out to be making
the same journey and was invited to tea one afternoon
to meet with me. She would be travelling in First Class
70 but promised to keep an eye on me. I shook her hand
carefully, as it was covered with rings and bangles, and
she then turned away to continue the conversation I had
interrupted. I spent most of the hour listening to a few
uncles and counting how many of the trimmed sand75 wiches they ate.
65

I try to imagine who the boy on the ship was. Perhaps a sense of self is not even there in his nervous
stillness in the narrow bunk, in this green grasshopper
35 or little cricket, as if he has been smuggled away accidentally, with no knowledge of the act, into the future.

On my last day, I found an empty school examination booklet, a pencil, a pencil sharpener, a traced map
of the world, and put them into my small suitcase.

Approach #5 — First and Last
The fifth approach is our second method that does not require reading the entire passage. With this approach,
you read the first 1-2 sentences of a paragraph and the last 1-2 sentences of a paragraph to get get an
idea of what the paragraph is about, write down a quick note, and then repeat on the next paragraph.

You do not read (or even skim) the middle portions of the paragraph. The goal with The First and Last is
to get through the passage faster and have more time to answer the questions.
Compared to The Speed Reader, you are reading slightly more of the passage with First and Last. As a result,
you should understand the passage better than with The Speed Reader, but you will spend more time reading
and will have somewhat less time on the questions.
Read the first 1-2 sentences of the paragraph and the last 1-2 sentences of the paragraph. Use

your best judgment regarding how much of the first and last sentences of the paragraph to read. If the
first sentence already gives you an idea of what the paragraph is about, skip to the last sentence(s). If
not, keep reading until you have a rough idea of the paragraph’s topic.
Write a note next to the paragraph. The note can be a single word or a short phrase. You will use
your notes as you answer the questions.
Go to the start of the next paragraph and repeat the process. Repeat the process until you have
read the entire passage and written down notes for each paragraph.
Skip any broad passage questions (main idea, best summarizes the passage, the passage can be

best described as...) and save them for last. These are commonly the first question in each passage.
After answering the rest of the questions, you will better understand the entire passage, and broad
passage questions will be easier to answer correctly.
Answer questions with line references first. Use the 2-sentence rule. As you answer line reference
questions, you will read more of the passage, which will likely help you with other questions.
Next, read the remaining questions and use your notes to find where to go in the passage.

o

Ifyou remember where to read to answer the question, answer it right away.

o

Ifyou think you have a good guess as to where to read, try to answer the question. If you
cannot find the evidence after 30 seconds, bubble in your best guess, circle the question
number, and go to the next question.

o

Ifyou have no idea where to read, skip the question and save it for later.

Return to any questions that you have skipped and try to find the evidence. Again, follow the 30
second rule. If you cannot find the evidence to answer the question in 30 seconds, bubble in your best
guess, circle the question number, and move on.
Finally, answer any broad passage questions.

Once you are done answering all 9 questions, check your watch. If you still have time left on the
passage, you can go back to any questions that you circled. If not, go to the next passage.

Approach #6 — Working Backwards
The final method is going straight to the questions and then working backwards. We recommend this
method if you cannot finish the passages in time with another method we have discussed or if you find

yourself getting to the end of the passage and not recalling what you read. Students we generally advise to
work backwards are slower readers who cannot finish all 4 passages in time or do not retain what they have
read well. Even if that is you, make sure to only use this method if it helps you increase you score.
The other time we recommend this method is if you have mismanaged time and get to the final passage

with 4 minutes left or less (or 7 minutes left or less for extended time). If you have that little time left,

reading the passage will use up most of your time. You will most likely be able to answer more questions
correctly by going straight to the questions.
e

Go straight to the questions before reading the passage.

e

Skip any broad questions that ask about the entire passage. Save those for last.

e

Look for questions to answer first that reference specific lines or a paragraph of the passage.

Other easy questions to answer right away are words in context questions.
e

Next, look for clear evidence questions. We will learn how to spot these questions in Chapter 5.

e

Next, answer inference questions and then purpose questions. We will learn how to spot these
questions in Chapter 5.

e

Use the 2-Sentence Rule. Always read 2 sentences before and after the line reference or

keywords, as that is most commonly where the evidence is located. In addition, you will read most of
the passage as you work through the questions, so you will be ready to answer the broad passage
questions at the end.
e

Save the broad passage questions for last. If you are running out of time, skip the inference
questions and answer the broad passage questions using the information you know about the passage.

We will discuss this method more later in the course in Chapter 11. After
you have learned more about keywords and question types, we will revisit
Working Backwards and explain this method in more depth.

Students who find that they do not remember important details after reading the passage.
Students who mismanaged time and do not have enough time to use their normal approach on the final
passage.

Students who have already been using this method and are scoring very well.

Who it’s bad for:
Students who can finish the Reading Test with The Big Read, The Big Read with Notes, or Label
Then Read. The ACT Reading Test requires you to find specific evidence from the passage. It is

much more difficult to find the evidence in the passage consistently when working backwards. If you
are currently working backwards and missing 4-8 questions on the entire Reading Test, you may be
able to increase your score with one of the other methods.
Generally, students aiming for 32-36 on the Reading Test. To score a 32-36, you can usually only
miss 0-3 questions. If you never read the passage, you are far more likely to get questions wrong
because you did not find the correct evidence. That being said, we have had students score perfectly
Working Backwards, so it is all about finding what approach is best for you.

How to Approach Dual Text Passages
Each ACT Reading Test will have 1 dual text passage with two shorter passages labelled as Passage A and
Passage B. The two passages discuss similar topics and will somehow be related. For example, a Literary
Narrative passage could have two authors discussing two similar experiences, and a Natural Science passage
could have two scientists offering differing opinions on a recent discovery.
When working on a dual text passage, we recommend that you read each passage separately. Do not read
both passages before starting the questions. Instead, you should use the following approach:
1.

Read Passage A and answer questions for Passage A.

2.

Read Passage B and answer questions for Passage B.

3.

Answer questions about both passages.

When reading the passage, you should still apply whatever method you prefer from the ones we already
discussed (The Big Read, The Big Read with Notes, Label Then Read, The Speed Reader, First and Last, or
Working Backwards).

In Dual Text Passages, the questions go in the following order:
