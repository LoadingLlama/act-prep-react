At first glance, Science passages often look intimidating with unfamiliar topics like the migratory patterns of monarch butterflies or the crystallization of magma, but success comes from understanding that you don't need to be a science expert—you need to be skilled at quickly locating and analyzing data in charts, graphs, and tables. Mastering an efficient approach strategy is critical because you have only 35 minutes to handle 6 passages (approximately 5-6 minutes per passage), making time management and strategic passage navigation essential for maximizing your score.

1. Charts and Graphs Passages: The 30-Second Preview Strategy
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Of the 6 passages on the Science Test, 5 will consist of mostly graphs, charts, tables, and figures
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The other passage will be the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Conflicting Viewpoints</strong> passage, which we'll discuss separately</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For the 5 Charts and Graphs passages, use the Figure-First approach described below</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Most of the information in Charts and Graphs passages is extra and unnecessary
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The majority of questions can be answered by just using the charts and graphs, not the text</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don't spend time trying to read and understand the entire passage—it's not necessary and you will run out of time!</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Instead, spend around 30 seconds before starting the questions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

What to Do in Your 30-Second Preview
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Focus on the charts and graphs, paying special attention to:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The labels of the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">axes</strong> (what variables are being measured)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">What is being measured in each chart</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Where information is located</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For the text, just read the first sentence of the passage and of the experiment(s)
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This gives you the basics of what the passage is about</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Scientists studied how temperature affects enzyme activity"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You don't need detailed understanding—just the general topic</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">After these 30 seconds, you will not fully understand the passage, but that is okay
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You now know where the information is located</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You can proceed to the questions and find specific information as needed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Question Difficulty Progression and Time Management
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Within each passage, questions go from easy to hard
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The first two or three questions are generally very straightforward, often just asking you to spot a trend or find a data point</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">As you continue to later questions, they get more difficult by asking you to use experimental thinking, use multiple charts or graphs, or consider changes to the experiment</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Since each question is worth the same amount, be sure to get the easy ones correct
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you cannot figure out one of the last two questions in a passage, bubble in your best guess, circle the question, and move on</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You can always come back to it at the end if you still have time</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It is better to take your best guess and keep moving onto the next passage rather than spend a bunch of time on the most difficult questions and run out of time at the end of the section</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
The 5-6 Minute Per Passage Rule
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Time management is crucial in this section, as it is often the hardest one for students to finish
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You should be spending between 5-6 minutes on each passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you find yourself spending more than 30 seconds on a problem, bubble in your best guess, circle the number, and move on</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You can always come back if you have time at the end</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Using Questions to Guide You to Answers
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Find the easiest and fastest way to get the correct answers by trusting the questions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If a question begins with "Based on Figure 2," it means that the answer is in Figure 2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Go to Figure 2 and find it! The ACT is not trying to trick you</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Let the questions help guide you to the right part of the passage</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">If the question does not direct you where to go, use keywords to help you
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Finding the variables discussed or units of the answer choices can quickly direct you to the right part of the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: If answer choices are in "°C," look for the figure with temperature on an axis</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Remember that you do not need to understand the experiment as a whole
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">As long as you can find the answer in the passage, just bubble it in and move on</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It's okay to answer questions before fully understanding the passage</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
When to Go Back to the Text
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">If you read a question and see a term or word you do not know or cannot find in the charts or graphs, go back to the text
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Most questions on the Science Test do not require you to know definitions of variables</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">However, if you do need the definition, it will be in <em>italics</em>, making it easy to scan the passage and find them quickly</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read the definition and then answer the question</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Conflicting Viewpoints Passages: A Different Approach
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">At some point in the Science Test, you will find the one <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Conflicting Viewpoints</strong> passage
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This passage is easy to spot by looking for headings like "Scientist 1," "Scientist 2" or "Student 1," "Student 2"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This passage generally has more text and sometimes has no charts or graphs at all</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It is important to spot this passage quickly, as you must approach it differently</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Read and Annotate Strategy
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Rather than skimming, treat this more like a Reading passage
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read and annotate the entire thing</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">As you read, underline or write down the key differences between the viewpoints</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Having these notes will help you work more quickly on the questions rather than re-reading the text over and over again</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Most students save this passage for last
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It is the most time-consuming passage because reading text takes longer than skimming charts, graphs, tables, and diagrams</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The Conflicting Viewpoints passage is often more difficult than others</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you may run out of time, it is best to run out of time on the most time-consuming passage</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Key Takeaways
</h3>

<ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>For the 5 Charts and Graphs passages, spend only 30 seconds on your initial preview: focus on chart/graph axes and labels, read just the first sentence of the passage and experiments to get the general topic, then move directly to questions—most information in the text is unnecessary and you'll run out of time if you try to read everything.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Questions within each passage progress from easy to hard, so prioritize getting the straightforward first questions correct, and if you're stuck on difficult later questions for more than 30 seconds, guess and move on—each question is worth the same points, so spending 3 minutes on one hard question while missing 3 easy ones is a losing strategy.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Trust the questions to guide you: when a question says "Based on Figure 2," the answer is in Figure 2—the ACT isn't trying to trick you—and use keywords, variables, and answer choice units to quickly locate the right chart or graph without wasting time reading unnecessary text.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>The Conflicting Viewpoints passage (identifiable by "Scientist 1/Scientist 2" headings) requires a different approach: read and annotate the entire passage like a Reading section passage, note key differences between viewpoints, and save this passage for last since it's the most time-consuming—better to run out of time on the hardest passage than on easier Charts and Graphs passages.
  </li>
