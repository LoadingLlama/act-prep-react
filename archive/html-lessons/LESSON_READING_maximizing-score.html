Maximizing your ACT Reading score requires synthesizing all individual skills and strategies into a cohesive, personalized approach that optimizes your performance under real test conditions, combining <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">efficient time management</strong>, strategic passage selection, smart guessing techniques, and psychological preparation to ensure you answer the maximum number of questions correctly within the 35-minute time constraint. While mastering individual skills—finding main ideas, analyzing answer choices, understanding different question types—is essential, true score maximization comes from the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">strategic orchestration</strong> of these skills into test-day tactics that account for fatigue management, optimal question order, calibrated risk-taking, and adaptive decision-making when you encounter difficulty. This lesson provides seven comprehensive, actionable tips that address the most impactful aspects of Reading test performance, from <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">passage ordering strategies</strong> that build confidence and maximize completed questions, to <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">intelligent guessing methods</strong> that improve your odds on uncertain questions, to mental preparation techniques that maintain focus and composure throughout the 35-minute endurance challenge. Each tip integrates multiple skills and concepts from previous lessons, showing you how to deploy them strategically rather than randomly, creating a systematic approach that consistently produces your best possible score regardless of the specific passages or questions you encounter on test day.

1. Strategic Passage Selection and Ordering
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
The order in which you tackle passages significantly impacts your score. Strategic passage selection allows you to build confidence, optimize energy usage, and ensure you complete passages that play to your strengths before fatigue sets in.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Tip #1: Do Passages in Order of Your Strength, Not Test Order
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
The ACT presents passages in a fixed order—typically prose fiction, social science, humanities, natural science—but <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">you don't have to complete them in this order</strong>. Most students automatically start with Passage 1, but strategic test-takers choose passage order based on personal strengths and preferences. Benefits of strategic ordering: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Build early confidence</strong>—starting with your strongest passage type (the one you consistently score highest on in practice) generates momentum and confidence that carries through the test. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Guarantee completion of strength passages</strong>—if time runs short, you've already completed passages where you score best, maximizing your total points. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Reduce time pressure stress</strong>—starting successfully reduces anxiety, allowing clearer thinking. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Save difficult passages for when you're warmed up</strong>—after completing 1-2 passages successfully, you're in test-mode mentally and can tackle harder material. To implement: During practice tests, track your accuracy and speed by passage type. Identify your strongest and weakest types. On test day, quickly scan all four passages (10 seconds each), identify types, then complete them in order: strongest first, weakest last. Use your answer sheet strategically—bubble answers for the passage you're doing, not necessarily in numerical order. Just be careful to bubble the correct question numbers.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Tip #2: Complete Easier Questions First Within Each Passage
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Within each passage, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">not all questions are equally difficult</strong>. Strategic question ordering maximizes points per minute spent. Easy-to-identify easy questions include: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Line reference questions</strong>—these direct you to specific locations, requiring less searching and synthesis. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Vocabulary in context questions</strong>—typically quick if you understand context. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Direct detail questions</strong>—asking what the passage explicitly states. More challenging questions include: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Complex inference questions</strong>—requiring synthesis of multiple passage elements. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Function questions</strong>—asking why the author included something, requiring understanding of rhetorical purpose. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Tone/attitude questions</strong> on subtle passages. Strategy: As you work through questions, if you encounter one that seems confusing or time-consuming, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">skip it and mark it for return</strong>. Complete all straightforward questions first, then return to difficult ones with remaining time. This ensures you capture all "easy" points before investing time in harder questions. You'd rather answer 8 easy questions correctly and miss 2 hard ones than spend so much time on 2 hard questions that you miss 3 easy ones you never reached.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Managing Time Across All Four Passages
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
With 35 minutes for 40 questions across 4 passages, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">time management is critical</strong>. The math: 35 minutes ÷ 4 passages = 8 minutes 45 seconds per passage. However, equal division isn't always optimal. Better approach: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Target 8-9 minutes per passage</strong>, but allow flexibility. Some passages (easier ones, shorter paired passages) might take 7-8 minutes, while harder ones might take 9-10 minutes. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check time after each passage</strong>—after completing Passage 1, you should have ~26 minutes left; after Passage 2, ~17-18 minutes; after Passage 3, ~8-9 minutes. If you're behind schedule: identify where time was lost (slow reading? excessive rereading? difficult questions?) and adjust accordingly on remaining passages. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Build in a 2-3 minute buffer</strong>—aim to finish all passages with 2-3 minutes remaining for review or difficult questions you skipped. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Never spend more than 10 minutes on any single passage</strong>—if you're approaching 10 minutes and still have questions remaining, make your best guesses on remaining questions and move on. It's better to have 9 minutes for the last passage than 11 minutes for one passage and 7 minutes for another.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
The Two-Pass Strategy for Time Crunches
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
If you consistently struggle to finish all four passages, implement a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">two-pass strategy</strong>: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">First pass</strong>—complete three passages fully (your three strongest types) in about 25-26 minutes. This ensures you thoroughly address 30 questions. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Second pass</strong>—with 9-10 minutes remaining, tackle the fourth passage using a modified approach: read more quickly, focus on answering straightforward questions (line reference, detail, vocabulary), make educated guesses on difficult questions. This strategy prioritizes maximizing correct answers over comprehensive treatment of all passages. It's better to answer 30 questions with 90% accuracy and 10 questions with 60% accuracy (33 correct) than to rush through all 40 questions with 70% accuracy (28 correct). The two-pass strategy accepts that under time constraints, strategic incompleteness beats rushed completeness. Practice this approach to determine if it improves your total correct answers. For some students, the reduced time pressure on the first three passages increases accuracy enough to offset lower performance on the fourth passage.
</p>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #3b82f6; padding: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Strategic Passage Ordering</strong><br><br>
<strong>Student Profile:</strong> Strongest on social science and natural science (averages 8-9/10 correct), weakest on prose fiction (averages 5-6/10 correct), moderate on humanities (7-8/10 correct)<br><br>
<strong>Test Booklet Order:</strong> 1. Prose Fiction, 2. Social Science, 3. Humanities, 4. Natural Science<br><br>
<strong>Strategic Order:</strong><br>
1st: Social Science (strength passage—build confidence) - 8 minutes<br>
2nd: Natural Science (strength passage—momentum continues) - 8 minutes<br>
3rd: Humanities (moderate passage—tackle while still fresh) - 9 minutes<br>
4th: Prose Fiction (weakness—save for last, when warmed up) - 10 minutes<br><br>
<strong>Result:</strong> By doing strengths first, student guarantees strong performance on 20 questions (likely 16-18 correct). Even if prose fiction goes poorly at the end (5-6 correct), total score is strong. Compare to original order: if prose fiction first causes frustration and time overrun, it negatively impacts all subsequent passages.<br><br>
<strong>Bubbling Strategy:</strong> After completing Social Science (test's Passage 2), bubble questions 11-20. After Natural Science (test's Passage 4), bubble questions 31-40. Stay organized to avoid bubbling errors.

2. Intelligent Guessing and Answer Elimination
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Since the ACT has no guessing penalty, every question should have an answer bubbled. Strategic guessing and elimination techniques maximize your score on questions where you're uncertain or running out of time.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Tip #3: Never Leave Questions Blank—Always Guess
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
The ACT <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">does not penalize wrong answers</strong>—your score is based solely on correct answers. This means random guessing has positive expected value: with four answer choices, random guessing gives you a 25% chance of being correct. On 10 random guesses, you'd expect to get 2-3 correct by pure chance. The implication: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">never leave a question blank</strong>. Even if you have no time to read a passage or question, bubble an answer. Strategy for time crunches: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">If you have 1 minute left and 5 questions unanswered</strong>, you don't have time to consider each one thoughtfully. Instead: immediately bubble the same letter (say, C) for all remaining questions, giving you ~2-3 correct by chance. Then use your remaining minute to quickly scan questions and improve any guesses where you can rapidly identify a better answer. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Develop a default guess letter</strong>—some students always guess C, others always guess H (on odd-numbered questions, where C appears as the third option). The specific letter doesn't matter; having a default prevents decision paralysis and ensures you always bubble something. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Fill in your guesses early</strong>—if you're uncertain about a question, bubble your best guess immediately, mark it for review, and move on. This ensures it gets answered even if you run out of time before returning to it.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Tip #4: Use Process of Elimination to Improve Guessing Odds
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Educated guessing</strong> dramatically improves your odds beyond random 25% chance. If you can eliminate even one definitely wrong answer, your odds improve to 33% (1 in 3). Eliminate two wrong answers, and you have 50% odds—the same as a coin flip. Elimination strategies: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Eliminate extreme answers</strong>—answers using "always," "never," "all," "none," "only," "completely" are often wrong unless the passage makes such absolute claims. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Eliminate answers contradicting the passage</strong>—if you remember the passage generally, you can often identify answers that clearly contradict what it said, even if you don't remember specific details. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Eliminate out-of-scope answers</strong>—answers discussing topics you don't remember the passage mentioning are likely wrong. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Eliminate based on tone</strong>—if the passage was positive, eliminate negative answers; if it was neutral/academic, eliminate emotionally extreme answers. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Look for killing words</strong>—single words that make an answer wrong (changing "some" to "all," "suggested" to "proved"). The process: physically cross out eliminated answers in your test booklet. This makes it easier to choose among remaining options and prevents you from reconsidering clearly wrong answers. Even eliminating one answer improves your guessing odds significantly: over 10 questions, improving from 25% to 33% odds increases expected correct answers from 2.5 to 3.3—nearly a full point improvement.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Recognizing "Too Good to Be True" Wrong Answers
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Some wrong answers are designed to look obviously correct by <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">using passage vocabulary or addressing the question's topic directly</strong>, but they subtly distort the passage's meaning. These "too good to be true" answers are traps for students who select based on familiarity rather than accuracy. Red flags: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Answers that perfectly match the question using exact passage words</strong>—correct answers usually paraphrase rather than quote directly. Direct matches may be traps using familiar vocabulary incorrectly. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Answers that seem more complete or detailed than other options</strong>—sometimes the trap answer provides extensive detail to seem authoritative, but includes subtle errors. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">The first answer that makes you think "Yes, that's it!"</strong>—immediate certainty can indicate a trap designed to attract careless readers. When an answer seems too perfect: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Verify each component against the passage</strong>—just because an answer looks good doesn't mean it's right. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Compare it to other options</strong>—is there a simpler, more straightforward answer that also works? <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check for subtle distortions</strong>—does it use passage vocabulary but change meanings, qualifiers, or relationships? Remember: if an answer seems designed to catch your eye, it might be designed to catch you incorrectly.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Statistical Answer Pattern Awareness
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
While ACT answer distributions aren't perfectly predictable, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">understanding general patterns</strong> can inform strategic guessing. General patterns: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Answers are roughly evenly distributed</strong>—over the 40 Reading questions, you'd expect approximately 10 A's, 10 B's, 10 C's, and 10 D's, with some variance (8-12 of each letter is normal). <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Long runs of the same letter are rare</strong>—getting the same answer letter 4-5 times in a row is unusual (though not impossible). If you've bubbled CCCC, verify your answers but don't automatically change them just because of the pattern. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Correct answers appear in all positions</strong>—no letter is systematically favored as correct. How to use this: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">If you must guess randomly on several questions and notice you haven't selected many D's yet, lean toward D for random guesses</strong>—this balances your distribution. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Don't change confident answers just to balance distribution</strong>—these patterns help inform pure guesses, not verified answers. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">If you've selected the same letter 4+ times consecutively and are uncertain about some, double-check those middle answers</strong>—one might be wrong. Use pattern awareness as a tiebreaker or check, not as a primary decision tool.
</p>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #3b82f6; padding: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Strategic Elimination and Guessing</strong><br><br>
<strong>Situation:</strong> Question asks about the author's attitude toward a new technology. You didn't understand this section well.<br><br>
<strong>Answer choices:</strong><br>
A. "The author believes the technology will completely eliminate all previous methods"<br>
B. "The author views the technology with cautious optimism about its potential benefits"<br>
C. "The author strongly condemns the technology as dangerous and ill-conceived"<br>
D. "The author suggests the technology offers some advantages while acknowledging limitations"<br><br>
<strong>Elimination process:</strong><br>
A: Eliminate—"completely eliminate all" is extreme language; passages rarely make such absolute claims<br>
C: Eliminate—"strongly condemns" is extreme; you don't remember the passage being harshly negative<br><br>
<strong>Remaining: B and D</strong> (50% odds now, vs. 25% random)<br><br>
<strong>Further analysis:</strong> Both are moderate, qualified answers. B emphasizes optimism, D emphasizes balanced view. ACT typically favors balanced complexity over simple optimism.<br><br>
<strong>Educated guess: D</strong> (this type of nuanced, both-sides answer is frequently correct on ACT)<br><br>
<strong>Result:</strong> By eliminating two and using test patterns, improved odds from 25% to ~60-70% (better than 50% coin flip because of pattern awareness).

3. Mental Preparation and Focus Maintenance
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Reading comprehension performance depends heavily on mental state. Managing energy, maintaining focus, and staying composed under pressure can improve your score as much as content knowledge.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Tip #5: Build Mental Stamina Through Timed Practice
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
The ACT Reading section is a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">35-minute mental endurance test</strong>. Reading comprehension quality naturally degrades with fatigue—your ability to maintain focus, retain information, and analyze answers diminishes as you tire. Combat this by building stamina: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Complete full 35-minute Reading sections regularly</strong>, not just individual passages. The difficulty of maintaining concentration for 35 minutes straight is qualitatively different from doing passages individually with breaks between. Practice under test conditions: timed, no breaks, simulating test-day pressure. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Practice full-length tests</strong>—taking complete ACT tests (all four sections) conditions you to maintain Reading performance as the third section when you're already fatigued from English and Math. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Gradually increase difficulty</strong>—start with untimed practice to build skills, then add time constraints, then full-section timing, then full-test conditions. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Track your energy curve</strong>—notice whether you perform better on early or late passages, whether your accuracy declines toward the end, and whether time pressure causes errors. Understanding your personal stamina pattern allows you to compensate: if you fade late, do your strongest passage third instead of last; if time pressure causes rushing, build buffer time into your pacing.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Tip #6: Use Micro-Breaks to Maintain Focus
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Even within the 35-minute section, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">strategic micro-breaks</strong> can restore focus and improve comprehension. These aren't extended breaks—just 2-5 second pauses that give your brain momentary rest. When to use micro-breaks: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Between passages</strong>—after completing one passage and before starting the next, close your eyes, take one deep breath, and clear your mind. This 3-second reset prevents mental fatigue from accumulating. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">When you notice mind-wandering</strong>—if you realize you've read a paragraph without absorbing it, stop immediately, close your eyes for 2 seconds, take a breath, then reread that paragraph with fresh attention. Continuing to read while unfocused wastes more time than a quick reset. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">After difficult questions</strong>—if you just spent 90 seconds on a challenging inference question, take 3 seconds to breathe before moving to the next question. This prevents mental fatigue from the difficult question from degrading your performance on subsequent easier questions. Technique: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Close your eyes</strong> (blocking visual input), <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">take one slow, deep breath</strong> (increasing oxygen to brain), <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">mentally reset</strong> ("I'm starting fresh on this passage/question"). Total time: 2-5 seconds. Over four passages, these breaks cost 10-15 seconds total but can improve accuracy enough to be worth far more than the time spent.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Managing Test Anxiety and Pressure
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Anxiety impairs reading comprehension</strong> by consuming working memory with worry instead of text processing. Anxiety management strategies: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Reframe pressure as excitement</strong>—research shows that telling yourself "I'm excited" instead of "I'm nervous" improves performance because both emotions have similar physiological responses but different mental impacts. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Use confidence anchors</strong>—remind yourself of successful practice test performances or passages you've mastered. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Accept that difficulty is normal</strong>—if a passage seems hard, recognize that it's probably hard for everyone, not just you. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Focus on process, not outcomes</strong>—instead of thinking "I need to get all these right," think "I'm going to read carefully and work systematically." Process focus keeps you in the present rather than worrying about scores. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Have a reset routine</strong>—if you feel panic rising, use your micro-break technique: close eyes, breathe, refocus. The physical act of closing eyes and breathing deeply activates your parasympathetic nervous system, countering stress response. Practice these techniques in low-stakes situations so they're automatic on test day.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Pre-Test and Test-Day Preparation
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Mental performance doesn't begin when you open the test booklet—it's influenced by <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">preparation in the hours and days before</strong>. Optimize your preparation: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Get adequate sleep</strong>—aim for 7-9 hours the night before. Sleep deprivation significantly impairs reading comprehension, working memory, and decision-making. Don't sacrifice sleep for last-minute cramming; rest provides more benefit than additional study. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Eat a balanced meal 1-2 hours before</strong>—include protein and complex carbohydrates for sustained energy. Avoid excessive sugar that causes energy crashes. Stay hydrated. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Do a light warm-up</strong>—the morning of the test, read something engaging (news article, short story) for 10-15 minutes to activate your reading comprehension mode before the test. This is like stretching before athletics. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Avoid cramming new material on test day</strong>—review familiar strategies and concepts if desired, but don't learn new approaches that might confuse your established methods. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Arrive early</strong>—rushing creates anxiety. Arriving 15-20 minutes early lets you settle in calmly. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Have a pre-test routine</strong>—some students listen to specific music, others do breathing exercises, others visualize success.

<strong>1 Week Before:</strong><br>
- Light practice only (1 passage per day) to stay sharp without burning out<br>
- Review strategies and common mistakes<br>
- Ensure sleep schedule is stable<br><br>
<strong>Day Before:</strong><br>
- No ACT practice<br>
- Light reading for enjoyment (30 min)<br>
- Prepare materials (admission ticket, ID, calculator, snacks)<br>
- Go to bed early (8-9 hours sleep)<br><br>
<strong>Test Morning:</strong><br>
- Balanced breakfast<br>
- 10-15 min reading warm-up (news article)<br>

4. Review, Verification, and Score Optimization
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
The final minutes of the Reading section and your approach to reviewing answers can make the difference between a good score and a great score. Strategic review maximizes the value of any remaining time.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Tip #7: Use Remaining Time Strategically for Review
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
If you finish all questions with time remaining, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">strategic review</strong> can catch errors and improve your score. With 2-5 minutes remaining: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">First priority: Return to questions you marked as uncertain</strong>—these are questions you answered but weren't confident about. With fresh eyes and no time pressure, you may see the correct answer more clearly. Review your reasoning, check if you can eliminate additional wrong answers, and verify your selection. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Second priority: Double-check main idea questions</strong>—these high-value questions impact your understanding of other questions. Verify that your main idea answer accurately captures the passage's primary focus. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Third priority: Verify any questions where you changed your answer</strong>—studies show that students often change correct answers to incorrect ones. If you changed an answer, verify you had concrete reasons (new evidence, caught an error) rather than vague doubt. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Don't randomly review all questions</strong>—with limited time, random review wastes time on questions you answered confidently. Focus review where it's most likely to improve your score: uncertain questions and high-impact questions.

The "Trust Your First Instinct" Debate
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Common advice says <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"trust your first instinct and don't change answers."</strong> Research shows this is partially true but requires nuance: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">When to trust your first instinct</strong>—if you're changing an answer based on vague unease, anxiety, or second-guessing without concrete new reasoning, your first answer is usually correct. Pattern recognition and intuition developed through practice are often reliable. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">When to change your answer</strong>—if you: reread the question and realize you misunderstood what it was asking, locate passage evidence that clearly contradicts your initial answer, identify a reasoning error in your initial logic, or notice that another answer is more complete or precise. These concrete reasons justify changes. The key distinction: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Change answers when you have evidence-based reasons; don't change based on anxiety or overthinking.</strong> In practice, track your answer changes: Did changes improve or hurt your score? This personal data shows whether you tend to make good changes (trust your reconsiderations) or bad changes (stick with first instincts more). Most students hurt themselves by changing without good reason, but some students actually catch and fix errors effectively. Know which type you are.

Avoiding Bubbling Errors
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
One of the most frustrating ways to lose points is through <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">bubbling errors</strong>—marking the wrong answer circle or getting off-track in numbering. Prevention strategies: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Bubble in groups</strong>—rather than switching between test booklet and answer sheet for each question, answer 3-5 questions in your booklet, then transfer all answers to the sheet at once. This reduces task-switching and keeps you focused on comprehension. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Mark clearly in booklet</strong>—circle or mark your chosen answers clearly in the test booklet so you can easily see what to transfer. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Verify question numbers</strong>—every time you transfer answers, verify the question numbers match. If you're bubbling questions 21-23, check that the numbers in your booklet match the numbers on your sheet. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Be especially careful when skipping questions</strong>—if you skip question 25, make sure you don't accidentally bubble question 26's answer in the 25 circle. Some students leave blank circles, others mark skipped questions with a light pencil dot to maintain numbering. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Do a final number check</strong>—in the last 30 seconds, quickly verify that question 40's answer is in circle 40, questions aren't double-bubbled, and all questions have answers. These checks take seconds but prevent devastating errors.

Learning from Practice Tests
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Your practice test performance provides <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">invaluable data for score optimization</strong>. After each practice test: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Analyze every error</strong>—don't just note the right answer; understand why you chose wrong and what you missed. Categories include: misread question, misread passage, fell for trap answer, time pressure rushing, careless error, knowledge gap. Different error types require different corrections. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Track patterns</strong>—do you consistently miss certain question types? Certain passage types? Do you perform worse early or late in the section? Does time pressure affect you? Pattern identification reveals where to focus improvement efforts. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Test strategy variations</strong>—try different approaches (passage order, question-first vs. passage-first, different timing allocations) and compare results. Let data, not assumptions, guide your strategies. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Simulate test conditions</strong>—practice tests should match real test conditions: timed, no breaks, full sections, proper environment. Unrealistic practice produces unrealistic results. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Review correctly answered questions too</strong>—occasionally review questions you got right to reinforce effective strategies and ensure you got them right for the right reasons, not lucky guessing. Practice tests are learning opportunities, not just score predictors. Analyze them deeply to continuously refine your approach.

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Strategic Review Process</strong><br><br>
<strong>Situation:</strong> Finished all 40 questions with 3 minutes remaining<br><br>
<strong>Review priorities:</strong><br><br>
<strong>Minute 1 (High-priority uncertain questions):</strong><br>
- Return to Q15 (marked uncertain)—reread passage lines, eliminate A and C, choose between B and D. Select D with better confidence.<br>
- Return to Q28 (marked uncertain)—verify against passage, confirm original answer C was correct.<br><br>
<strong>Minute 2 (Main idea verification):</strong><br>
- Review Q1 (Passage 1 main idea)—verify answer captures full scope. Looks good.<br>
- Review Q11 (Passage 2 main idea)—verify. Looks good.<br>
- Review Q21 (Passage 3 main idea)—realize you may have focused too narrowly. Change from A to C after verifying C better captures overall passage.<br><br>
<strong>Minute 3 (Final checks):</strong><br>
- Quick scan of answer sheet—verify question 40 is filled in circle 40, no double bubbles, no blanks.<br>
- Check questions where you changed answers (Q7 and Q18)—verify changes had good reasons. Yes, caught errors.<br><br>
<strong>Result:</strong> 3-minute review caught and fixed 2 errors (Q15 and Q21), confirmed you correctly fixed 2 others (Q7 and Q18), and verified no bubbling errors. Net improvement: +2 points, potentially the difference between a 30 and 32.
