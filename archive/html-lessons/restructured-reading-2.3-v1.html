1. When to Read the Answer Choices
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">After reading the question, you can either read the answer choices right away or go back to the passage first
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The answer depends on the question type, your reading comprehension skills, and your recall of the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">There is no 100% right or wrong time to read the answer choices—it's about finding what works for you</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Try different methods on practice passages and practice tests to discover your optimal approach</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Strategy 1: Read Answer Choices Right Away for "Which of the Following" Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For "which of the following" questions, always read the answer choices before going to the passage
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Without reading the answer choices, it's impossible to know what you're looking for</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Which of the following best describes the author's view of Grier's theory?"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The question is too broad without seeing the four specific options</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Knowing the 4 options makes it easier to find the correct answer and usually saves time</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Strategy 2: Come Up With Your Own Answer First for Purpose Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For purpose questions, go back to the passage first and come up with your own answer
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Read for context and determine WHY the information is included</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Once you have your answer, look at the answer choices to see which one matches your reasoning</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If none match, you may have misunderstood—reread with the answer choices in mind</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Strategy 3: Try Your Own Answer First for Broad Passage Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">After reading the entire passage and answering all other questions, come up with your own answer
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You'll understand the passage well by this point, so you can answer questions about the passage as a whole</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Once you have your answer, look at the choices to see which one matches</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you found the passage difficult and can't come up with your own answer, read the choices right away</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Knowing the 4 options can make it easier to find the answer or eliminate incorrect choices</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Strategy 4: Try Both Methods for Clear Evidence and Inference Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Method #1: Read answer choices right away</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You know the 4 options before going back to the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">As you read, you may recognize evidence that matches an answer choice you just read</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Helps you recognize the correct answer more quickly and can save time if you remember the answer</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">WARNING: This doesn't work if reading the choices distracts you from knowing EXACTLY what the question asks</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Some students reread the question after reading all 4 choices to ensure they know what they're looking for</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Method #2: Go back to the passage first</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If reading answer choices distracts you, go to the passage first and look for evidence</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Clear evidence and inference questions are usually specific, so you'll know where to read</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">By reading before looking at choices, you're 100% focused on answering the question</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Once you find potential evidence, read the answer choices and eliminate incorrect ones</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you can't find evidence in 20-30 seconds, read the answer choices—they may trigger your memory</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Strategy 5: Read Answer Choices When You Don't Have Primary Keywords
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For vague questions without primary keywords, read the answer choices right away
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The answer choices may help identify where to go or trigger your memory</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "How did the narrator's personality affect her research?" has no clear keywords to skim for</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Reading the 4 options makes it easier to eliminate incorrect choices and know what to look for</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Strategy 6: Use Answer Choices to Help on Difficult Passages
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For passages you have trouble understanding, read the answer choices more quickly
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you read a passage and don't understand what's going on, let the answer choices help you</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For any questions in a difficult passage, read the answer choices right away</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: If asked about a paragraph's main idea but you don't understand it, read the 4 options then reread the paragraph</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Knowing the 4 options may help you recognize what the paragraph is saying</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The more you use the answer choices to help, the more you'll understand and answer correctly</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. How to Read Answer Choices Most Effectively
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The recommended approach: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Work both forwards and backwards simultaneously</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Working forwards = looking for evidence in the passage that matches the correct answer</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Working backwards = eliminating incorrect answer choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">In an ideal world, you'd find Waldo every time by working forwards, but that's difficult</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For some questions, it's easier to eliminate three incorrect answers than find evidence for the correct one</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you can eliminate 3 answer choices as incorrect, you've found the correct answer—even without evidence</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Working Forwards — Look for Evidence in the Passage
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Put your finger on the evidence (the Waldo!) and match it to the correct answer choice
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This is the ideal approach when you can clearly identify the supporting evidence</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Finding evidence that supports the correct answer for every question is difficult</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Don't rely solely on working forwards—combine it with working backwards</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Working Backwards — Eliminate Incorrect Answer Choices
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Anytime you see an answer choice that is incorrect for any reason, cross it off
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You'll learn the 5 types of incorrect answer choices in Chapter 2.4</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For some questions, eliminating three incorrect choices is easier than finding the evidence</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Even without finding evidence in the passage, if you eliminate 3 choices, you've found the correct answer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Working Forwards and Backwards Simultaneously
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">As you read each answer choice, ask yourself two questions:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Question 1 (Working Forwards):</strong> "Is there evidence in the passage that matches what this answer choice says?"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong>Question 2 (Working Backwards):</strong> "Is there any specific detail or strong statement in this answer choice that could make it incorrect?"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Evaluating Answer Choices
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Working forwards requires going back to the passage
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you find Waldo, you'll know the correct answer</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If there's no evidence to support the answer choice, it's incorrect—cross it off</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Working backwards means looking for words that could make the answer incorrect
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Be cautious about specific details or strong statements in answer choices</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Stronger and more specific answer choices are usually incorrect because they can't be supported by the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">More boring answer choices are more commonly correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The ACT knows students prefer to pick specific choices when struggling (easier to justify), so they use this as a trap</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Nobody wants to pick boring answers, but boring is usually better on ACT Reading!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

4. Key Strategy When Stuck Between Two Answers
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">If you're stuck between two answer choices and cannot find evidence to support either one:
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Always pick the less detailed answer choice</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Boring is usually better on the ACT Reading Test</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">More specific answer choices tend to include details that go beyond what the passage supports</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">More general (boring) answer choices are safer because they're less likely to contradict the passage</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Key Takeaways
</h3>

<ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>When to read answer choices depends on question type: always read them first for "which of the following" questions and questions without clear keywords, but try coming up with your own answer first for purpose and broad passage questions. For clear evidence and inference questions, experiment with both methods to find what works best for you.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Work both forwards and backwards simultaneously—look for evidence in the passage that matches an answer choice (forwards) while also looking for specific details or strong statements that could make a choice incorrect (backwards). For some questions, it's easier to eliminate three incorrect answers than to find evidence for the correct one.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Be cautious of specific details and strong statements in answer choices—stronger and more specific choices are usually incorrect because they can't be supported by the passage. More boring, general answer choices are more commonly correct, even though students tend to prefer specific choices because they're easier to justify when struggling.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>If stuck between two answer choices and you cannot find evidence to support either one, always pick the less detailed (more boring) answer choice. Remember: boring is usually better on the ACT Reading Test because specific answer choices tend to include details that go beyond what the passage actually supports.
