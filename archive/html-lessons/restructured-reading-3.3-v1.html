1. How to Use Practice Passages Effectively
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Complete passages one at a time and review immediately</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Complete these passages 1 at a time and watch the video explanation right after you complete each passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Right after you complete the passage, you'll remember exactly what you were thinking as you answered each question</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">As you watch the video explanation, you can identify exactly what you did correctly, where you made mistakes in your thinking, and how you can improve on the next passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you complete a bunch of passages in a row or watch the video explanation much later, you will not learn as effectively</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Try different approaches to find the one that works for you</strong>
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A variety of approaches were discussed in Chapter 1.3 (now is a good time to review that chapter if you don't remember the details!)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you're not sure what approach is best for you, try different approaches on different passages</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Once you find your favorite approach, stick with that approach for the rest of your practice passages and practice ACTs to perfect it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. First 4 Practice Passages — Focus on Accuracy
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Do not worry about strictly timing the first 4 practice passages
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You have 10 minutes per passage (15 minutes with extended time), but you can take more time on these passages</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Your goal on these passages is to try your best to answer all the questions correctly</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Focus on applying what you've learned</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you need to take a bit more time to do so at first, that's fine! Don't worry about pacing yet</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You will learn to work more quickly as you improve your Reading skills</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Last 4 Practice Passages — Add Timing
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Set a timer for the last 4 practice passages and work on your pacing skills
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Try to apply the pacing skills discussed in Chapter 1.4 and the time management tips from Chapter 3.2</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Set a timer according to the times below:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Regular Time = 10 minutes</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Extended Time = 15 minutes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
What to Do If You Don't Finish in Time
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Do your best to complete the passage in time
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you don't finish in time, complete the rest of the questions for practice</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Think about how you could have better managed your time</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Make notes of what you can do to improve on the next passage</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Learn from Your Mistakes
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Review any topic(s) that you need to before going to the next practice passage
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Students who improve the most are the ones who are the most obsessive about learning from their mistakes</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">After each passage, try to identify why you missed the questions that you answered incorrectly</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If there are any topics from the course that you need to review, go back and review before working on the next practice passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For example, if you notice you're struggling on spotting the different question types, go back to Chapter 2.1</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This course has covered tons of information in a short period of time, so a quick review can be effective to help you continue to improve</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
5. Be Patient!
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">ACT Reading is a very difficult section for some students, and it's easy to get discouraged if you're missing a lot of questions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Do your best and use the video explanations to learn how to improve your skills</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You will not immediately start answering all questions correctly</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It's a journey to get to the score you want</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Your goal is to get a little bit better with each passage</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">

    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Complete practice passages one at a time and watch video explanations immediately after each passage while you still remember your thinking.

  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>For the first 4 practice passages, don't worry about timing—take extra time if needed and focus on accuracy and applying what you've learned. For the last 4 practice passages, set a timer (10 minutes regular time, 15 minutes extended time) and work on pacing skills. If you don't finish in time, complete the rest for practice and think about how to better manage time on the next passage.
