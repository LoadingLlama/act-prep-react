Developing an efficient <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">passage navigation strategy</strong> is crucial for success on the ACT Science section, where you must balance <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">reading comprehension</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">data analysis</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">time management</strong>, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">question-answering efficiency</strong>. Unlike the Reading section where you must engage deeply with narrative or expository text, Science passages require a different approach that prioritizes visual data interpretation over linear reading. This lesson provides a comprehensive framework for approaching Science passages strategically, explains the optimal order for processing information, introduces techniques for efficient figure analysis, and teaches you how to extract maximum value from minimal reading.

1. The Optimal Passage Reading Sequence
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
The most efficient approach to Science passages follows a specific <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">strategic sequence</strong> rather than simply reading from top to bottom. Understanding this sequence and practicing it consistently will help you work faster while maintaining high accuracy, allowing you to complete all passages within the 35-minute time limit.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Step 1: Read the Introduction Quickly
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Begin by reading the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">introductory paragraph</strong> or first few sentences to understand <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">what is being studied</strong> and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">why</strong>. This gives you essential context about the scientific phenomenon, question, or hypothesis being investigated. For example, an introduction might explain that scientists are studying how temperature affects the rate of a chemical reaction, or that researchers are investigating factors that influence bird migration patterns. This context helps you understand what the variables in subsequent figures represent and why certain measurements were taken. However, don't spend more than 15-20 seconds on this initial reading—you just need the general topic and purpose, not detailed understanding. If the introduction contains complex terminology or detailed background, don't worry about understanding every word. Focus on grasping the big picture: What phenomenon or question is being studied?
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Step 2: Examine All Figures and Tables First
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
After the introduction, go directly to the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">figures and tables</strong>—this is where most of the important information lives. For each figure, identify: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">what variables</strong> are being shown (read axis labels and column headers carefully), (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">what units</strong> are used (meters, grams, seconds, degrees Celsius, etc.), (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">what general trends</strong> are visible (do values increase, decrease, stay constant, or show a pattern?), and (4) what <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">different lines, symbols, or categories</strong> represent (check the legend or key). Don't try to memorize specific data points—you can return to find those when answering questions. Instead, develop a general understanding of what each figure shows and what relationships exist between variables. This figure-first approach is efficient because 60-70% of Science questions require you to reference figures directly, and understanding the data helps you answer questions even without reading all the text.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Step 3: Skim Experimental Procedures and Descriptions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
After examining the figures, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">skim</strong> any paragraphs that describe experimental procedures, setups, or methods. Your goal is to understand <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">how trials differ from each other</strong> and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">what variables were manipulated</strong>, but you don't need to memorize step-by-step procedures. For example, if an experiment has three trials, note what changed between Trial 1, Trial 2, and Trial 3 (was it temperature? concentration? time?). This understanding helps you interpret results and answer questions about experimental design. However, avoid reading detailed procedural descriptions word-for-word unless a question specifically asks about them. Paragraphs explaining how equipment was set up, how measurements were taken, or what specific materials were used often contain more detail than necessary for most questions. You can always return to read these sections carefully if a question requires that information.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Step 4: Move to Questions and Reference Back as Needed
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Once you've completed your initial passage review (introduction + figures + skim of procedures), move directly to the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">questions</strong>. For each question, identify what information is being asked for, then <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">reference back to the specific figure, table, or text</strong> that contains the answer. Don't try to answer questions from memory—even if you think you remember the data, check the passage to confirm. This approach prevents careless errors and is actually faster than trying to memorize all details upfront. Many questions will direct you to specific figures (e.g., "According to Figure 2..."), making it easy to know where to look. For questions without explicit references, use the question number as a guide—early questions typically relate to early parts of the passage, while later questions often address later sections. This question-focused approach ensures you're spending time on information that actually matters for points rather than reading details that won't be tested.

<strong>Example: Optimal Reading Sequence in Action</strong><br><br>
<strong>Passage Preview:</strong> A Research Summaries passage with 3 experiments testing how pH, temperature, and concentration affect enzyme activity.<br><br>
<strong>Step 1 (20 seconds):</strong> Read intro → "Scientists studied factors affecting enzyme activity"<br>
<strong>Step 2 (45 seconds):</strong> Examine all three figures → Note that Figure 1 shows pH vs. activity, Figure 2 shows temperature vs. activity, Figure 3 shows concentration vs. activity<br>
<strong>Step 3 (30 seconds):</strong> Skim experiment descriptions → Trial 1 varied pH, Trial 2 varied temperature, Trial 3 varied concentration<br>
<strong>Step 4 (3-4 minutes):</strong> Answer all 6 questions, referencing specific figures and text as needed<br><br>
Total time: approximately 5 minutes per passage

2. Figure-First vs. Text-First Reading Approaches
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
One of the most important strategic decisions you'll make is whether to adopt a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">figure-first approach</strong> or a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">text-first approach</strong>. While most high-scoring students favor the figure-first method, understanding both approaches and their variations helps you identify what works best for your learning style and adapt to different passage types.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
The Figure-First Approach (Recommended for Most Students)
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">figure-first approach</strong> prioritizes examining graphs, tables, and diagrams before reading detailed text. This method works well because Science questions primarily test data interpretation skills, and most answers can be found by analyzing figures. After a brief intro reading, you spend the majority of your initial passage time studying figures to understand what variables are present, what trends exist, and how different trials or conditions compare. Then you skim text only as needed to clarify what the figures show or to understand experimental differences. This approach is particularly effective for <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Data Representation passages</strong> where figures dominate and text is minimal, but it also works well for many Research Summaries passages. The main advantage is <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">time efficiency</strong>—you focus on the information that matters most. The potential disadvantage is that you might miss important context or definitions that would make figure interpretation easier, though this is rare since figures are usually self-explanatory with proper labels.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
The Text-First Approach (Better for Some Conflicting Viewpoints Passages)
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">text-first approach</strong> involves reading the passage more thoroughly before examining figures in depth. This method can be effective for <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Conflicting Viewpoints passages</strong>, which contain substantial text describing different scientific perspectives and may have fewer or simpler figures. When different scientists or students present competing theories, understanding the logic and evidence behind each viewpoint often requires careful reading of the arguments presented. In these cases, reading the text first provides context that makes subsequent figure analysis more meaningful. However, even with this approach, you should still <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">skim rather than read every word</strong>, focusing on understanding the main claims and differences between viewpoints. The main disadvantage of text-first for Data Representation and Research Summaries passages is that it often wastes time on details that won't be tested, causing you to run short on time for later passages.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
The Hybrid Approach (Questions-First Method)
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Some students prefer a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">hybrid approach</strong> where they quickly preview the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">questions first</strong> to know what information they'll need, then strategically read only the relevant parts of the passage. For example, if you see that questions 1-3 all reference Figure 1, you might examine Figure 1 carefully while only glancing at Figures 2 and 3. Or if a question asks specifically about what was held constant in Trial 2, you know to focus on that experimental description. This approach can be highly efficient because it ensures you're never reading irrelevant information. However, it requires strong mental organization to track what you've looked for and what you still need to find. It can also be disruptive if you're constantly jumping between questions and passage sections. This method works best for students who are comfortable with non-linear reading and have already developed strong figure-reading skills through practice.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Adapting Your Approach by Passage Type
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
The most effective strategy is often to <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">adapt your approach</strong> based on passage type and complexity. For straightforward <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Data Representation passages</strong> with simple graphs and minimal text, a strict figure-first approach usually works best. For <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Research Summaries passages</strong> with multiple experiments, you might spend more time reading experimental descriptions to understand how trials differ, though you should still prioritize figures. For <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Conflicting Viewpoints passages</strong>, you may need to read the text more carefully to understand each scientist's reasoning, though you should still examine any accompanying figures. Some students also adjust their strategy based on passage difficulty—spending more time on initial reading for complex passages and less for straightforward ones. Flexibility is valuable, but make sure you're making conscious strategic decisions rather than just reading randomly or inconsistently.

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Choosing Your Approach</strong><br><br>
<strong>Data Representation Passage:</strong> 3 figures showing temperature vs. pressure relationships → Use figure-first approach, spend 60+ seconds examining graphs, minimal text reading<br><br>
<strong>Research Summaries Passage:</strong> 3 experiments with detailed procedures and result tables → Use figure-first but allocate more time to skimming experimental descriptions<br><br>
<strong>Conflicting Viewpoints Passage:</strong> Scientists A and B debate climate change mechanisms → Read text more thoroughly to understand each perspective, but still check figures for supporting evidence<br><br>
Experiment with different approaches during practice to find what maximizes your accuracy and speed.

3. Efficient Figure and Table Analysis Techniques
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Since figures and tables contain the majority of information needed to answer Science questions, developing <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">systematic figure analysis skills</strong> is essential. Learning to extract key information quickly and accurately from visual data representations will dramatically improve both your speed and accuracy on the Science section.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
The Five-Element Figure Analysis Framework
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
When you look at any figure, systematically check five elements: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Variables</strong> - What is being measured or manipulated? Read all axis labels and table headers. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Units</strong> - What units are used for each variable? (meters, grams, seconds, etc.) Pay attention to unit prefixes like "k" for kilo or "m" for milli. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Scale</strong> - What range of values is shown? Does the axis start at zero or some other value? Is the scale linear or logarithmic? (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Trends</strong> - How do the variables relate to each other? Do values increase together (positive correlation), move in opposite directions (inverse relationship), or show no clear pattern? (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Legend/Key</strong> - What do different lines, symbols, colors, or categories represent? Making this five-element check habitual ensures you never miss important details that could cause errors.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Common Figure Types and How to Read Them
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
ACT Science passages use several standard figure types, each requiring slightly different reading strategies. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Line graphs</strong> show how one variable changes with another; focus on the overall trend (increasing, decreasing, constant) and whether the relationship is linear or curved. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Bar graphs</strong> compare values across categories; look for which category has the highest or lowest value and how much they differ. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Scatter plots</strong> show relationships between two variables with individual data points; look for general patterns or clusters. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Data tables</strong> organize values in rows and columns; identify what each row and column represents and notice patterns as you move across rows or down columns. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Diagrams</strong> illustrate experimental setups or scientific processes; understand what each labeled component represents and how they interact. Recognizing these common types helps you quickly orient yourself and know what to look for.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Identifying Trends and Relationships
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Many Science questions ask about <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">trends and relationships</strong> between variables. When examining figures, actively ask yourself: How do the variables relate? Common relationship types include: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">positive/direct relationship</strong> (both variables increase together), <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">negative/inverse relationship</strong> (one increases while the other decreases), <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">no relationship</strong> (changes in one variable don't affect the other), <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">linear relationship</strong> (the relationship forms a straight line), <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">non-linear relationship</strong> (the relationship is curved), and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">exponential relationship</strong> (the rate of change accelerates). Being able to quickly identify these relationship types allows you to answer trend questions without needing to read specific values. You should also notice whether trends are <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">consistent</strong> across the entire range shown or whether the relationship <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">changes</strong> at certain points.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Avoiding Common Figure-Reading Mistakes
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Several common errors can lead to wrong answers even when you understand the science conceptually. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Confusing x and y variables</strong> is extremely common—always check which variable is on which axis. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Misreading scales</strong> causes many errors, especially when axes don't start at zero or use non-standard intervals (like going 0, 50, 100, 200, 500 instead of evenly spaced values). <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Ignoring units</strong> can lead to errors when comparing values from different figures or when units change within a passage. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Misidentifying which line or symbol</strong> represents which condition is another frequent mistake—always double-check the legend. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Extrapolating too far beyond the data</strong> shown can also cause errors—be cautious when predicting values outside the measured range. Slowing down for just 2-3 extra seconds to verify these details prevents careless mistakes that cost points.
</p>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #3b82f6; padding: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Systematic Figure Analysis</strong><br><br>
<strong>Figure 1: Graph showing "Temperature (°C)" on x-axis and "Reaction Rate (mol/sec)" on y-axis</strong><br><br>
<strong>Variables:</strong> Temperature and Reaction Rate<br>
<strong>Units:</strong> Temperature in °C, Reaction Rate in mol/sec<br>
<strong>Scale:</strong> x-axis goes from 0-80°C in intervals of 20; y-axis goes from 0-5 mol/sec in intervals of 1<br>
<strong>Trend:</strong> As temperature increases, reaction rate increases (positive relationship, appears to be exponential)<br>
<strong>Legend:</strong> One line shown, labeled "Enzyme A"<br><br>
This 15-second analysis prepares you to answer most questions about this figure without needing to re-examine it repeatedly.

4. Maximizing Efficiency Through Strategic Passage Selection
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Not all Science passages are equally difficult, and you don't have to complete them in the order they appear. Strategic passage selection—choosing which passages to tackle first based on your strengths and passage characteristics—can significantly improve your score by ensuring you <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">maximize points earned</strong> within the time limit and maintain <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">confidence and momentum</strong> throughout the section.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Identifying Your Strongest Passage Types
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Through practice, you should identify which passage types you find easiest and most time-efficient. Many students find <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Data Representation passages</strong> quickest because they have minimal text and straightforward graph-reading questions. Others prefer <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Research Summaries passages</strong> because they enjoy the logical structure of experimental design. Some students find <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Conflicting Viewpoints passages</strong> most accessible because they involve reading comprehension skills similar to the Reading section. Understanding your preferences allows you to develop a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">personalized passage order strategy</strong>. For example, if you're strongest at Data Representation, you might quickly flip through the section at the start, identify the 2-3 Data Representation passages by their figure-heavy layouts, and complete those first. This approach ensures you secure easy points quickly and build confidence before tackling more challenging passages.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Quick Passage Previewing Technique
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
At the start of the Science section, consider spending 30-45 seconds doing a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">quick preview</strong> of all passages to identify which look most straightforward. Flip through and quickly assess: (1) How many figures does each passage have? Passages with more complex or dense figures may take longer. (2) How much text is present? Text-heavy passages (usually Conflicting Viewpoints) may require more reading time. (3) Do any passages cover topics you're familiar with? While outside knowledge isn't required, comfort with a topic can boost confidence. (4) Are there any passages with particularly simple-looking graphs or tables? These might be quick wins. Based on this preview, mentally rank the passages from most to least approachable and tackle them in that order. However, be careful not to spend too much time previewing—if this takes more than 45 seconds, it's probably not worth it. Some students prefer to just start with the first passage rather than risk wasting time on decision-making.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Banking Time with Faster Passages
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
The strategy of completing easier passages first has another advantage: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">banking time</strong> for more difficult passages. If you can complete a straightforward Data Representation passage in 3.5 minutes instead of 5 minutes, you've saved 1.5 minutes that you can apply to a more complex Research Summaries or Conflicting Viewpoints passage later. This flexibility is crucial because some passages genuinely do take longer than others due to complexity, and rigid pacing (exactly 5 minutes per passage) doesn't account for this variability. By working efficiently on easier passages, you create a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">time buffer</strong> that reduces stress and allows you to think more carefully about challenging questions. However, don't rush through easier passages so quickly that you make careless errors—the time you save isn't worth it if you miss questions you should have gotten right. Aim for efficient accuracy, not just speed.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Managing Difficult Passages Strategically
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
When you encounter a particularly challenging passage—whether due to complex figures, unfamiliar terminology, or confusing experimental design—have a strategy for managing it without letting it derail your entire section. First, recognize that <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">not all questions within a passage are equally difficult</strong>. Even in a challenging passage, there are usually 2-3 straightforward questions that ask for simple data reading or basic trends. Tackle those first to secure easy points. For genuinely difficult questions that would require extensive time, consider <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">strategic guessing</strong>—if you've spent 60 seconds on a question and still aren't sure, make your best guess and move on rather than spending 2-3 minutes agonizing over one question. You can also employ the strategy of <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">saving one passage for last</strong>—if you reach the final passage with only 3 minutes remaining, answer the easiest questions you can identify and guess on the rest rather than running out of time completely.

<strong>Example: Strategic Passage Selection</strong><br><br>
<strong>Your Science section contains:</strong><br>
- Passage 1: Research Summaries (3 experiments, dense text) - MEDIUM DIFFICULTY<br>
- Passage 2: Data Representation (simple line graphs) - EASY<br>
- Passage 3: Conflicting Viewpoints (lots of text) - HARD<br>
- Passage 4: Data Representation (multiple tables) - EASY<br>
- Passage 5: Research Summaries (2 experiments) - MEDIUM<br>
- Passage 6: Data Representation (scatter plots) - MEDIUM<br><br>
<strong>Optimal order:</strong> 2 → 4 → 6 → 1 → 5 → 3 (easy passages first, hardest last)<br><br>
This ensures you secure maximum points on straightforward passages before tackling the time-consuming Conflicting Viewpoints passage.
