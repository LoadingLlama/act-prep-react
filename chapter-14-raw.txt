Chapter 14: Logarithms
On the ACT, you need to be familiar with how logarithms and natural logarithms work, the basic rules for
logarithms, and how to convert a logarithm to exponential form.

Basics of Logarithms
Let’s begin with the basics of how logarithms work:
log,b= c

is the same as

ac =b

Logarithms are just a different form of exponents. Both equations describe the same relationship between the
values a, b, and c, where a is the base and c is the exponent. To make this a bit easier, let’s use some numbers.

log33 =1

isthesameas

31=3

log,9 =2

isthesameas

37=9

log3;27 =3

isthesameas

3% = 27

The majority of logarithms questions on the ACT ask you to understand how the basics of logarithms work.
To solve, you will almost always switch from logarithmic form to exponential form.
Example 1: When log, x = 3, what is x?
A.

12

B. 48

C. 64

D. 81

Solution: To solve, we need to turn the logarithm into exponential form. The base is 4 and the exponent is 3,
so the exponential form is

x= 4° = 64
The answer is C.

Example 2: What integer does 5(log3 9 + log, 8) equal?
A.

10

B.

15

C. 20

D. 25

Solution: First, let’s find the value of log; 9 by converting the logarithm to exponential form.
log,9=x

isthesameas

3% =9

We know that 3? = 9, so x = 2, which means that log, 9 = 2. We can repeat this for log, 8.
log,8=x

isthesameas

2% =8

We know that 2? = 8, so x = 3, which means that log, 8 = 3.
Now, we can plug in our values for logs 9 and log, 8 to the equation and solve.

5(log; 9 + log, 8) = 5(2 + 3) = 25
The answer is D.

Shortcut solution — Use Your Calculator: We can solve this entire question using your calculator! To do so,
we will use the logarithm change of base rule.
log,a =

log(a)

~ log(b)

Now that we know the change of base rule, we can use the calculator to solve for log; 9 and log, 8:
_ log(9) _

_ log(8) _

logs 9 = Cea)

log2 8 = Cea)

Chapter 14: Logarithms

To solve, plug in the values to the original equation.

5(log; 9 + log, 8)

= 5(2+ 3) = 25

The answer is D.

Some of you may have the change of base formula in your calculators. For those of you with a TI-83 or TI-84
calculator, you click MATH and then scroll down until you see LOGBASE. Ifyou click on that, your
calculator will show you
log,0

and you can just type in the exact values for any question like example 2. Many other calculators have this
programmed in as well, so you should check if yours does! If not, you can just use the change of base rule we
used above.

Logarithm Rules
You should also know the following basic rules for logarithms. You very rarely need to use these rules to
solve questions on the ACT, but they have appeared on the test before and are fair game to appear again.

Rules

Formulas

Product

log, (xy) = log, x + log, y

Quotient

loga (5) = log, x — logay

Log of a Power

log, x” = ylog,x

Log of 1

log, 1 =0

You will only need to use these rules for questions where the change of base rule is not enough to solve. Most
likely, these will be difficult questions towards the end of the ACT Math Test.

Example 3: If log, 3% = =, what is the value of x?
A=

B3

©. NIN

D. 4

Solution: We can use the log of a power rule to simplify the left side of the equation to get
3
xlogg3 = 5

Next, we can use our change of base equation to solve for log, 3.
log.

3 = log(3) _ 1

O59? = log(9)

2

Now, we can plug in= for log, 3 and solve for x.

The answer is B.

Shortcut Solution — Backsolve: The easiest way to solve this question 1s to backsolve. Plug in the answer

choices for x and use the change of base rule to see which one equals = Try it with your calculator and the
correct answer of x = 3.

Example 4: If log, x = p and log, y = q, then log, = =?
A. p*-@q

B. 2p+q

C. 2p-q

pb.
2
q

Solution: For a question like this, we need to use the logarithm rules. First, we need to use the quotient rule.

log, - = log, x* —log,y
Next, we use the power rule.

log, x* — log, y = 2log, x — log, y
Since log, x = p and log, y = q, we can plug in p and q to solve.

2log,x — log,y = 2p — q
The answer is C.

Questions like example 4 are very rare on the ACT, so this is definitely not a need-to-know topic for all
students. With that being said, any students aiming for a math score of 30 and above should still make sure
that you memorize all of the logarithm rules just in case!

Natural Logarithms
On rare occasions, the ACT may also ask you questions with natural logarithms. Natural logarithm
questions are very uncommon, so this is a topic that anyone rushing through this book can skip. Any

natural logarithms questions are almost guaranteed to appear in the difficult questions at the end of the math
test.

The same rules that we have covered so far in this chapter all apply for natural logarithms, except than

the base is always “e,” which is an irrational number approximately equal to 2.71828. The base is not
actually written in natural logarithms, so the “e” is invisible.
Inb=c

iS same as

e©=b

Whenever there is a natural logarithm question on the ACT, it most commonly asks you to solve for a variable.
To do so, you will need to go from logarithmic form to exponential form and then solve for the variable using
basic algebra.

Example 5: If In(x — 1) = 3, thenx =?

A.

e? +1

B. 1-e?

C. n2

D. n3+1

Solution: First, we need to go from logarithmic form to exponential form. The base 1s e and the exponent is
3, SO we get

ee=x-1
To solve, we add 1 to both sides to isolate x.

ee+1=x
The answer is A.
