## 📊 Sample Comparison: Math - Absolute Value

### Original Opening:
> "Absolute value is one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics, appearing frequently on the ACT in various contexts including equations, inequalities, and coordinate geometry. Understanding how to work with absolute value expressions, solve absolute value equations and inequalities, and interpret absolute value graphically is essential for success on the ACT Math section. This lesson provides a comprehensive treatment of absolute value, covering everything from basic definitions through advanced problem-solving techniques."

**Issues**: 71 words, no highlighted terms, boring

### Restructured Opening:
> "<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Absolute value</strong> measures the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">distance from zero</strong> on the number line, always producing a non-negative result. On the ACT, you'll encounter absolute value in <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">equations</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">inequalities</strong>, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">graph transformations</strong>. Master the two-case approach and the critical AND/OR distinction for inequalities."

**Improvements**: 51 words, 5 blue key terms, practical hook, clear expectations

## 🔍 Key Structural Improvements

### 1. Bullet Points Everywhere
**Before**:
```
The ACT Science section is the fourth and final section of the test, consisting of
6-7 passages with 40 total questions. You have exactly 35 minutes to complete all
questions, which translates to approximately 5 minutes per passage. Understanding
the structure, passage types, and time constraints is essential for developing an
effective strategy that maximizes your score.
```

**After**:
```
<ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">35 minutes total</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">6-7 passages</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">40 questions</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">~5 minutes per passage</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">~52.5 seconds per question</li>
</ul>
```

### 2. Red-Bordered Example Boxes
**Before**: Inline text mixing examples with explanations

**After**:
```html
<h4 style="margin: 0 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 0.75rem; border-left: 4px solid #b91c1c;
     color: #000000; font-weight: 700;">Example 1: Basic Equation</h4>

<p>Solve |x| = 7</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>x = 7 or x = -7</li>
  <li><strong>Check:</strong> |7| = 7 ✓ and |-7| = 7 ✓</li>
</ul>
```

### 3. Step-by-Step Processes
**Before**: Paragraph explaining the process

**After**:
```html
<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Step 1: Check the Right Side</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>If a > 0:</strong> |x| = a has two solutions: x = a or x = -a</li>
  <li><strong>If a = 0:</strong> |x| = 0 has one solution: x = 0</li>
  <li><strong>If a < 0:</strong> |x| = a has no solution</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">Step 2: Isolate the Absolute Value</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Before creating cases, ensure the absolute value expression is isolated</li>
  <li>Example: In 2|x| + 3 = 11, subtract 3 to get 2|x| = 8, then divide by 2</li>
</ul>
```

### 4. "When to Use" Sections
**Added to all lessons**:
```html
<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
6. When to Use Absolute Value Concepts</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Distance problems:</strong> When measuring distance between two points</li>
  <li><strong>Range problems:</strong> When a value must be within a certain range</li>
  <li><strong>Graph transformations:</strong> When analyzing V-shaped graphs</li>
  <li><strong>Error tolerance:</strong> When dealing with acceptable margins of error</li>
</ul>
```
