The essay is describing Marshall's research process, and this sentence breaks that narrative thread.\n\n**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**\n\n**Choice B:** Is incorrect because the reason for deleting the sentence is not about failing to clarify why Marshall researched in Mozambique.\n\n**Choice C:** Is incorrect because the sentence does not explain how Marshall created a large scientific institution from being a lone researcher.\n\n**Choice D:** Is incorrect because clarifying Marshall's role at the Center is not relevant to the main narrative about her discovery process."

Sentence 1 likely discusses Marshall collecting data, and the new sentence provides specific examples of what that basic data included (coloration and size).

The additional phrases in the other choices are redundant since the length and scenery of the gorge have already been established earlier in the passage.\n\n**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**\n\n**Choice A:** Is wordy and repetitive.\n\n**Choice B:** Unnecessarily repeats the length information.\n\n**Choice C:** Adds unnecessary words about scenery that has already been described."

The context already makes clear that the highway was built for people to experience the gorge.\n\n**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**\n\n**Choice F:** Is redundant and wordy.\n\n**Choice G:** Is also redundant.\n\n**Choice H:** Is still somewhat redundant, though less so than F."

    "new_explanation": "**Correct Answer: H**\nBecause 'road and' creates a clear, concise connection between 'road' and 'its place in history.' The possessive 'its' correctly refers back to 'road.'\n\n**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**\n\n**Choice F:** Uses 'these structures and it's,' where 'it's' is the contraction for 'it is,' which is incorrect; it should be the possessive 'its.'\n\n**Choice G:** Is vague and awkward.\n\n**Choice J:** Incorrectly uses 'it's' as a contraction."

    "new_explanation": "**Correct Answer: A**\nBecause adding 'an unprecedented five' highlights the impressive design of the highway by emphasizing that having five openings in one tunnel was unusual and remarkable. This detail enhances the reader's appreciation of the engineering achievement.\n\n**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**\n\n**Choice B:** Is incorrect because the phrase does not hint at how the openings were made.\n\n**Choice C:** Is incorrect because the information is directly related to describing the tunnel's impressive features.\n\n**Choice D:** Is incorrect because the phrase emphasizes difficulty and impressiveness, not ease."

    "question_number": 54,
    "new_explanation": "**Correct Answer: J**\nBecause 'tunnel, enabling' uses a comma followed by a participial phrase to show how the openings in the tunnel enabled travelers to take in views. This creates a smooth, logical connection.\n\n**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**\n\n**Choice F:** Uses a dash and 'that enabled,' which is more awkward and interrupting.\n\n**Choice G:** Uses a semicolon, which would require an independent clause to follow.\n\n**Choice H:** Creates a vague pronoun reference with 'this.'"

It logically connects the increased automobile use to what happened to the original highway.\n\n**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**\n\n**Choice A:** 'However' suggests contrast, which is not the relationship here.\n\n**Choice C:** Is vague about the time relationship.\n\n**Choice D:** Removes the needed transitional connection between ideas."

It directly states the fact without unnecessary elaboration.\n\n**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**\n\n**Choice G:** Is overly wordy with 'continued in a functional capacity.'\n\n**Choice H:** Is redundant with both 'continued to be utilized' and the mention of the 1922 completion.\n\n**Choice J:** Is wordy and uses unnecessarily complex language with 'driving populace.'"

This maintains consistency in sentence structure.\n\n**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**\n\n**Choice F:** Uses a different pattern with 'Workers have emptied.'\n\n**Choice H:** Uses an awkward construction that does not match the pattern.\n\n**Choice J:** Uses a participial phrase that does not match the established pattern."

This creates effective closure by connecting the conclusion to the introduction.\n\n**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**\n\n**Choice A:** Does not reference the first paragraph.\n\n**Choice B:** Focuses on sections where motor vehicle traffic is not feasible, which does not tie back to the opening.\n\n**Choice D:** Mentions tourism but does not specifically reference Hill and Lancaster's vision from the first paragraph."

Paragraph 3 discusses the renewed interest in the highway and the restoration work, so adding information about restoration would fit best there.\n\n**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**\n\n**Choice F:** Is too early, as the essay has not yet discussed the need for restoration.\n\n**Choice G:** Focuses on the original construction.\n\n**Choice H:** Is still focused on the original highway construction."

Hip-hop was in the process of emerging at that time.\n\n**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**\n\n**Choice F:** Uses present perfect 'has emerged,' which incorrectly suggests the action continues to the present.\n\n**Choice G:** Is also present perfect and uses the wrong number agreement.\n\n**Choice J:** Is present progressive, which does not match the past time frame."

It directly states that the crowd followed the DJ's command without unnecessary elaboration.\n\n**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**\n\n**Choice B:** Is redundant, adding 'throwing their hands in the air' when that has already been stated as what the DJ commanded.\n\n**Choice C:** Is redundant; 'heeded' and 'obeyed' mean essentially the same thing.\n\n**Choice D:** Is similarly redundant with 'did what he said and obeyed.'"

The dash provides emphasis and clearly signals that what follows specifies the group mentioned.\n\n**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**\n\n**Choice F:** Uses a colon, which is acceptable but less emphatic than a dash.\n\n**Choice H:** Uses a semicolon, which is incorrect because what follows is not an independent clause.\n\n**Choice J:** Uses only a comma, which is too weak for introducing this explanatory list."

The paragraph focuses on the creation of this specific song, and information about other labels is off-topic.\n\n**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**\n\n**Choice A:** Is incorrect because the sentence does not suggest the Sugarhill Gang could choose where to record.\n\n**Choice B:** Is incorrect because the sentence does not explain why the rappers decided to record with Robinson.\n\n**Choice D:** Is incorrect because the time period is not the reason for omitting the sentence."

The song was released, so it garnered critical praise.\n\n**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**\n\n**Choice F:** Uses 'and' which does not show the cause-and-effect relationship as clearly.\n\n**Choice G:** Suggests contrast, which is incorrect.\n\n**Choice J:** Works but 'so' is more direct for showing the result."
