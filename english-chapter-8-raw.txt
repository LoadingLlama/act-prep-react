Than vs. Then
“Than” is only used for comparisons. “Then” has multiple meanings: it can be used when dealing with
time, to mean “in addition to,” or with “if/then” statements. When you see “then” and “than” on the test,
just remember use this quick rule: for a comparison, use “than.” Otherwise, use “then.”
Incorrect: I think that chocolate with almonds is much better then ice cream.
Correct: I think that chocolate with almonds is much better than ice cream.
Incorrect: I need to call my mother, and than we can leave.
Correct: I need to call my mother, and then we can leave.

Have vs. Of
Many people often mistakenly use “could of” or “would of.” This is always incorrect! To be correct, we
need to use “could have” or “would have.” The words “could,” “should,” “would,” and “might” should
always be followed by “have” not “of’. The reason we often make this mistake is the contraction
“could’ve,” which is short for “could have,” is often pronounced like “could of.”
Incorrect: If we left the show earlier, we could of avoided the traffic in the parking lot.
Correct: If we left the could earlier, we could have avoided the traffic in the parking lot.

Countable vs. Non-countable Adjectives
A countable noun is something that you can count, such as bottles of milk or hours. A noncountable
noun is something that cannot be expressed in a plural form, such as time or air. Certain adjectives,
shown in the table below, can only be used to modify countable or non-countable nouns.

Countable

Non-Countable

number

amount

many

much

fewer

less

few

little

Correct: The amount of time to make lunch depends on the number of ingredients in the dish.
Correct: I do not place much significance on how many trophies and athlete has won.
Correct: Skim milk has fewer calories than whole milk, so I drink less whole milk than skim milk.
Correct: I can spare only a little time for this. I need to leave in a few minutes.

Active Voice vs. Passive Voice
Active voice means that the subject of the sentence is performing the verbs action. On the other hand,
passive voice means that the subject is acted on by the verb. On the ACT, never select an answer
choice that is in passive voice; active voice is always better than passive voice.
Active Voice: I picked up the pencil.
Passive Voice: The pencil was picked up by me.
Active Voice: The police chief announced the list of suspects.
Passive Voice: The list of suspects was announced by the police chief.

Prepositional Idioms
In the English language, idioms are expressions that are stated in a certain way because it is a widely
accepted practice. Certain words must be paired with certain prepositions to be correct.
Incorrect: Bobby was afraid by the dark
Correct: Bobby was afraid of the dark.
These questions do not come up often on the ACT, and you should not study this topic unless you
have mastered all other chapters in this course. When prepositional idioms do appear on the ACT, read
the entire sentence and rely on what sounds best to you. To help you, below is a list of some
prepositional idioms that may appear on the ACT.
You should not try memorize this entire this! It is not the best use of your study time. If you do struggle
on these, study the list below and hopefully it will help you better know what sounds best if you do face
any questions on this on test day.
