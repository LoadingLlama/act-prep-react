Chapter 5: Lines
ACT questions commonly ask you how to use and solve linear functions, which is just a fancy term for lines.
Linear functions appear in the form y = mx + b. In this chapter, we will cover all the equations and common

types of questions that appear on the ACT involving lines in the xy-plane.

Slope
Given any two points on a line (x,, y,) and (x3, y2),
Slope =

The slope measures how steep a line is.

rise

V1 —Y2

run

X4—X2

A line with a higher slope is steeper while a line with a lower slope is

flatter. The rise is the change in the y-coordinates, and the run is the change in the x-coordinates. For

example, if a line has a slope of =, the line will go up 1 unit for every 2 units we move to the right, or it will go
down 1 unit for every 2 units we move to the left. Lines with a positive slope go up and to the right, and lines
with a negative slope go down and to the right.
Example 1: In the standard (x, y) coordinate plane, what is the slope of the line that passes through
(—7, 6) and (2,3) ?

A —25

B—-—=-

C-—-

Solution:

D-3
Slope = -

The answer is C.

Example 2: In the standard (x, y) coordinate plane, a line passes through points (9,7) and (—1,3) and
has a slope of 3. What is the value of r?
A.

33

B. 27

C. 21

Solution:

D.

15

Slope =

r-3

9-(-1)

r—3
10

=3

=3

r—3=30
r = 33
The answer is A.

Slopes of Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
If two lines are parallel, the lines have the same slope. For example, if lines A and B are parallel and line A
has a slope of 3, line B also has a slope of 3.
If two lines are perpendicular, the slopes of the lines are the negative reciprocals of one another. To find
the negative reciprocal, take the slope of the initial line, flip the fraction, and make it negative. For example, if

lines A and B are perpendicular and line A has a slope of = , the slope of line B is -= ,

Example 3: Points (4,10) and (1, 31) are located on line g. If line p is perpendicular to line g, which of
the following equations could be the equation of line p?

A.y=7x+28

Bo y=<x-2

C.y=-7x+10 D. y=-<x+2

Solution: To start, we need to find the slope of line g.
clove

= 10231

ope 4-13
Slope
= —7

Line g has a slope of —7. Since line p is perpendicular to line g, line p must have a slope of = The answer is
B.

Slope-Intercept Form
Slope-intercept form is the simplest form of a line and the one that you are likely most comfortable with.
y=mx+b

where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.
As an example, consider the graph of y = 2x — 2 below:
10

a

/

£

We can see both the slope and the y-intercept on the graph. The y-intercept is where the line crosses the
y-axis, which we can clearly see at y

= —2. We can also see the slope 1s 2 by tracing how the line moves: for

every 2 units we move up, the graph moves one unit to the right. Make sure you are comfortable identifying
the y-intercept and slope of a line from the graph.

Example 4: The graph in the standard (x, y) coordinate plane below is represented by one of the
following equations. Which one?
A.

y=-2x-—3

(0,3)|
~

B. y=2x+3

a

C. y=ix+3
1

(—6,0)

D.

y=5x-3

Solution: To solve, we need to find the y-intercept and the slope. The y-intercept is at y = 3. To find the

slope, we need two points on the line. Here, we can use (—6, 0) and (0, 3).

Slope =

0-3

—3

1

“6-0
-6 2

The slope is - and the y-intercept is y = 3, so the equation of the line is y = =x +3. The answer is C.
Point-Slope Form
If we only know the slope of a line and a point on the line, we need to use point-slope form:

Y—¥1 = M(x
— Xj)
where (x1, y;) is a point on the line and m

is the slope. Once we plug in the slope and point to point-slope

form, we can turn the equation back into slope-intercept form by solving for y.
Example 5: Line w passes through points (2, 10) and (5, —2). What is the y-intercept of line w?
A.

—4

B. 7

C.

12

D.

18

Solution: To start, we need to find the slope of line w.
Slope =

10—(-2)

12

2-5

3

—4

Now that we know the slope, we can use point-slope form. We can plug in either point and solve for y. For

this example, we will use the point (2, 10).
y—10=—-4(%
- 2)
y—-10=—-4x+8
y=-4x+18

Once we have the equation in slope-intercept form, we see that the y-intercept is 18. The answer is D.

Alternate Method — Plug a point into y = mx + b form.
When dealing with lines in y = mx + b form, you can also plug the (x, y) coordinates of a point on the
line into the equation and then solve for the y-intercept. To see how this works, let’s go back to example 5.
Once we found the slope was —4, we could have set the equation up like this:
y=—-4x+b

To find b-value, we can plug in one of the points from the line for x and y and solve for b. Here, we will

use (2, 10).

10 = —4(2) +b
b=18

Now that we know the b-value, we can write the equation in slope-intercept form:
y=-4x+18

Note that this “Plug a point into y = mx + b form” approach and the point-slope form method we used in
the solution to Example 5 both find slope-intercept form. You can use whichever one you feel more
comfortable with on test day.

~34-

Chapter 5: Lines

Standard Form
Lines can also appear in standard form:
Ax+By=C

The coefficients in this form do not show the slope or the y-intercept. They actually show nothing, so standard
form is not particularly useful. To turn standard form into slope-intercept form, solve for y. Once we have the
equation in slope-intercept form, we can find the slope and the y-intercept for the line.
Example 6: In the standard (x, y) coordinate plane, what is the slope of the line —4x + 3y = 15?
A.

—4

4

B. 3

C.

|w

pwod

D.

Solution: Convert the line from standard form to slope-intercept form. To do this, we need to solve for y.
—4x+3y =15
3y =4x+15

4 +5

y= 3%

After putting the line in slope-intercept form, we can see the slope is = The answer is D.
Midpoint Formula

X41 X2 m)

midpoin

Example 7: C is the midpoint of AB. If point A is at (3, 6) and point C is at (5, 2), which of the
following is point B?

A. (4,4)

+B. (1,8)

C (7-2)

—

D. (7,8)

Solution: We are given the midpoint, point C, and one of the endpoints, point A. We can plug the values into
the midpoint formula to solve for the coordinates of point B.
To solve for the x-coordinate, plug in the x-coordinates for the midpoint and the endpoint that we are given.

5 ait
2

10=3+x
x=7

The x-coordinate is x = 7.

To solve for the y-coordinate, plug in the y-coordinates for the midpoint and the endpoint that we are given.

9 = ory
2

4=6+y

y=-2
The y-coordinate is —2. Point B is at (7, —2). The answer is C.

Distance Formula
Given any two points (x1, y,) and (x2, y2),

Distance = /(x, — x2)? + (y1 — y2)”
The distance formula can be used to solve for the distance between any two points in the (x, y) coordinate
plane.

If you do not like the distance formula, you also use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the distance between
two points. To do so, sketch a coordinate plane and drawa triangle, and solve for the hypotenuse. You can
see how this works in the example below.

Example 8: What is the distance, in coordinate units, between the points (—2, 1) and (5, 4) in the

standard (x, y) coordinate plane?

A. 3V2

B. ¥34

Cc. ¥58

D. V74

Solution: We can solve for distance between the two points with the distance formula or by sketching a
triangle.

Method #1 — Distance formula: Solve with the distance formula using (—2, 1) as (x, y,) and (5, 4) as

(x2, 2).
Distance = /(—2 —5)2+ (1 — 4)2
Distance = ./(—7)2 + (—3)?
Distance = V58
The answer is C.

Method #2 — Sketch a triangle: Draw a coordinate plane and make a triangle.
6A

-2y

Using the triangle, we see that the base has a length of 7 and the height has a length of 3. To find the distance
between the 2 points, use the Pythagorean Theorem:

774+
37 =c?
58
= c?

c = V58
The answer is C.

Solving for Intercepts
The x-intercept is the point where a line crosses the x-axis. To solve for the x-intercept, set y = 0 and solve
for x.

The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis. To solve for the y-intercept, set x = 0 and
solve for y.
Example 9: For the line 10 — 2y = 5x, what is the sum of the x-intercept and the y-intercept?
A.

2

B. 3

C. 5

D. 7

Solution: To find the x-intercept, set y = 0 and solve for x.

10 — 2(0)
= 5x
10
= 5x
x=2

The x-intercept is at x = 2.
To find the y-intercept, set x = 0 and solve for y.

10 — 2y = 5(0)
10 —2y =0
2y = 10

y=5
The y-intercept is at y = 5.

The sum of the x-intercept and y-intercept is 2 + 5, which equal 7, so the answer is D.
