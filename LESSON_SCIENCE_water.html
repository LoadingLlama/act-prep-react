Water knowledge questions test your understanding of <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">water's unique physical and chemical properties</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">aquatic ecosystem characteristics</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">water quality parameters and their significance</strong>, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">hydrological cycles and processes</strong>. Water appears in numerous ACT science passages spanning chemistry (solutions, properties), biology (aquatic life, osmosis), Earth science (water cycle, weather), and environmental science (pollution, conservation). This lesson teaches you essential water concepts that repeatedly appear on the ACT, explains how water's molecular structure creates its special properties, provides context for interpreting aquatic ecosystem data, and shows you how to recognize when water's unique characteristics are relevant to understanding experimental results or environmental observations.

1. Water's Molecular Structure and Physical Properties
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Water's formula H₂O represents a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">bent molecular structure</strong> that creates <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">polarity</strong>, which in turn explains many of water's <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">unique properties</strong>.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Water is polar</strong> due to its molecular geometry: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Structure</strong>: The H₂O molecule has a bent shape (not linear). Oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, so electron density concentrates near oxygen, creating a partial negative charge (δ-) on oxygen and partial positive charges (δ+) on hydrogens. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Hydrogen bonding</strong>: The partially positive hydrogen of one water molecule attracts the partially negative oxygen of another water molecule, forming a hydrogen bond. This is a strong intermolecular force (though weaker than covalent bonds within molecules). (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Consequences</strong>: Hydrogen bonding causes water molecules to stick together (cohesion) and to other polar surfaces (adhesion). This explains water's high surface tension, capillary action in plants, and ability to climb up narrow tubes. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ACT context</strong>: Passages may describe experiments where water's polarity matters—for example, why water dissolves salt (ionic compound) but not oil (nonpolar), or why insects can walk on water (surface tension from hydrogen bonding). Understanding that "polar molecules attract other polar molecules" helps predict solubility and behavior.

High Specific Heat Capacity and Heat of Vaporization
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Water has <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">unusually high thermal properties</strong>: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">High specific heat</strong> (4.18 J/g°C): Water requires a lot of energy to change temperature. This means water heats up slowly and cools down slowly, providing temperature stability. Coastal climates are moderated by oceans absorbing and releasing heat gradually. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">High heat of vaporization</strong> (2260 J/g): Converting liquid water to vapor requires substantial energy. This makes evaporation an effective cooling mechanism—when sweat evaporates, it removes significant heat from skin. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Cause</strong>: Hydrogen bonds must be broken to heat water or evaporate it, requiring extra energy. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ACT applications</strong>: Passages about climate (oceans stabilize temperature), biology (sweating cools organisms), or environmental science (water bodies buffer against temperature extremes). If a question asks why temperature changed less in water than in sand under the same heat input, the answer relates to water's high specific heat. If asked why evaporation cools, it's because energy is absorbed during phase change.

Density Anomaly: Ice Floats
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Water's density behavior is unusual</strong>: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Most substances</strong>: Solids are denser than liquids (molecules pack closer when solid), so solids sink in their own liquids. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Water is different</strong>: Ice is less dense than liquid water, so ice floats. Maximum density of water is at 4°C, not at its freezing point (0°C). (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Cause</strong>: When water freezes, hydrogen bonds form a crystalline lattice with more space between molecules than in liquid water, decreasing density. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Biological importance</strong>: Ice floating on lakes insulates the liquid water below, allowing aquatic life to survive winter. If ice sank, lakes would freeze solid from bottom up, killing most organisms. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ACT context</strong>: Passages about aquatic ecosystems in winter, or questions asking why ice forms on top of ponds. The answer relates to density differences. Also, water's expansion when freezing can crack rocks (mechanical weathering) or burst pipes—density anomaly has physical consequences.

Universal Solvent Properties
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Water is called the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"universal solvent"</strong> because it dissolves many substances: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Polar and ionic substances dissolve</strong>: Water's polarity allows it to surround and separate ions (like Na⁺ and Cl⁻ from salt) or dissolve polar molecules (like sugar). The partially negative oxygen attracts cations; partially positive hydrogens attract anions. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Nonpolar substances don't dissolve</strong>: "Like dissolves like"—polar water doesn't mix with nonpolar substances like oils, fats, or waxes. These substances are hydrophobic (water-fearing). (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Biological significance</strong>: Water transports nutrients and wastes in organisms because it can dissolve so many different chemicals. Blood plasma is mostly water carrying dissolved oxygen, glucose, ions, proteins (some), and waste products. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Environmental significance</strong>: Water dissolves pollutants, minerals, gases (like oxygen and CO₂). This makes it essential for life but also means pollution spreads easily through water systems. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ACT applications</strong>: Questions about which substances dissolve in water (ionic salts, polar molecules yes; oils no), or why water is crucial for transporting materials in living systems. If comparing solvents, remember water dissolves polar/ionic substances best.

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Water's Properties in ACT Questions</strong><br><br>
<strong>Question Type 1: Solubility</strong><br>
"Which substance would dissolve most readily in water?"<br>
Choices: (A) Table salt (NaCl) (B) Vegetable oil (C) Wax (D) Butter<br>
Answer: (A) NaCl is ionic, dissolves in polar water. Others are nonpolar/hydrophobic.<br><br>
<strong>Question Type 2: Temperature Stability</strong><br>
"Why do coastal areas have smaller temperature fluctuations than inland areas?"<br>
Answer: Water's high specific heat—oceans absorb heat without large temperature changes, moderating nearby air temperature.<br><br>
<strong>Question Type 3: Ice and Aquatic Life</strong><br>
"How does ice formation on a lake's surface help fish survive winter?"<br>
Answer: Ice is less dense than water, so it floats. The ice layer insulates liquid water below, preventing the entire lake from freezing and allowing fish to survive in liquid water beneath the ice.<br><br>
<strong>Question Type 4: Hydrogen Bonding</strong><br>
"What causes water to have high surface tension?"<br>
Answer: Hydrogen bonding between water molecules creates cohesive forces that resist surface disruption, producing surface tension.

2. Water Quality Parameters and Their Significance
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
ACT passages about water quality measure various <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">parameters</strong> that indicate <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ecological health</strong> and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">suitability for organisms</strong>.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Dissolved Oxygen (DO) and Its Importance
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Dissolved oxygen</strong> is oxygen gas (O₂) dissolved in water: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Measurement</strong>: Typically measured in mg/L or ppm (parts per million). Healthy aquatic systems have 5-14 mg/L DO. Below 5 mg/L stresses fish; below 2-3 mg/L causes fish kills. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Factors affecting DO</strong>: (a) Temperature—cold water holds more oxygen than warm water. (b) Photosynthesis—plants produce oxygen during the day, increasing DO. (c) Decomposition—bacteria consuming organic matter use oxygen, decreasing DO. (d) Turbulence—moving water absorbs oxygen from air; still water has less. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Pollution impact</strong>: Organic pollution (sewage, agricultural runoff) promotes bacterial growth that depletes oxygen (eutrophication). Low DO indicates poor water quality. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ACT scenarios</strong>: Tables showing DO levels at different times (higher during day due to photosynthesis, lower at night when respiration continues without photosynthesis). Or comparing DO in polluted vs. clean streams (polluted has lower DO). Questions ask what low DO indicates (pollution/decomposition) or which organisms tolerate low DO (some invertebrates, not most fish).
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
pH Levels in Aquatic Systems
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">pH measures acidity/basicity</strong>: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Scale</strong>: pH 7 is neutral, <7 is acidic, >7 is basic (alkaline). Each pH unit represents a 10-fold change in [H⁺]. Natural water systems are typically pH 6.5-8.5. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Factors affecting pH</strong>: (a) Dissolved CO₂ forms carbonic acid, lowering pH. (b) Limestone/carbonate rocks increase pH (basic). (c) Acid rain (from sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides) lowers pH. (d) Photosynthesis removes CO₂, potentially raising pH. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Biological significance</strong>: Most aquatic organisms require pH 6.5-8.5. Extreme pH (very acidic or very basic) denatures proteins and disrupts metabolic processes. Acid rain lowering lake pH below 5 kills fish and amphibians. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Buffering</strong>: Some water systems have high buffering capacity (resist pH change) due to carbonates or other buffer compounds. Soft water (low mineral content) has poor buffering and is vulnerable to acid rain. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ACT context</strong>: Passages about acid rain effects, or comparing lakes with different buffering capacities. Questions might ask why pH dropped after industrial pollution (acid rain introduction) or why one lake's pH changed less than another's (better buffering).
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Turbidity, Suspended Solids, and Water Clarity
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Turbidity</strong> measures water cloudiness: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Causes</strong>: Suspended particles like silt, algae, organic matter, microscopic organisms. Erosion, runoff, algae blooms, and pollution increase turbidity. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Measurement</strong>: Often in NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Units). Clear water has <5 NTU; turbid water >50 NTU. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Effects on ecosystems</strong>: (a) Reduces light penetration, limiting photosynthesis by aquatic plants. Less plant growth means less oxygen production and less food for herbivores. (b) Clogs fish gills, reducing oxygen uptake. (c) Interferes with predator vision (fish can't see prey). (d) Indicates erosion or pollution. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Related concept—Secchi disk</strong>: A tool to measure water clarity. Lower the disk into water until it disappears; greater depth = clearer water. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ACT scenarios</strong>: Comparing turbidity before/after rain (increased after due to runoff), or relating turbidity to plant growth (higher turbidity correlates with less plant growth due to reduced light). Questions ask what high turbidity indicates (erosion, algae bloom, pollution) or effects on aquatic life (reduced photosynthesis, stressed fish).

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Nutrient Levels: Nitrogen and Phosphorus
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Nutrients</strong> (especially nitrogen and phosphorus) are essential but harmful in excess: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Sources</strong>: Agricultural fertilizer runoff, sewage, animal waste. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Eutrophication</strong>: Excess nutrients cause algae blooms. Algae grow rapidly, covering the surface. When algae die, bacteria decompose them, consuming large amounts of oxygen. This creates hypoxic (low oxygen) zones, killing fish and other aerobic organisms. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Indicators</strong>: High nitrogen (nitrate, ammonia) and phosphorus levels indicate nutrient pollution. Normal levels: nitrate <10 mg/L, phosphorus <0.1 mg/L in lakes. Eutrophic waters exceed these significantly. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Effects</strong>: Loss of biodiversity (sensitive species die, only pollution-tolerant species survive), foul odors, unsuitability for drinking or recreation. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ACT context</strong>: Passages comparing water quality near agricultural areas (high nutrients) vs. forested areas (low nutrients). Questions about why algae bloomed (nutrient increase from fertilizer runoff), or why fish died after algae bloom (oxygen depletion during decomposition). Understanding the nutrient → algae bloom → oxygen depletion → fish kill sequence is key.
</p>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #3b82f6; padding: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Water Quality Interpretation</strong><br><br>
<strong>Scenario:</strong> Table shows data from two streams<br><br>
<strong>Stream A (upstream, forested area):</strong><br>
DO: 8.5 mg/L, pH: 7.2, Turbidity: 3 NTU, Nitrate: 1.5 mg/L<br><br>
<strong>Stream B (downstream, near farms):</strong><br>
DO: 3.2 mg/L, pH: 7.8, Turbidity: 28 NTU, Nitrate: 15 mg/L<br><br>
<strong>Analysis:</strong><br>
1. Stream B has lower DO (3.2 vs 8.5) → Poor oxygen, likely stressed fish<br>
2. Stream B has higher turbidity (28 vs 3) → Cloudy water, possibly from erosion/algae<br>
3. Stream B has higher nitrate (15 vs 1.5) → Nutrient pollution from farm fertilizer<br><br>
<strong>Question: Why is Stream B's DO lower?</strong><br>
Answer: Agricultural runoff increased nitrates → algae bloom → bacterial decomposition of dead algae consumes oxygen → DO drops<br><br>
<strong>Question: Which stream has better water quality?</strong><br>
Answer: Stream A—higher DO, lower turbidity, lower nitrates indicate healthier ecosystem

3. Aquatic Ecosystems and Zones
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Understanding <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">aquatic ecosystem structure</strong> helps interpret passages about <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">organism distribution</strong> and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">environmental gradients</strong> in water bodies.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Lake Zones: Littoral, Limnetic, Profundal, Benthic
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Lakes are divided into <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">zones</strong> based on depth and light: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Littoral zone</strong>: Shallow, near shore. Sunlight reaches bottom. Has rooted plants, high biodiversity. Warm, nutrient-rich. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Limnetic zone</strong>: Open water, surface to depth where light penetrates (photic zone). Plankton (algae, tiny organisms) dominate. Primary productivity occurs here. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Profundal zone</strong>: Deep water below light penetration (aphotic zone). No photosynthesis. Decomposers and fish that feed on detritus. Cooler, lower oxygen than surface. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Benthic zone</strong>: Bottom sediments, any depth. Decomposers, burrowing organisms, sediment-dwelling invertebrates. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ACT applications</strong>: Questions about where photosynthesis occurs (littoral and limnetic—where light reaches), where decomposition is highest (benthic—organic matter settles), or which zone has most plant species (littoral—shallow enough for rooted plants). If a passage presents data collected at different depths, understand that shallow areas differ from deep areas in light, oxygen, temperature, and organisms.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Marine Zones: Intertidal, Neritic, Oceanic
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Ocean zones</strong> are defined by depth and proximity to shore: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Intertidal zone</strong>: Area between high and low tide. Organisms must tolerate exposure to air (during low tide) and submersion (during high tide). Extreme conditions, high stress, specialized organisms. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Neritic zone</strong>: Shallow ocean over continental shelf (shoreline to ~200 m depth). Sunlight reaches bottom. High productivity, coral reefs, kelp forests. Rich fisheries. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Oceanic zone</strong>: Open ocean beyond continental shelf. Deep water. Further divided: (a) Photic zone (0-200 m, light penetrates, photosynthesis occurs). (b) Aphotic zone (below 200 m, no light, no photosynthesis, organisms depend on detritus or chemosynthesis). (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Depth and pressure</strong>: Deep ocean has high pressure, low temperature, no light. Specialized organisms (bioluminescent, high-pressure adaptations). (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ACT scenarios</strong>: Comparing organism abundance by zone (neritic has more diversity than deep oceanic due to light/nutrients), or asking why certain organisms live in specific zones (intertidal organisms must tolerate desiccation).

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Thermal Stratification in Lakes
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Thermal stratification</strong> creates distinct temperature layers: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Summer stratification</strong>: (a) Epilimnion (top layer)—warm, well-mixed by wind, high oxygen. (b) Thermocline (middle layer)—rapid temperature drop with depth. (c) Hypolimnion (bottom layer)—cold, still, oxygen can be depleted if organic matter decomposes. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Winter stratification</strong>: In temperate zones, surface water cools. Water is densest at 4°C. In winter, 4°C water sinks to bottom, 0°C ice forms on top. This inverse stratification protects bottom-dwelling organisms. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Turnover</strong>: In spring and fall, temperature equalizes, and wind mixes the entire lake, redistributing oxygen and nutrients. This is called lake turnover. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Biological implications</strong>: During summer stratification, hypolimnion can become anoxic (no oxygen) if isolated from surface oxygen. Fall turnover replenishes oxygen. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ACT context</strong>: Graphs showing temperature vs. depth in summer (distinct layers) vs. fall (uniform temperature). Questions about when oxygen is replenished in deep water (during turnover) or why fish avoid deep water in summer (low oxygen in hypolimnion).

Freshwater vs. Marine Ecosystem Differences
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Key differences</strong> between freshwater and marine systems: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Salinity</strong>: Freshwater <0.5 ppt (parts per thousand); marine ~35 ppt. Organisms are adapted to one or the other. Marine fish drink water and excrete salt; freshwater fish do the opposite. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Osmosis</strong>: In freshwater, water enters organisms' cells (hypotonic environment). In seawater, water leaves cells (hypertonic environment). Organisms have osmoregulation adaptations. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Biodiversity</strong>: Marine systems have higher overall biodiversity, but freshwater has high diversity relative to volume (only 2.5% of Earth's water is fresh). (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Nutrient cycling</strong>: Freshwater systems often nutrient-limited (especially phosphorus). Marine systems vary—coastal areas nutrient-rich, open ocean often nutrient-poor except upwelling zones. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ACT applications</strong>: Questions about why a fish died when moved from freshwater to saltwater (osmoregulation failure), or comparing pollution impacts (freshwater systems more vulnerable to eutrophication due to limited dilution compared to vast oceans).

<strong>Example: Aquatic Zones and Stratification</strong><br><br>
<strong>Question 1: Lake zones</strong><br>

Data shows lake in August: Surface temp 24°C, 10m depth 15°C, 20m depth 8°C<br>
"Why might fish avoid depths below 15m in summer?"<br>
Answer: Hypolimnion (deep layer) has low oxygen during summer stratification because decomposition consumes oxygen and no mixing occurs with oxygen-rich surface water<br><br>
<strong>Question 3: Marine zones</strong><br>
"Which zone experiences the most variable environmental conditions?"<br>
Answer: Intertidal zone—organisms exposed to air at low tide (desiccation risk, temperature extremes) and submerged at high tide (waves, predators)<br><br>
<strong>Question 4: Freshwater vs. Marine</strong><br>
"A marine fish placed in freshwater would likely:"<br>
Answer: Absorb too much water and swell (freshwater is hypotonic relative to fish's body fluids, causing water to enter cells via osmosis)

4. Hydrological Cycle and Water Movement
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">water cycle</strong> describes water movement through Earth's systems, appearing in <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Earth science and environmental passages</strong>.

Major Processes: Evaporation, Condensation, Precipitation
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">water cycle</strong> involves continuous movement: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Evaporation</strong>: Liquid water (oceans, lakes, rivers) becomes water vapor using solar energy. Higher temperature and wind increase evaporation rate. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Transpiration</strong>: Plants release water vapor from leaves. Combined with evaporation, called evapotranspiration. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Condensation</strong>: Water vapor cools and forms liquid droplets (clouds, fog). Requires condensation nuclei (dust particles) and cooling (rising air, contact with cold surfaces). (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Precipitation</strong>: Water falls as rain, snow, sleet, hail when droplets become too heavy to remain suspended. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Infiltration and runoff</strong>: Precipitation either soaks into ground (infiltration, recharging groundwater) or flows over surface (runoff into streams/lakes). (6) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ACT applications</strong>: Diagrams showing cycle components. Questions ask what increases evaporation (higher temperature, more surface area), or what determines whether water infiltrates or runs off (soil type, vegetation, slope).

Groundwater: Aquifers, Recharge, and Wells
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Groundwater</strong> is water stored underground: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Aquifers</strong>: Underground layers of permeable rock/sediment holding water. Water fills pore spaces between particles. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Water table</strong>: Upper surface of saturated zone. Below the water table, all spaces are filled with water. Above it, spaces contain air and some water. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Recharge</strong>: Process of water infiltrating soil and refilling aquifers. Recharge occurs where precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration and runoff, especially in permeable soils. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Wells</strong>: Holes drilled below the water table to extract groundwater. Over-pumping lowers the water table, potentially drying up wells. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Contamination</strong>: Pollutants can infiltrate and contaminate aquifers. Groundwater moves slowly, so contamination persists for long periods. (6) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ACT scenarios</strong>: Questions about where water comes from in wells (aquifer below water table), or why groundwater contamination is serious (slow movement means pollutants remain for years, affecting drinking water).

Surface Water Movement: Runoff, Streams, Watersheds
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Surface water systems</strong> transport water across land: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Runoff</strong>: Water flowing over land surface toward streams/rivers/lakes. Caused by precipitation exceeding infiltration capacity. Increases with impermeable surfaces (pavement), steep slopes, and heavy rain. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Watersheds (drainage basins)</strong>: Area of land where all water drains to a common outlet (river, lake). Dividing ridges separate watersheds. Everything happening in a watershed affects downstream water quality. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Stream characteristics</strong>: (a) Headwaters (source)—small, clear, cold, high oxygen, often in mountains. (b) Middle reaches—wider, moderate flow, diverse habitats. (c) Mouth—wide, slow, often turbid, warmer, lower oxygen. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Human impacts</strong>: Deforestation increases runoff (less infiltration), urbanization creates impermeable surfaces (more runoff, more flooding), dams alter flow patterns. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ACT context</strong>: Maps of watersheds, questions about why pollution in one area affects water miles downstream (watershed connectivity), or why urban areas have more flooding (increased runoff from pavement).

Water Residence Time and Distribution
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Residence time</strong> is how long water remains in a reservoir: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Ocean residence time</strong>: ~3,000 years (vast volume, slow cycling). (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Groundwater</strong>: Weeks to 10,000 years (depending on aquifer depth and flow rate). (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Lakes</strong>: Months to years. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Rivers</strong>: Days to weeks (constantly flowing). (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Atmosphere</strong>: ~9 days (water vapor condenses quickly). (6) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Distribution</strong>: 97% of Earth's water is saltwater (oceans). Of the 3% freshwater, ~69% is ice (glaciers, ice caps), ~30% is groundwater, <1% is surface water (lakes, rivers) and atmosphere. (7) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Implications</strong>: Freshwater for human use is limited. Groundwater contamination is serious due to long residence time (pollutants persist). (8) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ACT applications</strong>: Questions about which reservoir has the most water (oceans), or which reservoir cycles fastest (atmosphere/rivers), or why groundwater pollution is long-lasting (slow movement, long residence time).

<strong>Example: Water Cycle and Movement</strong><br><br>
<strong>Question 1: Evaporation factors</strong><br>
"Which condition would increase evaporation rate from a lake?"<br>
Choices: (A) Lower temperature (B) Higher humidity (C) Increased wind speed (D) Cloud cover<br>
Answer: (C) Wind increases evaporation by removing vapor-saturated air from surface<br><br>
<strong>Question 2: Groundwater</strong><br>
"A well stops producing water during a drought. Why?"<br>
Answer: Reduced precipitation → less recharge → water table drops below well depth<br><br>
<strong>Question 3: Watershed</strong><br>
"Agricultural fertilizer applied in the northern part of a watershed is detected in a lake to the south. Why?"<br>
Answer: Runoff carries fertilizer through the watershed to the lake (all water in a watershed drains to common outlet)<br><br>
<strong>Question 4: Residence time</strong><br>
"Why does groundwater contamination persist longer than river contamination?"<br>
Answer: Groundwater has much longer residence time (slow movement through aquifer) compared to rivers (fast-flowing), so pollutants remain for years vs. days/weeks
