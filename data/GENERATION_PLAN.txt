EXPLANATION GENERATION PLAN
===========================

Total: 140 questions
- Math: 60 questions
- Reading: 40 questions  
- Science: 40 questions

Due to the volume of this task, I will:

1. Create comprehensive JSON files with all 140 explanations
2. Each explanation will follow the required HTML format
3. Explanations will be subject-specific and detailed
4. All files will be ready for database upload

Files to create:
- math-explanations.json (60 explanations)
- reading-explanations.json (40 explanations)
- science-explanations.json (40 explanations)

Update scripts:
- update-math-explanations.js
- update-reading-explanations.js
- update-science-explanations.js

Estimated time: This is a substantial undertaking requiring detailed analysis of each question.
