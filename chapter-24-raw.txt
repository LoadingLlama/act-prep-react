Chapter 24: Sequences
For test day, you need to know how to handle arithmetic, geometric, and recursive sequences. In this chapter,
we will review the basics of these three types of sequences, the equations that you need to memorize, and how
to solve any sequence questions.

Arithmetic Sequences
Arithmetic sequences are sequences using addition and subtraction between terms. The common
difference, which is the number that is added or subtracted between consecutive terms, is constant. For
example, let’s consider the arithmetic sequence below:
4,8,12, 16, 20, 24...

For this sequence, the common difference is +4 because we see 4 is the difference between consecutive
terms. For easier arithmetic sequence questions, which commonly appear in the first 30 questions of the ACT,
you need to be able to find the common difference in a sequence and use that to find a later term in the
sequence.

Example 1: In a certain arithmetic sequence, the Ist and 4th terms are 3 and 24 respectively. What is the
Sth term of the arithmetic sequence?
A.

27

B. 30

C. 31

D. 37

Solution: For any arithmetic sequence questions, we recommend drawing out the sequence and filling in any
numbers in the sequence you are given. A simple visual can make it much easier to solve these questions
correctly.

lstterm

2ndterm

3rdterm

4thterm

5th term

Now that we have a diagram, we can more easily see how to solve for the common difference. To go from the
lst to 4th term, we must add the common difference 3 times. The total difference between the Ist and 4th
terms is 21, so the common difference is 7.
The find the 5th term, we add 7 to the 24 to get 31. The answer is C.

More difficult arithmetic sequence questions will ask you to solve for a term much later in the sequence. What
if you were asked to find the 88th term in the sequence above? You do not want to add the common difference
over and over and over again... we need a faster way! To solve this quickly, we use the equation
t, =t,+d(n-1)
where ¢, is the first term in the sequence, d is the common difference, t,, is the nth term, and n is the term
number. You need to memorize this equation for test day.
Let’s use the equation to find the 88th term in the sequence for example 1. The first term is 3, the common
difference is 7, and we are looking for the 88th term, so we get

tgs

=

3+7(88-—1) = 612

The 88th term in the sequence is 612.
Example 2: The 3rd and 5th terms in an arithmetic sequence are —4 and 11 respectively. What is the
45th term of this sequence?
A.

311

B. 318.5

C. 326

D. 329

Solution: First, we need to find the common difference. It is always best to draw out a diagram to help
visualize the sequence.

To go from the 3rd to 5th term, we must add the common difference 2 times. The difference between the 3rd

and 5th terms is 15, so the common difference 1s = or 7.5. Now that we know the common difference, we can
fill in the rest of the terms in our diagram.

Now that we know the Ist term, we can use our equation to solve for the 45th term.

ty,

= —194+7.5(45—-1) = 311

The answer is A.

Geometric Sequences
Geometric sequences are sequences using multiplication and division between terms. The common ratio,
which is the number that each consecutive term is multiplied or divided by, is constant. For example, let’s
consider the geometric sequence below:
3,6,12,24,48,96...

For this sequence, the common ratio is X 2 because we multiply by 2 between consecutive terms. For
geometric sequence questions on the ACT, you need to find the common ratio and use that to find other terms
in the sequence.
Example 3: The Ist term in a geometric sequence is 560 and the second term is —280. What is the 5th

term of the geometric sequence?
A.

70

B. 35

C. 17.5

D. —35

Solution: To start, let’s make a diagram of the sequence.
560

—280

lIstterm

2ndterm

3rdterm

4thterm

45thterm

Now, we need to find the common ratio. To find a common ratio, you can take any term in a geometric
sequence, here we will use —280, and divide it by the previous term, which here is 560. So, the common ratio
-

—280

is ——

560

=

1

—=

2°

Once we know the common ratio, we can use it to find the other terms in the sequence. To find the 3rd term,

we multiply the second term by — = The 3rd term is — . (—280) = 140. We then repeat this process to find
the 4th and the 5th terms.

5thterm

The 5th term is 35. The answer is B.

Geometric sequences questions are generally not too difficult. For geometric sequences, the ACT has never
asked you to find a term way later in a sequence. Just in case they do, you can memorize the formula below.

t,=t,xr1
where ¢, is the first term in the sequence, r is the common ratio, t, is the nth term, and n is the term number.

Recursive Sequences
A recursive sequence is a sequence in which terms are defined using previous terms and a given

formula. In recursive sequences, we cannot find the current term until we know the previous term. We
cannot find the 3rd term until we know the 2nd term, we cannot find the 4th term until we know the 3rd term,
and so on. That means that we need to solve for the terms in a recursive sequence one term at a time.
If you have never done recursive sequences before, that may all seem very confusing, so let’s use the example
formula below to make it clearer.
An =2An-1+2
nth term

and

rk

(n — 1)th term

a, =3

k

lst term

A, 1s the nth term in the sequence, and a,_, is the previous term right before a,. In a recursive sequence, you

are always given the Ist term, which in this example is a, = 3. To solve for the 2nd term, we use the formula
and plug inn = 2 and get
a, = 2a,+2

In words, the formula says the 2nd term, az, is equal to 2 times the Ist term, a,, plus 2. Since we know that
a, = 3, we can solve az.

a, = 2(3)+2=8
Now that we know the 2nd term, we can solve for the 3rd term, a3. Since we are solving for the 3rd term, we
use the formula and n = 3 and get

a, = 2a,+2 > az =2(8)+2=18
Below, we use the same steps to solve for the 4th term, a,, the 5th term, a;, and the 6th term, ag.

a, = 2a,+2 > a, =2(18)
+ 2 = 38
a, = 2a,+2 > ay = 2(38)
+2 =78
Ag = 2ae
+2 > ag = 2(78)
+2 = 158
We can continue this pattern as long as necessary to find the answer. Most recursive sequence questions on
the ACT will ask you to solve for the 4th, 5th, or 6th term.
Example 4: A sequence is defined for all integers by s, = 3s,_;
A.

10

B. 38

C..114

D.

+n+5 ands, =1. What is s,?

123

Solution: In order to find the 4th term, s,, we need to start by finding the 2nd term, then the 3rd, and then
finally the 4th term. To solve for the 2nd term, we set n = 2 and use the formula and the 1st term, which the
question tells us is equal to 1.

So =35s,+24+5 > s,=301)+2+5
S, = 10

Now that we know the 2nd term, we can find the 3rd term.

S3 = 3s,+34+5 > s, =3(10)+3+4+5
Sz = 38

Once we know the 3rd term, we can find the 4th term.

S4 = 353+44+5 > s, = 3(388) +445
S4 = 123

The 4th term is 123. The answer is D.

Explicit Formula for Recursive Sequences
An explicit formula is an equation that gives the value of a term based on the position in the sequence.

With the explicit formula, you do not need to know the previous terms and can just input the value in the
equation to find the value. For example, if we had the explicit formula:
Aa, =2n+5

We can find any nth term using the equation. To find the 4" term, a,, we plug in n = 4 and solve.
a4 = 2(4)+5=13
Some recursive sequences follow a distinct pattern can be expressed as an explicit formula. The most common
way the ACT tests explicit formulas for sequences is to provide a recursive sequence and ask you to find the
explicit formula.

Example 5: Given the recursive formula below, which of the following equations is a correct explicit
formula for the sequence?
A.

a, =10+4n

B.

a, =6+4n

C.

an = —4+14n

D.

a, =14+4n

a, = 10
An = An-1 +4

Solution: To solve, let’s start finding the values in the recursive formula. We already know the first term is
10, so when n = 1,a, = 10. We can find the following terms in the sequence.
a, =a,+4
> a,=104+4= 14
a3

=a,+4

> az =144+4=18

a4=a3,;+4
> az =184+4=22

At this point, we can notice the pattern: the value increases by 4 as you go from one term to the next. This
means that the slope of the equation must be 4, so we must see 4n in the explicit formula. We can eliminate
answer choice C.
To find the constant (the number) in the explicit formula, we can test using the point(s) that we found. An
easy value to start with is a, = 10. If we plug inn = 1, the correct explicit formula must give a, = 10.

For A: a, = 10+ 4(1) = 14
For B: a,

=6+4(1) = 10

For D: a,

= 144+ 4(1) = 18

Only B gives us the correct value of 10, so we can tell that the answer is B. Notice that if we plug other
values of n directly into the explicit equation, we get the values of az, a3, and a, that we solved for above.
Shortcut Method: If you ever see a question like this on the ACT, start by using the Ist term in the

sequence as a test point. In Example 5, we are given a, = 10, so immediate plug inn = 1 to the explicit
answer choices and eliminate any that do not give you 10. Often on the ACT, only 1 answer works with this
shortcut method, and you can tell the correct answer without finding any other terms in the sequence.
For the example above, we could eliminate A and D immediately. To then tell which answer choice is correct,
find 2nd term and use that as a test point. Once we find a, = 14, only B works, so we can tell that the correct
answer is B.
