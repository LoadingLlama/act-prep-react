## Question #1 - English (Sentence Structure)

**Original Text:** "There are thousands of new animal species identified each year, the vast majority are small..."

**Question:** Which choice best corrects the underlined portion?
- A. NO CHANGE
- B. Scientists say thousands of new animal species are
- C. Of the thousands of new animal species ✓
- D. Thousands of new animal species are

**SPECIFIC EXPLANATION:**

```html
<div style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; color: #374151;">
This choice uses "Of the thousands" to create a dependent prepositional phrase that eliminates the comma splice error in the original sentence. The original reads "There are thousands of new animal species identified each year, the vast majority are small" which incorrectly joins two independent clauses ("There are thousands" and "the vast majority are small") with only a comma. By changing the beginning to "Of the thousands of new animal species identified each year," the first part becomes a subordinate phrase that properly modifies the main clause that follows.

<strong style="font-size: 0.875rem; color: #6b7280;">Why Other Answers Are Wrong:</strong>
<div style="margin-top: 0.5rem; line-height: 1.6; color: #374151;">
<div style="margin-bottom: 0.375rem;"><strong>Choice A (NO CHANGE):</strong> "There are thousands of new animal species identified each year, the vast majority are small" creates a comma splice by incorrectly joining two independent clauses with only a comma. This is a fundamental sentence structure error.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0.375rem;"><strong>Choice B:</strong> "Scientists say thousands of new animal species are identified each year, the vast majority are small" still maintains the comma splice error. While it adds "Scientists say," it doesn't fix the fundamental problem of two independent clauses being joined with only a comma.</div>
<div><strong>Choice D:</strong> "Thousands of new animal species are identified each year, the vast majority are small" also creates a comma splice. Like choice A, it improperly connects two complete sentences with just a comma instead of using proper punctuation or subordination.</div>

## Question #2 - English (Sentence Structure)

**Context from passage:** "Mantas, which are plankton-eating relatives of stingrays..."

**Question:** Which choice best corrects the underlined portion?
- F. NO CHANGE
- G. Mantas are ✓
- H. Mantas,
- J. DELETE the underlined portion

**SPECIFIC EXPLANATION:**

```html
<div style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; color: #374151;">
"Mantas are" correctly creates an independent clause with a clear subject and verb. The sentence needs to establish what mantas are before describing them. This choice provides proper sentence structure: "Mantas are plankton-eating relatives of stingrays that look like pairs of enormous black wings." The verb "are" is essential to complete the thought and create a grammatically complete sentence.

<strong style="font-size: 0.875rem; color: #6b7280;">Why Other Answers Are Wrong:</strong>
<div style="margin-top: 0.5rem; line-height: 1.6; color: #374151;">
<div style="margin-bottom: 0.375rem;"><strong>Choice F (NO CHANGE - "Mantas, which are"):</strong> Using the relative pronoun "which" after a comma creates a non-restrictive clause that leaves the main sentence without a complete predicate. This makes the sentence a fragment because "Mantas" would have no main verb.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0.375rem;"><strong>Choice H ("Mantas,"):</strong> This creates an appositive structure but leaves the sentence without a main verb, resulting in a sentence fragment. The sentence would read "Mantas, plankton-eating relatives..." with no complete predicate.</div>
<div><strong>Choice J (DELETE):</strong> Deleting the underlined portion would merge this sentence awkwardly with the previous one, creating a run-on sentence and disrupting the logical flow of ideas between the two separate thoughts.</div>
</div>

## Question #3 - English (Punctuation)

**Context:** "...that look like pairs of enormous black wings—up to twenty-five feet wide—flying slowly..."

**Question:** Which choice best corrects the underlined portion?
- A. NO CHANGE ✓
- B. wings: up to twenty-five feet wide—
- C. wings, up to twenty-five feet wide—
- D. wings, up to twenty-five feet wide:

**SPECIFIC EXPLANATION:**

```html
<div style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; color: #374151;">
The em dashes (—) are correctly used here to set off the parenthetical information "up to twenty-five feet wide." Em dashes are the appropriate punctuation choice for this dramatic aside that interrupts the main clause to provide a striking physical detail. The paired em dashes "wings—up to twenty-five feet wide—flying" properly bracket the interrupting phrase, allowing the main sentence structure "wings...flying slowly through the water" to remain intact.

<div>
<strong style="font-size: 0.875rem; color: #6b7280;">Why Other Answers Are Wrong:</strong>
<div style="margin-top: 0.5rem; line-height: 1.6; color: #374151;">
<div style="margin-bottom: 0.375rem;"><strong>Choice B:</strong> "wings: up to twenty-five feet wide—" incorrectly mixes punctuation marks by starting with a colon and ending with an em dash. Paired punctuation must match—either both em dashes or both commas. This combination creates inconsistent punctuation.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0.375rem;"><strong>Choice C:</strong> "wings, up to twenty-five feet wide—" mismatches punctuation by opening with a comma but closing with an em dash. Parenthetical elements must use matching punctuation marks on both sides for clarity and correctness.</div>
<div><strong>Choice D:</strong> "wings, up to twenty-five feet wide:" uses mismatched comma and colon. Additionally, a colon would incorrectly suggest that what follows is a list or explanation, when in fact "flying slowly through the water" continues the main sentence structure.</div>
