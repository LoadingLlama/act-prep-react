Must have:\n     - 60-100 words\n     - 3-6 styled bold terms\n     - ACT context (# of questions)\n     ======================================== -->\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">\nUnderstanding the <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">working backwards strategy</strong>, also known as <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">backsolving</strong>, is one of the most powerful time-saving techniques for ACT Math success. This strategy lets you <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">test answer choices</strong> instead of solving algebraically from scratch, saving you valuable time and reducing calculation errors. You can use backsolving on 8-12 questions per test—that's 13-20% of all math questions! This lesson will teach you when to backsolve, how to do it efficiently, and which problems are perfect candidates for this strategy.\n</p>\n\n<!-- ========================================\n     SECTION 2: CONTENT (EXACTLY 4 H3 SECTIONS)\n     Each H3 = Major Concept\n     ======================================== -->\n\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;\">\n1. What Is Backsolving?\n</h3>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">\n<strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">Backsolving</strong> means plugging in the answer choices to solve the problem. Instead of setting up equations and solving for x algebraically, you test each choice until you find the one that satisfies the conditions in the problem. This approach transforms complex algebra into simple arithmetic.\n</p>\n\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\">\nKey Advantages of Backsolving\n</h4>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">\nBacksolving offers several advantages over traditional algebraic methods. First, it's often faster than setting up and solving complex equations. Second, you're less likely to make algebraic mistakes since you're working with concrete numbers instead of abstract variables. Third, you can check your work immediately—if the answer choice makes the equation true, you know you're correct. Finally, even if you struggle with algebra, backsolving lets you find the right answer through systematic testing.\n</p>\n\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\">\nWhen to Use Backsolving\n</h4>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">\nLook for three key indicators that backsolving will work well. First, the problem asks for a <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">specific numerical value</strong> (like \"What is x?\" or \"How many marbles does Sarah have?\"). Second, the answer choices are concrete numbers, not algebraic expressions like \"2x + 3\" or \"a²b\". Third, the traditional algebra looks messy or time-consuming, with complex equations, multiple steps, or tricky manipulations that increase the chance of errors.\n</p>\n\n<!-- Example 1 will be inserted here by ExampleCard component -->\n<!-- Database: position=1, lesson_id=[UUID] -->\n\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;\">\n2. The Five-Step Backsolving Process\n</h3>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">\nFollow this systematic five-step process to backsolve efficiently and accurately. Mastering these steps will help you tackle backsolving problems with confidence and speed.\n</p>\n\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\">\nStep 1: Strategic Starting Point\n</h4>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">\nOn the ACT, answer choices are always listed in <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">ascending order</strong> (smallest to largest) or descending order (largest to smallest). This ordering is your secret weapon. Always start with choice B or C—the <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">middle values</strong>. Why? Because you can often eliminate 2-3 choices with just one test. If C is too big, you know D and E are also too big. If C is too small, you know A and B are also too small. This strategic approach can save you from testing every single choice.\n</p>\n\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\">\nStep 2: Test the Choice\n</h4>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">\nSubstitute your chosen answer into the problem conditions. Ask yourself three questions: Does it make the equation true? Does it satisfy all the constraints given in the problem? Does it produce the correct result when you work through the problem? Be thorough but efficient—check each condition systematically.\n</p>\n\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\">\nStep 3: If It Works, You're Done!\n</h4>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">\nIf the answer choice works correctly and satisfies all problem conditions, you've found your answer. Bubble it in confidently and move on to the next question. Don't waste time double-checking or testing other choices—the ACT only has one correct answer per question.\n</p>\n\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\">\nStep 4: Elimination and Adjustment\n</h4>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">\nIf the answer doesn't work, cross it off immediately. Then use what you learned: Do you need a larger or smaller value? Cross off any other choices you can eliminate based on this information. This <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">systematic elimination</strong> narrows your options quickly.\n</p>\n\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\">\nStep 5: Repeat Until You Find the Answer\n</h4>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">\nPick one of the remaining answer choices and plug it back into the question. Continue this process until you find the choice that works. Remember: one of the five answer choices must work! The ACT always has exactly one correct answer, so trust the process and keep testing systematically.\n</p>\n\n<!-- Example 2 will be inserted here by ExampleCard component -->\n<!-- Database: position=2, lesson_id=[UUID] -->\n\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;\">\n3. Perfect Backsolving Scenarios\n</h3>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">\nCertain problem types are ideal for backsolving. Recognizing these scenarios will help you decide when to use this strategy for maximum efficiency and accuracy on test day.\n</p>\n\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\">\nRadical Equations and Square Roots\n</h4>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">\nProblems involving <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">square roots</strong> and <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">radical expressions</strong> are perfect for backsolving. Algebraically isolating the variable often requires squaring both sides multiple times, which creates opportunities for calculation errors. Backsolving lets you simply test values directly in the original equation, avoiding these messy manipulations entirely.\n</p>\n\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\">\nComplex Word Problems\n</h4>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">\nWord problems with multiple steps or complicated relationships between variables are excellent backsolving candidates. Instead of translating the entire problem into algebra, you can test each answer choice against the problem's conditions. This approach is especially helpful when you understand what the problem is asking but struggle to set up the equations correctly.\n</p>\n\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\">\nSystems of Equations\n</h4>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">\nWhen a problem gives you two or three equations with multiple variables, backsolving can be faster than elimination or substitution methods. Simply plug each answer choice into all the equations and see which value satisfies every equation simultaneously. This saves time and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors in multi-step algebra.\n</p>\n\n<!-- Example 3 will be inserted here by ExampleCard component -->\n<!-- Database: position=3, lesson_id=[UUID] -->\n\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;\">\n4. When NOT to Backsolve\n</h3>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">\nWhile backsolving is powerful, it's not always the best strategy. Learning when to avoid backsolving is just as important as learning when to use it. Smart test-takers recognize these situations and switch to more efficient approaches.\n</p>\n\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\">\nAlgebraic Expression Answers\n</h4>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">\nWhen answer choices are <strong style=\"color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;\">algebraic expressions</strong> rather than numbers (like \"2x + 3\", \"n²\", or \"a/b\"), backsolving doesn't work. You can't plug an expression back into the problem and verify if it's correct. In these cases, use traditional algebra to simplify and solve.\n</p>\n\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\">\nSimple Direct Algebra\n</h4>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">\nIf the traditional algebra is very simple—like \"2x + 3 = 11, solve for x\"—just solve it directly. Backsolving takes longer than one or two steps of basic algebra. Save backsolving for problems where the algebra is complex or time-consuming.\n</p>\n\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\">\nTesting Takes More Work Than Solving\n</h4>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">\nOccasionally, testing an answer choice requires more calculation than solving the problem directly. If you realize that plugging in values and checking conditions will take longer than algebraic solution, switch strategies. The goal is efficiency—use whichever method gets you to the correct answer fastest.\n</p>\n\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;\">\nMultiple Variables with Complex Relationships\n</h4>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">\nWhen problems involve many variables with interconnected relationships, backsolving can become confusing. You might need to calculate multiple dependent values for each answer choice, which introduces more opportunities for errors. In these cases, setting up equations systematically is often clearer and more reliable.\n</p>\n\n<!-- Example 4 will be inserted here by ExampleCard component -->\n<!-- Database: position=4, lesson_id=[UUID] -->\n\n<!-- ========================================\n     SECTION 3: HIDDEN SEPARATOR\n     CRITICAL: Parser needs this!\n     ======================================== -->\n\n<h3 style=\"visibility: hidden; margin: 0; padding: 0; line-height: 0; height: 0;\">\nHidden Separator\n</h3>\n\n<!-- ========================================\n     SECTION 4: KEY TAKEAWAYS\n     SIMPLE GREEN LIST - NO GRADIENT BOXES\n     ======================================== -->\n\n<h3 style=\"color: #2e7d32; font-size: 1.4rem; font-weight: 700; margin: 3rem 0 1.5rem 0;\">\nKey Takeaways\n</h3>\n\n<ul style=\"list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;\">\n  <li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;\">\n    <span style=\"color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;\">✓</span>Backsolving means testing answer choices instead of solving algebraically—use it when answer choices are numbers and algebra looks complex\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;\">\n    <span style=\"color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;\">✓</span>Always start with choice B or C (the middle value) to eliminate 2-3 choices with one test\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;\">\n    <span style=\"color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;\">✓</span>Perfect for radical equations, complex word problems, and systems of equations where algebra gets messy\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;\">\n    <span style=\"color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;\">✓</span>Avoid backsolving when answer choices are expressions, when algebra is simple, or when testing takes more work than solving\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;\">\n    <span style=\"color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;\">✓</span>This strategy can save 30-60 seconds per problem and reduces calculation errors on complex questions\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<!-- MASTERY QUIZ: Stored in database, NOT in HTML -->\n<!-- Create separately using quiz creation script -->\n",
