Chapter 18: Absolute Value
Absolute value is defined as a number’s distance from zero. Since a distance can never be negative,
the absolute value is always positive.

|3| = 3 (3 1s three units from zero)

|—3| = 3 (—3 is three units from zero)

For equations with absolute value bars, complete any math inside the absolute value bars first. Then,
solve the rest of the equation. For example, to solve
I3—7|+2
start by working inside the absolute value bars to get

|—4| + 2
|—4| = 4, so the equation becomes 4 + 2 = 6.

is the value of |2 + 11] — 2|3 —
A.

9

B.

13

C.

17

5|?

D. 22

Solution: We start by working inside the absolute value bars. The equation becomes
a = |13| — 2|-2|
|13| = 13 and |—2| = 2, so we get
a =13—-2(2)
a=9
The answer is A.

@) Absolute Value and Unknown Variables
What if there is a variable inside the absolute value bars? Let’s consider the equation below.

Ix -—3]=5

For any equation like this, there will be two answers. Since |5| = 5 and |—5| = 5, we need to solve for the
values of x when
x
—3

=5andx —3=—5.
x-3=5

x-3=-5

x=8

x=-2

Both x = —2 and x = 8 are correct answers.

Chapter 18: Absolute Value

For any question with an unknown variable inside the absolute value bars, there are multiple solutions.
To solve, we must get the absolute value bars on one side of the equation and all other terms on the other

side. There are four steps to solve these questions.
1.

Move all terms outside of the absolute value bars to the other side of the equation. First, add or
subtracting any constants outside of the absolute value bars.

2.

Next, divide or multiply any terms directly in front of the absolute value bars. After this step, we

should have the absolute value bar on one side of the equation by itself and all constants on the other
side.
3.

Set the term inside the absolute value bars equal to the positive value (1st equation) and negative
value (2nd equation) of the term(s) on the other side.

4.

Solve both equations to get the values of the unknown variable.

Example 2: What is the solution set to the equation 3|2x + 1|-—6 = 45?

A.

{-9}

B. {8}

C. {2, 8}

D. {-9, 8}

Solution: To solve, we need to move terms outside of the absolute value bars to the other side of the equation.
Here, we have the absolute value bars on the left side of the equation, so we will move all constants outside of
the absolute value bars to the right side.
We start with any constants outside of the absolute value bars that can be added or subtracted, which in this
case 1s the —6.
3|2x+1]|-—6=45
To move the —6 to the right side, we add 6 to both sides.
3|2x +1] =51
Next, we must move the 3 to the night side. We can do this by dividing both sides by 3 to get
|2x+1|=17
Now that the absolute value bars are on one side and the constants are on the other, we can solve by setting the
term inside the absolute value bar equal to +17 and —17 and solving both equations.
2x+1=17

2x+1=-17

2x = 16

2x
= —18

x=8

x=-9

We getx = 8 and
x = —9, so the answer is D.

Absolute Value and Inequalities
Absolute value with inequalities questions are the most difficult type of absolute value question you will face
on the ACT. Whenever solving these questions, the solution is an interval. To see how this works, let’s start
with a simple example:

Ix] <3
We need to find all x-values that are less than 3 units away from zero in either direction. On a number line,
this is all points that are less than +3 and greater than —3.

0

—3

o

x

3

The solution would be the interval —3 < x < 3. We do not include +3 or —3 because they are exactly 3
units from zero and not less than 3 units from zero.
What if instead we had

Ix] =>3
Now, we need to find all x-values that are greater than or equal to 3 units from zero in either direction. Ona
number line, this is all points that are less than or equal to —3 and greater than or equal to +3.

<

¢

|

—3

0

> x
3

The solution would be the interval x < —3 and x = 3. Here, we include the +3 and —3 because they are
exactly 3 units from zero.
For any questions with an unknown in the absolute value bars and an inequality, the solution is an

interval. There are 4 steps to solve these questions.
1.

Move all terms outside of the absolute value bars to the right side of the equation. For example,

given |x + 3| — 2 < 5, we need to add 2 to both sides to get |x + 3] < 7
2.

Determine where on a number line the inequality is true. For |x + 3| < 7, the value in the
absolute value bars, x + 3, must be greater than —7 and less than +7.

3.

Set the expression inside the absolute value bar in an inequality equation(s). For |x| < a or
|x| < a, set up the equation as —a

<x <aor—-—a<x <a. For |x| > aor |x| = 4, set up the

equation as x < —aand x > aorx < —aand x =a. For |x + 3| < 7, we set up our inequality
equations as -7
4.

<x +3 <7.

Solve the equations to get the intervals for the unknown variable. For —7 < x + 3 < 7, we solve
by subtracting 3 from all terms. The final answer is -10 < x < 4.

Example 3: The set of all values of x that satisfies |x + 3] — 4 < 1 is the same as the set of all values of
x that satisfies:

A.

0<x<2

B.0<x<5

C. -8<x<2

D. -8<x<5

Solution: First, we need to move all the terms outside of the absolute value bars to the right side. After
adding 4 to both sides, we get

Ix+3| <5
This tells us that x + 3 must be less than 5 units from zero, so on a number line x + 3 must be greater than —5

and less than +5. We can now set up the inequality and remove the absolute value bars:
—5<x+3<5

From here, we just do algebra. To get x by itself, we subtract 3 from all terms and get

-174-

Chapter 18: Absolute Value

—8<x<2
The answer is C.

Example 4: The set of all values of x that satisfies ox ar 2| > 3 is the same as the set of all values of x
that satisfies:
A.

x<-10andx>2

B.x<-S5Sandx>5

C.x<-10andx>0

D x>2

Solution: All of the numbers outside of the absolute value bars are already on the right side. The equation

tells us that =x + 2 must be greater than 3 units away from zero, so on a number line =x + 2 must be less than
—3 and greater than +3. We can now set up the inequalities and remove the absolute value bars:

=x+2<-3

and

<x+2>3

From here, we just do algebra. First, we need to subtract 2 from both sides to get

=x <—5

and

=x >1

x<-—10

and

x>2

Now, we multiply by 2 and get

The answer is A.
