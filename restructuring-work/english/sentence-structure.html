Understanding <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">sentence structure</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">clauses</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">fragments</strong>, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">run-on sentences</strong> is essential for ACT English success. These concepts appear in 12-15 questions per test—that's 20% of all English questions! This lesson will teach you how to identify complete sentences, recognize common errors like fragments and run-ons, and master the techniques to fix them quickly and confidently.

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. Independent and Dependent Clauses
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Every sentence is built from <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">clauses</strong>—groups of words containing a subject and verb. Understanding the difference between <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">independent clauses</strong> and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">dependent clauses</strong> is the foundation of sentence structure mastery.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Independent Clauses (Complete Thoughts)
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
An <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;"><span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="A complete sentence that can stand alone">independent clause</span></strong> expresses a complete thought and can stand alone as a sentence. It must have both a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">subject</strong> (who or what) and a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">predicate</strong> (what the subject does). Examples: "The dog barked." "She studied all night." "They won the championship." Each of these can stand alone and makes complete sense.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Dependent Clauses (Incomplete Thoughts)
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;"><span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="A sentence fragment that cannot stand alone">dependent clause</span></strong> has a subject and verb but cannot stand alone because it begins with a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">subordinating conjunction</strong> (because, although, when, if, since, while, etc.). Examples: "Because the dog barked." "Although she studied all night." "When they won the championship." These leave you hanging—you need more information to complete the thought.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Common Subordinating Conjunctions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Memorize these <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">subordinating conjunctions</strong> that create dependent clauses: after, although, as, because, before, even though, if, since, though, unless, until, when, whenever, where, whereas, wherever, while. If a clause starts with one of these words, it's dependent and CANNOT stand alone as a complete sentence.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Combining Clauses Correctly
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
A complete sentence needs at least one <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="A complete sentence that can stand alone">independent clause</span>. You can combine independent and dependent clauses: "She passed the test because she studied." (independent + dependent). You can also have two independent clauses joined properly: "She studied, and she passed the test." Understanding these combinations is crucial for avoiding fragments and run-ons.
</p>



<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Sentence Fragments and How to Fix Them
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">sentence fragment</strong> is an incomplete sentence—it's missing either a subject, a verb, or a complete thought. Fragments are one of the most common errors on the ACT English test. Learning to spot and fix them will significantly improve your score.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Missing Subject Fragments
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Some fragments lack a subject. Example: "Ran to the store." Who ran? The subject is missing. Fix: "She ran to the store." or "The children ran to the store." Always ask: Who or what is performing the action? If there's no answer, you have a fragment.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Missing Verb Fragments
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Other fragments lack a complete verb. Example: "The student studying all night." This has a subject (student) but "studying" is a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">participle</strong>, not a complete verb. Fix: "The student was studying all night." or "The student studied all night." Watch for -ing words without helping verbs (is, was, has been, etc.).
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Dependent Clause Fragments
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
The most common fragment is a <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="A sentence fragment that cannot stand alone">dependent clause</span> standing alone. Example: "Because she was tired." This has a subject (she) and verb (was) but it's incomplete because of "because." Fix option 1: Attach it to an <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="A complete sentence that can stand alone">independent clause</span>—"Because she was tired, she went to bed early." Fix option 2: Remove the subordinating conjunction—"She was tired."
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Phrase Fragments
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Phrases</strong> (groups of words without subject-verb combinations) cannot stand alone. Examples: "In the morning." "Running through the park." "To win the game." These are fragments. Fix them by attaching to a complete sentence: "In the morning, we ate breakfast." "Running through the park, she felt free." "To win the game, they practiced daily."
</p>



<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Run-On Sentences and Comma Splices
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;"><span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Two sentences incorrectly joined without punctuation">run-on sentence</span></strong> occurs when two independent clauses are joined incorrectly without proper punctuation or conjunctions. A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;"><span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Incorrectly joining two sentences with just a comma">comma splice</span></strong> is a specific type of run-on where two independent clauses are joined with only a comma. Both are serious errors that the ACT tests frequently.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Identifying Run-On Sentences
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Run-on example: "The concert was amazing the band played for three hours." This has two independent clauses ("The concert was amazing" and "the band played for three hours") jammed together with no separation. <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Incorrectly joining two sentences with just a comma">Comma splice</span> example: "The concert was amazing, the band played for three hours." The comma alone is insufficient to join two independent clauses.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Fix #1: Period (Two Sentences)
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
The simplest fix is to split the run-on into two separate sentences. "The concert was amazing. The band played for three hours." This works when the ideas are distinct. Use this fix when the clauses aren't closely related or when you want to add emphasis by creating a shorter, punchier sentence.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Fix #2: Semicolon
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;"><span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Punctuation (;) that joins two complete sentences">semicolon</span></strong> can join closely related independent clauses. "The concert was amazing; the band played for three hours." Semicolons work best when the two clauses are closely connected in meaning. Think of the <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Punctuation (;) that joins two complete sentences">semicolon</span> as saying "and here's more related information."
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Fix #3: Comma + Coordinating Conjunction
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Use a comma plus a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">coordinating conjunction</strong> (FANBOYS: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so). "The concert was amazing, and the band played for three hours." This is probably the most common fix. Remember: you need BOTH the comma AND the conjunction. Just a comma alone is a <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Incorrectly joining two sentences with just a comma">comma splice</span>!
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Fix #4: Make One Clause Dependent
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Turn one <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="A complete sentence that can stand alone">independent clause</span> into a <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="A sentence fragment that cannot stand alone">dependent clause</span> by adding a subordinating conjunction. "The concert was amazing because the band played for three hours." or "Although the band played for three hours, the concert was amazing." This fix works when one idea is the main point and the other provides supporting information.
</p>

4. Advanced Sentence Structures and Variety
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Beyond avoiding errors, effective writing uses varied sentence structures. The ACT tests your ability to recognize <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">simple</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">compound</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">complex</strong>, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">compound-complex</strong> sentences. Understanding these patterns helps you choose the most effective sentence structure.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Simple Sentences
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">simple sentence</strong> contains one <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="A complete sentence that can stand alone">independent clause</span>. Examples: "The dog barked." "Maria and Jose studied chemistry and physics." Even with multiple subjects or verbs, it's still simple if there's only one clause. Simple sentences are direct and powerful—use them for emphasis or to state clear facts.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Compound Sentences
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">compound sentence</strong> contains two or more independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (FANBOYS) or <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Punctuation (;) that joins two complete sentences">semicolon</span>. Example: "She loves reading, but he prefers movies." Both clauses could stand alone. Compound sentences show equal relationships between ideas.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Complex Sentences
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">complex sentence</strong> contains one <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="A complete sentence that can stand alone">independent clause</span> and at least one <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="A sentence fragment that cannot stand alone">dependent clause</span>. Example: "Because it was raining, we stayed inside." The <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="A sentence fragment that cannot stand alone">dependent clause</span> provides context or conditions. Complex sentences show how ideas relate in terms of cause, condition, time, or contrast.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Compound-Complex Sentences
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">compound-complex sentence</strong> contains two or more independent clauses AND at least one <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="A sentence fragment that cannot stand alone">dependent clause</span>. Example: "Although it was raining, we went to the park, and we had a great time." This structure combines multiple ideas with varying relationships. Use it when you need to express complex, interconnected thoughts.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Strategic Sentence Variety
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Good writing mixes sentence types for <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">rhythm</strong> and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">emphasis</strong>. A string of only simple sentences sounds choppy. All compound-complex sentences feel dense. The ACT sometimes asks you to choose revisions that improve sentence variety. Balance is key: use simple sentences for impact, compound for equal ideas, complex for showing relationships, and compound-complex sparingly when truly needed.
