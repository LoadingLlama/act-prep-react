<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Trends questions are among the most common question types on the ACT Science section, testing your ability to identify <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">directional relationships</strong> between variables, recognize <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">patterns in data</strong>, distinguish between <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">positive and negative correlations</strong>, and understand <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">linear versus non-linear relationships</strong>. These questions account for approximately 20-25% of all Science questions and require you to look at the big picture of how variables interact rather than focusing on specific data points. This lesson provides comprehensive strategies for quickly and accurately identifying trends in graphs and tables, explains the language used to describe different relationship types, teaches you how to avoid common misinterpretation errors, and shows you how to handle complex scenarios involving multiple variables or changing trends.

1. Recognizing and Describing Common Trend Types
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Understanding the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">standard vocabulary</strong> used to describe trends is essential for both identifying what questions ask and selecting correct answers. ACT Science uses specific language to describe different types of relationships between variables, and recognizing these patterns quickly improves both your speed and accuracy.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Positive (Direct) Relationships
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">positive relationship</strong>, also called a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">direct relationship</strong>, means that as one variable increases, the other variable also increases. Visually, this appears as an upward-sloping line or curve on a graph—moving from left to right, the line goes up. The ACT describes positive relationships using various phrases: "increased," "rose," "grew," "became greater," "showed a positive correlation," or "were directly related." For example, if a graph shows that as temperature increases from 20°C to 80°C, reaction rate increases from 2 mol/s to 10 mol/s, this is a positive relationship. Questions might ask: "As temperature increased, reaction rate:" with the correct answer being "increased" or "showed a positive correlation." When you see an upward trend on any graph, mentally note it as a positive relationship. This is one of the most common trend types you'll encounter, particularly in chemistry and physics passages involving energy, temperature, or concentration effects.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Negative (Inverse) Relationships
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">negative relationship</strong>, also called an <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">inverse relationship</strong>, means that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases. Visually, this appears as a downward-sloping line or curve—moving from left to right, the line goes down. The ACT describes negative relationships with phrases like: "decreased," "declined," "fell," "became smaller," "showed a negative correlation," "were inversely related," or "showed an inverse relationship." For example, if a graph shows that as altitude increases from 0 to 10,000 meters, atmospheric pressure decreases from 101 kPa to 30 kPa, this is a negative relationship. Questions might ask: "Based on Figure 2, as altitude increased, atmospheric pressure:" with the correct answer being "decreased" or "showed an inverse relationship." Inverse relationships are extremely common in physics (like pressure-volume relationships in gases) and biology (like predator-prey population dynamics). When you see a downward trend, mentally label it as a negative or inverse relationship.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
No Relationship (Constant or Independent)
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Sometimes two variables show <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">no relationship</strong>, meaning changes in one variable don't affect the other. Visually, this often appears as a horizontal line (the dependent variable stays constant regardless of changes in the independent variable) or as scattered points with no clear pattern. The ACT describes this with phrases like: "remained constant," "stayed the same," "did not change," "showed no correlation," "were independent," or "was not affected by." For example, if a graph shows that as pH increases from 3 to 9, the mass of a substance remains at 50 grams throughout, pH and mass have no relationship. Questions might ask: "Based on the data, how did changing pH affect mass?" with the correct answer being "Mass remained constant" or "pH did not affect mass." Recognizing when variables are independent is important for experimental design questions and for eliminating incorrect answer choices that claim a relationship exists when the data shows none.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Linear vs. Non-Linear Relationships
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Beyond direction (positive, negative, or none), relationships can also be described by their <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">shape</strong>. A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">linear relationship</strong> forms a straight line, indicating a constant rate of change—each unit increase in the independent variable causes the same amount of change in the dependent variable. The ACT might describe this as "linear," "proportional," or "constant rate of change." A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">non-linear relationship</strong> forms a curve, indicating a changing rate of change. Common non-linear patterns include <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">exponential growth</strong> (rate of increase accelerates), <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">logarithmic growth</strong> (rate of increase decelerates), <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">exponential decay</strong> (rate of decrease accelerates), and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">parabolic relationships</strong> (increases then decreases, or vice versa). While you don't need to know the mathematical details, recognizing whether a trend is straight or curved helps you answer questions accurately. Questions might ask whether a relationship is "linear" or whether the "rate of change was constant," requiring you to assess the line's shape.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Identifying Trend Types</strong><br><br>
<strong>Positive Relationship:</strong> Graph shows temperature on x-axis (0-100°C) and volume on y-axis (0-200 mL). Line slopes upward from bottom-left to top-right → As temperature increased, volume increased<br><br>
<strong>Negative Relationship:</strong> Graph shows pressure on x-axis (0-5 atm) and volume on y-axis (200-0 mL). Line slopes downward from top-left to bottom-right → As pressure increased, volume decreased (inverse relationship)<br><br>
<strong>No Relationship:</strong> Graph shows time on x-axis (0-60 min) and mass on y-axis (consistently 50 g). Horizontal line → Mass remained constant; time did not affect mass<br><br>
<strong>Linear:</strong> Straight line relationship → Constant rate of change<br>
<strong>Non-linear:</strong> Curved relationship → Rate of change varies
</p>

2. Strategies for Quickly Identifying Trends in Graphs
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Developing efficient strategies for <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">visual trend recognition</strong> allows you to answer trend questions in 10-20 seconds rather than 30-45 seconds. These techniques help you quickly assess relationships without needing to read specific data points.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
The Left-to-Right Scanning Method
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
The fastest way to identify trends in line graphs is the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">left-to-right scan</strong>: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Identify which variable is on the x-axis</strong> (the one you're told "increased" or "changed"). (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Starting from the left side of the graph</strong>, visually trace the line or curve as you move right. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Note whether the line goes up</strong> (positive relationship), <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">goes down</strong> (negative relationship), or <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">stays flat</strong> (no relationship). (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Match this pattern to the answer choices</strong>. This entire process takes 5-10 seconds with practice. You don't need to read any specific values or examine the axes carefully—just identify the overall direction. For example, if a question asks "As time increased, temperature:" you scan the graph left to right and see the line goes up, so you immediately know the answer involves "increased" without needing to check exact numbers.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Comparing Start and End Points
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Another quick technique is <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">comparing endpoints</strong>: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Look at the y-value at the leftmost point</strong> on the line (the starting value of the dependent variable). (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Look at the y-value at the rightmost point</strong> on the line (the ending value). (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Compare them</strong>: If the ending value is higher, it's a positive relationship. If the ending value is lower, it's a negative relationship. If they're the same, there's no relationship. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Select the corresponding answer</strong>. For example, if the line starts at y = 10 on the left and ends at y = 50 on the right, the y-variable increased as x increased (positive relationship). This method is particularly useful when graphs have complex curves or multiple fluctuations—you can ignore the middle details and just focus on whether the net change is up, down, or flat. However, be careful with this method if the question asks about a specific portion of the graph rather than the overall trend.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Identifying Trends in Tables
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
For <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">data tables</strong>, identify trends by: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Locating the independent variable column/row</strong> (the one that was systematically changed) and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">the dependent variable column/row</strong> (the one that was measured). (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Reading down or across</strong> to see how the dependent variable changes as the independent variable changes. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Noting whether values increase, decrease, or stay constant</strong>. For example, if a table shows temperature in the first column (10°C, 20°C, 30°C, 40°C) and reaction rate in the second column (2, 5, 11, 20), you can see that as temperature increases, reaction rate increases—a positive relationship. The values don't need to be perfectly linear; as long as the general pattern is upward, it's a positive trend. Similarly, if values go 100, 75, 50, 25 as the independent variable increases, that's a negative trend. Tables often require this row-by-row or column-by-column comparison to identify patterns.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Using Answer Choices to Guide Your Analysis
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Trends questions often have predictable <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">answer choice patterns</strong> that help you know what to look for. Common patterns include: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Directional pairs</strong>: "increased" vs. "decreased," allowing you to quickly scan for up or down. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Relationship descriptors</strong>: "direct relationship" vs. "inverse relationship" vs. "no relationship." (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Comparative trends</strong>: "increased then decreased," "decreased then increased," "remained constant then increased." Once you read the answer choices, you know exactly what to look for in the figure. For example, if answer choices are "increased," "decreased," "remained constant," and "increased then decreased," you immediately know to check the overall direction and whether there are any changes in direction. This focused analysis is faster than examining the graph without a clear objective. Always preview answer choices before studying the figure in detail to guide your analysis efficiently.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Quick Trend Identification</strong><br><br>
<strong>Question:</strong> "As concentration increased from 0.1 M to 0.5 M, absorbance:"<br>
<strong>Answer choices:</strong> A) increased only, B) decreased only, C) remained constant, D) increased then decreased<br><br>
<strong>Strategy:</strong><br>
1. Preview answer choices → Looking for direction and whether it changes<br>
2. Find concentration axis and absorbance axis on graph<br>
3. Scan left-to-right (low to high concentration)<br>
4. Observe line goes steadily upward → No direction changes<br>
5. Select "A) increased only"<br><br>
<strong>Time:</strong> 15 seconds<br><br>
This focused approach is much faster than reading specific values.

3. Common Pitfalls in Trends Questions
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Despite being conceptually straightforward, trends questions often cause errors through <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">careless misreading</strong> of either the question or the graph. Understanding these common pitfalls helps you avoid preventable mistakes that cost points.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Pitfall #1: Reversing the Cause and Effect Variables
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
The most common error is <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">confusing which variable changed and which responded</strong>. A question asks "As temperature increased, pressure:" but you accidentally analyze how temperature changed when pressure increased (the reverse relationship). This happens when you don't carefully identify which variable is the independent (cause) and which is the dependent (effect). To prevent this: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Circle or underline</strong> the independent variable mentioned in the question (the one that "increased" or "changed"). (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Identify which variable you need to describe</strong> (the one after the <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Punctuation (:) that introduces a list or explanation">colon</span> or in the answer choices). (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Find the independent variable on the graph</strong> (usually x-axis but not always) and trace to see how the dependent variable (usually y-axis) responded. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Verify your reading</strong> makes sense: if the question says temperature "increased," make sure you're looking at the trend as you move toward higher temperature values, not lower ones.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Pitfall #2: Confusing "Increased" with "Decreased"
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Even when you correctly identify the trend, it's surprisingly easy to <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">select the opposite answer</strong> by mixing up "increased" and "decreased." You see the line going up and correctly think "positive relationship," but then accidentally select "decreased" because you're working quickly and your eyes landed on the wrong word. This type of error is particularly frustrating because you understood the science but made a reading mistake. To prevent this: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Slow down</strong> when reading answer choices—these questions are quick, so taking an extra 2-3 seconds won't hurt your pacing. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Verbalize</strong> the trend mentally or under your breath: "The line goes up, so it increased." (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Double-check</strong> your selected answer before moving on: Does "increased" match the upward trend I saw? This verification step catches most reversal errors before they cost you points.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Pitfall #3: Missing Direction Changes or Exceptions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Some trends questions ask about <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">non-monotonic relationships</strong> where the direction changes. For example, a variable might increase at first, then decrease, or vice versa. If you only look at the beginning of the graph or just compare endpoints, you might miss these direction changes. Questions might ask: "As X increased, Y:" with answer choices like "increased only," "decreased only," "increased then decreased," or "decreased then increased." To handle these: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Scan the entire range</strong> of the graph from left to right, not just the endpoints. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Look for turning points</strong> where the line changes from going up to going down (or vice versa). (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check the answer choices</strong> to see if any mention direction changes—if they do, examine the graph more carefully for changes. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Verify the full range</strong>: if the question asks about X increasing from 0 to 100, make sure you examine the entire range, not just 0 to 50.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Pitfall #4: Describing Weak or Noisy Trends Incorrectly
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Some graphs show <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">weak trends</strong> with lots of fluctuation or <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">scatter</strong> in the data. For example, values might go 10, 12, 11, 15, 14, 18, 17, 21—there's an overall upward trend, but it's not smooth. Students sometimes see the fluctuations and incorrectly select "remained constant" or "showed no pattern" when the answer should be "increased" based on the overall trend. To handle noisy data: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Focus on the overall pattern</strong> rather than point-to-point changes. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Compare the beginning and end</strong> to determine the net direction. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Look for trend lines</strong> if provided—some graphs include a "line of best fit" that shows the average trend through scattered points. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Trust the general direction</strong>: if values are generally higher at the end than the beginning despite some fluctuations, it's still an increasing trend. The ACT typically makes trends clear enough that you can identify the dominant pattern even with some noise.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Avoiding Pitfalls</strong><br><br>
<strong>Pitfall 1 Prevention:</strong> Question: "As pressure increased, temperature:" → Circle "pressure" (independent variable I'm tracking) and identify "temperature" (dependent variable I'm describing) → Verify I'm looking at how temperature responds to pressure changes, not vice versa<br><br>
<strong>Pitfall 2 Prevention:</strong> I see the line goes upward → Mentally state "increased" → Look at answer choices carefully → Select "increased" not "decreased" → Verify: upward = increased ✓<br><br>
<strong>Pitfall 3 Prevention:</strong> Question: "As time increased from 0 to 60 min, pH:" → Scan entire time range 0-60 → Notice pH increases from 0-30 min, then decreases from 30-60 min → Select "increased then decreased"<br><br>
<strong>Pitfall 4 Prevention:</strong> See scattered points with fluctuations → Compare overall: starting value ≈ 15, ending value ≈ 45 → Net change is upward → Select "increased" despite fluctuations
</p>

4. Advanced Trend Analysis: Multiple Variables and Comparisons
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
More complex trend questions require you to <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">compare trends across conditions</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">analyze multiple variables simultaneously</strong>, or <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">determine which factor has the greatest effect</strong>. These questions test higher-order analytical skills but can still be answered systematically.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Comparing Trends Across Different Conditions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Some questions ask you to <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">compare how the same variable behaves under different conditions</strong>. For example: "How did the relationship between temperature and reaction rate differ for Enzyme A versus Enzyme B?" or "In which trial did pressure have the greatest effect on volume?" To answer these: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Identify the conditions being compared</strong> (different enzymes, different trials, different pH levels, etc.). (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Locate the corresponding lines or datasets</strong> in the figure using the legend. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Analyze the trend for each condition separately</strong>: Does it increase, decrease, or stay constant? (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Compare the trends</strong>: Are they the same direction? Do they differ in magnitude or rate? Which shows a steeper slope (greater effect)? For example, if both enzymes show increasing reaction rates with temperature, but Enzyme A's line is steeper, then temperature has a greater effect on Enzyme A. This type of comparative analysis requires you to look at multiple datasets within a single figure.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Determining Which Factor Has the Greatest Effect
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Questions might ask <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">which variable or condition caused the largest change</strong> in an outcome. For example: "Based on the three experiments, which factor had the greatest effect on growth rate?" To answer: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Identify what's being measured</strong> (the outcome variable—in this case, growth rate). (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">For each condition/experiment</strong>, determine the range or magnitude of change in the outcome. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Compare these ranges</strong>: Which condition caused the biggest difference between minimum and maximum values? (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Select the factor associated with the largest change</strong>. For example, if changing temperature caused growth rate to go from 2 to 8 cm/day (range of 6), changing light caused it to go from 4 to 6 cm/day (range of 2), and changing water caused it to go from 3 to 10 cm/day (range of 7), then water had the greatest effect. This requires quantitative comparison of magnitude, not just direction.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Identifying Which Variable Affects Another
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Some questions ask you to <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">determine whether a specific variable affects an outcome</strong> by checking whether there's a relationship. For example: "Based on Table 1, did pH affect reaction rate?" To answer: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Locate the two variables in the table or graph</strong>. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check whether the outcome variable changes</strong> as the potential causal variable changes. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">If there's a clear trend</strong> (positive or negative), then yes, it affects the outcome. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">If the outcome stays constant</strong> despite changes in the potential causal variable, then no, it doesn't affect the outcome. For example, if pH changes from 3 to 9 but reaction rate stays at 5 mol/s throughout, then pH did not affect reaction rate. Conversely, if reaction rate changes from 2 to 10 mol/s as pH changes, then pH did affect it. This type of question tests your understanding of what constitutes evidence of a relationship versus independence.

Analyzing Trends Across Multiple Figures
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
The most complex trend questions require you to <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">synthesize information from multiple figures</strong>. For example: "Based on Figures 1 and 2, which conclusion about the relationship between variables X, Y, and Z is supported?" To answer these: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Examine each figure separately</strong> and identify the trend it shows. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Look for connections</strong> between the figures: Do they show related variables? Do trends in one figure help explain trends in another? (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Synthesize the information</strong>: What can you conclude when considering both sets of data together? (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;"><span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Cross out wrong answer choices">Eliminate</span> answer choices</strong> that contradict either figure or that aren't supported by the combined evidence. For example, if Figure 1 shows X increases with time and Figure 2 shows Y increases with time, you might conclude X and Y both increase together (positive relationship between X and Y). These multi-figure questions take longer but can be broken down into manageable steps by analyzing one figure at a time before synthesizing.

<strong>Example: Advanced Trend Comparison</strong><br><br>
<strong>Question:</strong> "Based on Figure 3, which enzyme showed the greatest increase in activity as temperature increased from 20°C to 60°C?"<br><br>
<strong>Analysis:</strong><br>
- Figure shows 3 lines: Enzyme A, Enzyme B, Enzyme C<br>
- At 20°C: A = 10 units, B = 15 units, C = 5 units<br>
- At 60°C: A = 40 units, B = 25 units, C = 30 units<br>
- Change for A: 40 - 10 = 30 units<br>
- Change for B: 25 - 15 = 10 units<br>
- Change for C: 30 - 5 = 25 units<br>
- Greatest increase: Enzyme A (30 units)<br><br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> Enzyme A<br><br>
This requires comparing magnitudes of change, not just directions.
