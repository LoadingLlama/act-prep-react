Math-on-science questions test your ability to <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">perform calculations using scientific data</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">apply mathematical formulas in scientific contexts</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">convert between units and scales</strong>, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">manipulate numerical information from tables and graphs</strong>. Unlike pure data reading questions, these require actual computation—calculating averages, percentages, rates, ratios, or applying given formulas with values from the passage. This lesson teaches you efficient calculation strategies for common ACT science math scenarios, explains how to extract and organize numerical data before computing, provides techniques for managing units and conversions, and shows you how to estimate and check answers to avoid calculation errors under time pressure.

1. Common Calculation Types in ACT Science
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Understanding the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">types of calculations</strong> that frequently appear helps you recognize what's being asked and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">select the right approach</strong> quickly.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Averages, Means, and Totals
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Average calculations</strong> are among the most common: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Mean (arithmetic average)</strong>: Sum all values and divide by the count. If three trials gave 12, 15, and 18, the mean is (12 + 15 + 18)/3 = 45/3 = 15. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Finding totals</strong>: Sometimes questions ask for the sum across conditions. If Trial 1 produced 5 g, Trial 2 produced 8 g, and Trial 3 produced 7 g, the total is 20 g. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Weighted averages</strong>: Occasionally, different values should contribute differently to the average based on their frequency or importance. If 60% of samples measured 10 and 40% measured 15, the weighted average is (0.6×10) + (0.4×15) = 6 + 6 = 12. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Common errors</strong>: Make sure you count the number of values correctly. If a table shows 5 rows of data, the average divides by 5, not 4. Also, be clear on what to average—sometimes it's raw values, sometimes it's calculated values from each trial. The question "What was the average growth rate across the three conditions?" means calculate growth rate for each condition, then average those three rates.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Percentages, Ratios, and Proportions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Percentage questions</strong> ask you to express relationships as percents: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Percent of total</strong>: (Part/Whole) × 100%. If 15 out of 60 plants survived, the survival rate is (15/60) × 100% = 25%. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Percent change</strong>: [(New - Old)/Old] × 100%. If temperature increased from 50°C to 65°C, the percent increase is [(65-50)/50] × 100% = (15/50) × 100% = 30%. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Ratios</strong>: Express as a fraction or simplified form. If 20 mL of A reacts with 30 mL of B, the ratio is 20:30 = 2:3. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Proportions</strong>: If the ratio of X to Y is 3:5 and there are 15 units of X, then Y = (5/3) × 15 = 25 units. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Common errors</strong>: For percent change, make sure "Old" is in the denominator. A change from 100 to 150 is +50%, but a change from 150 to 100 is -33.3% (not -50%). Also, when finding percent of total, ensure you're dividing by the correct total—sometimes it's a subtotal, not the grand total.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Rates, Slopes, and Change Over Time
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Rate calculations</strong> determine how quickly something changes: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Rate = Change / Time</strong>: If a plant grew from 5 cm to 20 cm in 3 days, the growth rate is (20-5)/3 = 5 cm/day. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Slope calculation from graphs</strong>: Slope = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁). Choose two clear points on a line. If (0, 10) and (5, 30) are on the line, slope = (30-10)/(5-0) = 20/5 = 4. The units are y-units per x-unit. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Rate units</strong>: Pay attention to units. Miles per hour, grams per second, degrees per minute—the denominator tells you the "per what" part. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Average rate vs. instantaneous rate</strong>: ACT questions typically ask for average rates over an interval. If speed was 40 mph for the first hour and 60 mph for the second hour, the average is 50 mph (assuming equal time intervals). (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Negative rates</strong>: A decrease gives a negative rate. If temperature drops from 80°C to 50°C in 10 minutes, the rate is (50-80)/10 = -3°C/min. The negative sign indicates decrease. Rates are fundamental to science—velocity, reaction rate, cooling rate, growth rate, etc.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Applying Given Formulas with Data
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Many questions provide a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">formula</strong> and ask you to calculate using passage data: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Identify variables</strong>: Match each variable in the formula to a value from the passage. The passage might say "pressure (P) was 2 atm, volume (V) was 5 L, and temperature (T) was 300 K" and give you PV = nRT. Identify that P = 2, V = 5, T = 300, R = 0.082 (given), and solve for n. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Substitute carefully</strong>: Write out the formula, substitute numbers with units, then calculate. This prevents mixing up variables. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Rearrange if needed</strong>: If the formula is given as y = 2x + 3 and you need to find x when y = 15, rearrange: 15 = 2x + 3 → 12 = 2x → x = 6. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check units</strong>: After calculating, verify units make sense. If calculating speed and getting "5 meters," that's wrong—speed needs distance/time units. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Common formulas</strong>: Density = mass/volume, Speed = distance/time, Concentration = moles/volume. Even if not explicitly given, you're expected to know these basic relationships. Formula questions are straightforward if you substitute correctly and perform arithmetic carefully.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Common Calculations</strong><br><br>
<strong>Average:</strong> Three trials measured pH values of 6.2, 6.8, and 7.0<br>
Average pH = (6.2 + 6.8 + 7.0)/3 = 20.0/3 = 6.67<br><br>
<strong>Percentage:</strong> 24 out of 80 seeds germinated<br>
Percent germination = (24/80) × 100% = 0.3 × 100% = 30%<br><br>
<strong>Percent change:</strong> Mass increased from 50 g to 72 g<br>
Percent increase = [(72-50)/50] × 100% = (22/50) × 100% = 44%<br><br>
<strong>Rate:</strong> Object moved 120 meters in 15 seconds<br>
Speed = 120 m / 15 s = 8 m/s<br><br>
<strong>Slope:</strong> Graph shows points (2, 10) and (6, 30)<br>
Slope = (30-10)/(6-2) = 20/4 = 5 (units: y per x)<br><br>
<strong>Formula application:</strong> Density = mass/volume, mass = 45 g, volume = 15 mL<br>
Density = 45/15 = 3 g/mL

2. Unit Conversions and Scale Manipulations
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Many ACT science calculations require <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">converting between units</strong> or <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">working across different measurement scales</strong>.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Metric System Conversions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Metric prefixes</strong> create different unit sizes: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Common prefixes</strong>: kilo (k) = 10³ = 1000, centi (c) = 10⁻² = 0.01, milli (m) = 10⁻³ = 0.001, micro (μ) = 10⁻⁶ = 0.000001, nano (n) = 10⁻⁹. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Conversion method</strong>: Multiply by the conversion factor. To convert 3.5 km to meters: 3.5 km × 1000 m/km = 3500 m. To convert 250 mg to grams: 250 mg × 0.001 g/mg = 0.25 g. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Direction trick</strong>: From larger units to smaller units, multiply. From smaller to larger, divide. 5 kg to grams (larger to smaller): 5 × 1000 = 5000 g. 800 mL to liters (smaller to larger): 800 ÷ 1000 = 0.8 L. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Common conversions</strong>: 1 km = 1000 m, 1 m = 100 cm = 1000 mm, 1 L = 1000 mL, 1 g = 1000 mg, 1 kg = 1000 g. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Scientific notation</strong>: 1 km = 10³ m, 1 mg = 10⁻³ g. This helps with very large or small numbers. Metric conversions are straightforward if you know the prefixes and multiply by the right factor.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Temperature Scale Conversions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Temperature conversions</strong> between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Celsius to Kelvin</strong>: K = °C + 273 (or more precisely, + 273.15). 25°C = 25 + 273 = 298 K. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Kelvin to Celsius</strong>: °C = K - 273. 350 K = 350 - 273 = 77°C. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Celsius to Fahrenheit</strong>: °F = (9/5)×°C + 32. 20°C = (9/5)×20 + 32 = 36 + 32 = 68°F. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Fahrenheit to Celsius</strong>: °C = (5/9)×(°F - 32). 86°F = (5/9)×(86-32) = (5/9)×54 = 30°C. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Key reference points</strong>: Water freezes at 0°C = 32°F = 273 K. Water boils at 100°C = 212°F = 373 K. Room temperature ≈ 20-25°C ≈ 68-77°F ≈ 293-298 K. (6) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Temperature changes</strong>: A change of 1°C equals a change of 1 K (same size degree). But a change of 1°C equals a change of 1.8°F (different size degree). For converting temperature differences (not absolute temperatures), ΔK = Δ°C and Δ°F = 1.8 × Δ°C. The ACT rarely requires Fahrenheit conversions but often uses Celsius and Kelvin interchangeably in science passages.

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Compound Units and Dimensional Analysis
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Compound units</strong> involve multiple dimensions: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Speed conversions</strong>: Convert m/s to km/h. 20 m/s = 20 m/s × (1 km/1000 m) × (3600 s/1 h) = 20 × 3600/1000 km/h = 72 km/h. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Density conversions</strong>: Convert g/mL to kg/L. 1.5 g/mL = 1.5 g/mL × (1 kg/1000 g) × (1000 mL/1 L) = 1.5 × 1000/1000 = 1.5 kg/L. Actually, g/mL = kg/L directly (1 g/mL = 1 kg/L). (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Dimensional analysis method</strong>: Set up conversions so units cancel. To convert 50 mg/dL to g/L: 50 mg/dL × (1 g/1000 mg) × (10 dL/1 L) = 50 × 10/1000 g/L = 0.5 g/L. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Area and volume conversions</strong>: When squaring or cubing, apply the conversion factor to each dimension. 1 m² = (100 cm)² = 10,000 cm². 1 m³ = (100 cm)³ = 1,000,000 cm³. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Strategy</strong>: Write out units explicitly during conversions. If units don't cancel to give the desired result, you've set up the conversion incorrectly. The ACT tests whether you can correctly chain conversion factors to get from one unit system to another.

Scientific Notation and Order of Magnitude
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Scientific notation</strong> expresses very large or small numbers: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Format</strong>: a × 10ⁿ where 1 ≤ a &lt; 10 and n is an integer. 3,500,000 = 3.5 × 10⁶. 0.00042 = 4.2 × 10⁻⁴. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Multiplication</strong>: Multiply the coefficients and add the exponents. (2 × 10³) × (3 × 10⁵) = 6 × 10⁸. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Division</strong>: Divide coefficients and subtract exponents. (8 × 10⁷) ÷ (2 × 10³) = 4 × 10⁴. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Addition/subtraction</strong>: Convert to the same exponent first. (3 × 10⁴) + (2 × 10³) = (3 × 10⁴) + (0.2 × 10⁴) = 3.2 × 10⁴. Or convert: 30,000 + 2,000 = 32,000 = 3.2 × 10⁴. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Order of magnitude</strong>: The exponent indicates the scale. 10⁶ is a million, 10⁹ is a billion, 10⁻⁹ is a billionth (nano). Comparing orders of magnitude helps estimate: 5 × 10⁷ is about 50 million, much larger than 3 × 10⁴ (thirty thousand). (6) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ACT usage</strong>: Scientific notation appears in astronomy (distances), microbiology (cell sizes), chemistry (molecular quantities). You need to compare, add, or convert these numbers confidently.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Unit Conversions</strong><br><br>
<strong>Metric:</strong> Convert 2.5 km to meters<br>
2.5 km × 1000 m/km = 2500 m<br><br>
<strong>Temperature:</strong> Convert 37°C to Kelvin<br>
K = 37 + 273 = 310 K<br><br>
<strong>Temperature difference:</strong> Temperature rose from 20°C to 45°C. What is the change in Kelvin?<br>
ΔT = 45 - 20 = 25°C = 25 K (same magnitude for temperature changes)<br><br>
<strong>Compound units:</strong> Convert 15 m/s to km/h<br>
15 m/s × (1 km/1000 m) × (3600 s/1 h) = 15 × 3.6 km/h = 54 km/h<br><br>
<strong>Scientific notation:</strong> Multiply (4 × 10⁵) × (3 × 10⁻²)<br>
= (4 × 3) × (10⁵ × 10⁻²) = 12 × 10³ = 1.2 × 10⁴<br><br>
<strong>Density conversion:</strong> 2.7 g/cm³ to kg/m³<br>
2.7 g/cm³ × (1 kg/1000 g) × (10⁶ cm³/1 m³) = 2.7 × 1000 kg/m³ = 2700 kg/m³

3. Extracting and Organizing Data for Calculations
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Before calculating, you must accurately <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">locate and extract</strong> the necessary numerical information from <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">complex tables, graphs, and text</strong>.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Reading Values from Tables Accurately
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Table reading</strong> requires careful alignment: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Identify row and column headers</strong>: Understand what each row and column represents. Headers often include units. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Trace carefully</strong>: Use your finger or pencil to trace from the row label to the column label, finding the intersection. A table showing "Temperature" in rows and "Pressure" in columns: to find pressure at 50°C, find the 50°C row, then move across to the desired column. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Watch for units in headers</strong>: If the column header says "Mass (g)", all values in that column are in grams—don't add "g" again or convert unnecessarily. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Multi-level headers</strong>: Some tables have grouped columns. Make sure you're reading from the correct sub-column under the main category. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Missing or unclear values</strong>: If a cell says "—" or is blank, it typically means no data or not applicable. Don't assume it's zero. (6) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Common error</strong>: Reading the wrong row or column due to rushing. Double-check you're on the correct line, especially in dense tables with many rows.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Extracting Values from Graphs for Calculations
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Graph reading</strong> for math questions: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Read axis scales carefully</strong>: Check the increment size. If gridlines are every 10 units and a point is 3 gridlines up, that's 30 units, not 3. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Estimate when necessary</strong>: If a point falls between gridlines, estimate its value. Between 40 and 50, halfway would be 45. Don't worry about extreme precision—ACT answer choices have enough separation. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">For slope calculations, choose convenient points</strong>: Pick points on gridline intersections for easier reading. Avoid points that require estimation unless necessary. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">For areas under curves or bar heights</strong>: Use the scale to convert visual height to numerical value. A bar reaching the "60" line represents a value of 60 (in whatever units the axis shows). (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Multiple data series</strong>: Make sure you're reading the correct line or bar set if the graph shows multiple variables. Check the legend. (6) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Units</strong>: The axis label includes units. If y-axis says "Speed (m/s)", the value 20 means 20 m/s. Include units in your calculation setup.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Organizing Information Before Calculating
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Organization prevents errors</strong>: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">List known values with units</strong>: Before plugging into a formula, write out what you know. "Mass = 25 g, Volume = 5 mL, Density = ?" This clarifies what you're solving for. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Write the formula or calculation method</strong>: State the relationship. "Density = Mass/Volume". Then substitute: "Density = 25 g / 5 mL = 5 g/mL". (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Keep units throughout</strong>: Include units at each step. They help catch errors (if units don't work out, you did something wrong) and remind you what the number represents. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">For multi-step calculations, work sequentially</strong>: Calculate intermediate values first. If finding average rate and you need to calculate individual rates first, do those calculations, write down results, then average. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Use scratch space efficiently</strong>: The ACT provides scratch paper. Don't try to do complex calculations mentally. Write out steps to avoid arithmetic mistakes. Organized work is faster and more accurate than rushing through mentally.

Dealing with Data Presented in Text
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Sometimes numerical data is <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">embedded in sentences</strong>: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Underline or circle numbers as you read</strong>: "The reaction occurred at 75°C and produced 3.2 grams of product in 15 minutes." Mark 75, 3.2, and 15 so you can find them quickly when calculating. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Note units immediately</strong>: As you mark numbers, note their units. "75°C", "3.2 g", "15 min". This prevents confusion later. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Watch for multiple values of the same variable</strong>: "Trial 1 used 10 mL while Trial 2 used 25 mL." Make sure you're using the correct value for the trial in question. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Definitions and given values</strong>: "Let R = 8.314 J/(mol·K)" or "The specific heat of aluminum is 0.9 J/(g·°C)" provides constants. Note these for later use. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Calculated vs. measured</strong>: Sometimes text says "the calculated value was X" versus "the measured value was Y". Make sure you use the right one for the question being asked. Reading data from text requires active engagement—marking and annotating prevents missing crucial numbers.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Extracting and Organizing Data</strong><br><br>
<strong>Scenario:</strong> A table shows Temperature (°C) in column 1 and Volume (mL) in column 2. At 25°C, volume is 150 mL. At 75°C, volume is 200 mL. Calculate the average rate of volume change per degree Celsius.<br><br>
<strong>Step 1 - Extract data:</strong><br>
Initial: T₁ = 25°C, V₁ = 150 mL<br>
Final: T₂ = 75°C, V₂ = 200 mL<br><br>
<strong>Step 2 - Calculate changes:</strong><br>
ΔT = 75 - 25 = 50°C<br>
ΔV = 200 - 150 = 50 mL<br><br>
<strong>Step 3 - Calculate rate:</strong><br>
Rate = ΔV / ΔT = 50 mL / 50°C = 1 mL/°C<br><br>
<strong>Step 4 - Verify:</strong><br>
Units are correct (mL per °C = volume change per temperature change ✓)<br>
Rate is positive (volume increased as temperature increased ✓)<br><br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> The average rate of volume change is 1 mL/°C

4. Estimation, Checking, and Avoiding Calculation Errors
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Under time pressure, you need strategies to <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">calculate efficiently</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">estimate when appropriate</strong>, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">catch errors</strong> before selecting answers.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Using Estimation to Narrow Answer Choices
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Estimation</strong> can <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Cross out wrong answer choices">eliminate</span> wrong answers quickly: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Round numbers for mental math</strong>: If calculating 48.7 × 3.1, round to 50 × 3 = 150. This estimates the answer is around 150 (actual: 151.0). If answer choices are 15, 150, 1500, 15000, you know it's 150. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Order of magnitude check</strong>: Is the answer in the tens, hundreds, thousands? This eliminates wildly wrong choices. If calculating 0.003 × 500, estimate 0.003 ≈ 0.005 and 0.005 × 500 = 2.5. Actual is 1.5, so order of magnitude is "ones". <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Cross out wrong answer choices">Eliminate</span> any answer in tens or tenths. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Percentage estimation</strong>: 17 out of 78 is close to 20 out of 80 = 20/80 = 25%. Actual is 21.8%, but 25% is close enough to <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Cross out wrong answer choices">eliminate</span> choices like 12% or 45%. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Ratio reasoning</strong>: If calculating a fraction, determine if it's close to 0, close to 1, or in between. 495/510 is very close to 1 (both numbers nearly equal). 12/487 is very close to 0 (tiny numerator). Use this to <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Cross out wrong answer choices">eliminate</span> unreasonable answers. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">When to estimate vs. calculate exactly</strong>: If answer choices are far apart (e.g., 2, 20, 200, 2000), estimation suffices. If they're close (e.g., 3.2, 3.5, 3.8, 4.1), calculate precisely.

Common Calculation Errors and How to Avoid Them
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Frequent mistakes</strong> and prevention: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Arithmetic errors</strong>: Misadding, wrong multiplication, incorrect division. Prevention: Write out calculations clearly. Double-check mental math for multi-digit numbers. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Order of operations</strong>: Calculate 5 + 3 × 4 as 17 (not 32). Remember PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division (left to right), Addition/Subtraction (left to right). (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Sign errors</strong>: Subtracting a negative becomes addition. 10 - (-3) = 13. Or calculating percent decrease: use (New - Old)/Old, which gives a negative percent for decreases. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Decimal point placement</strong>: 0.5 × 6 = 3.0 (not 30 or 0.3). Count decimal places: 0.5 (one place) × 6 (zero places) = product has one decimal place. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Unit errors</strong>: Forgetting to convert units before calculating. If mass is in kg and volume in mL, convert one so both use compatible units. (6) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Formula inversion</strong>: Using speed = time/distance instead of speed = distance/time. Write formulas clearly before substituting. (7) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Prevention strategy</strong>: Work systematically, write steps, and use estimation to verify your calculated answer is in the right ballpark.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Reasonableness Checks After Calculating
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
After calculating, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">verify the answer makes sense</strong>: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Unit check</strong>: Does the answer have the expected units? If calculating speed, is the answer in distance/time units? If you got "5 meters" for speed, that's wrong. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Magnitude check</strong>: Is the size reasonable? If calculating the average height of plants and getting 500 cm (5 meters), that's suspiciously tall for most plants—recheck the calculation. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Comparison to data</strong>: Is the calculated value consistent with the data? If averaging 10, 12, and 14, and you get 25, that's impossible (average must be between 10 and 14). (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Sign check</strong>: If something decreased, the change should be negative. If temperature dropped from 80 to 60 and you calculated +20°C change, you have the sign wrong. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Extreme value check</strong>: If calculating a percentage and getting 350%, ask: is it possible for the value to be more than 100% of something? (Sometimes yes, like 350% increase, but if calculating "percentage of total", it can't exceed 100%). (6) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Quick re-calculation</strong>: If time allows and the answer seems odd, recalculate using a different method or double-check arithmetic. These sanity checks catch errors before you commit to an answer.

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Strategic Calculator Use (If Allowed)
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
If calculators are permitted for science (check current ACT rules): (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Know your calculator</strong>: Be familiar with its functions before test day. Practice operations you'll need: basic arithmetic, exponents, scientific notation, perhaps square roots. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Enter carefully</strong>: Double-check what you're entering. Use parentheses to ensure correct order of operations. Calculate (48 + 52)/(10) as (48+52)÷10, not 48+52÷10 (which would be 48 + 5.2). (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Don't over-rely on it</strong>: Simple calculations (like 50/10 = 5) are faster mentally than typing into a calculator. Save calculator for complex operations (like 147.3/23.5 or 6.7²). (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Scientific notation</strong>: Learn how to enter and interpret scientific notation on your calculator. Entering 3.2 × 10⁷ might require specific button sequences (often "3.2 EE 7" or "3.2 E 7"). (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check the display</strong>: Make sure the calculator shows what you think you entered before hitting equals. (6) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Round appropriately</strong>: Calculators give many decimal places. Round to match answer choice precision. If choices are 3.1, 3.4, 3.7, 4.0 and calculator shows 3.683, the answer is 3.7. Even with a calculator, understanding the concepts and setting up calculations correctly is essential—calculators do arithmetic but don't think for you.

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Estimation and Error Checking</strong><br><br>
<strong>Problem:</strong> Calculate the average of 23.7, 28.3, and 31.2<br>
<strong>Estimation:</strong> Round to 24, 28, 31 → sum ≈ 83 → average ≈ 83/3 ≈ 27.7<br>
<strong>Exact calculation:</strong> (23.7 + 28.3 + 31.2)/3 = 83.2/3 = 27.73<br>
<strong>Check:</strong> Result 27.73 is between 23.7 and 31.2 ✓ (average must be within data range)<br>
<strong>Answer choices:</strong> If choices are 17.7, 27.7, 37.7, 277, select 27.7<br><br>
<strong>Problem with error:</strong> Student calculates percent increase from 40 to 50<br>
Wrong approach: (50-40)/50 × 100% = 20% ✗<br>
Correct: (50-40)/40 × 100% = 25% ✓<br>
<strong>Error check:</strong> 20% increase from 40 would give 40 × 1.20 = 48, not 50. So 20% is wrong.<br>
<strong>Verification:</strong> 25% increase from 40 gives 40 × 1.25 = 50 ✓<br><br>
<strong>Unit check example:</strong> Calculate density with mass = 45 g, volume = 15 cm³<br>
Density = 45 g / 15 cm³ = 3 g/cm³<br>
<strong>Check:</strong> Units are mass/volume (g/cm³) ✓ Typical density values are 0.5-20 g/cm³ for common materials ✓<br>
If accidentally calculated 45 × 15 = 675, units would be g·cm³ (nonsensical for density) ✗
