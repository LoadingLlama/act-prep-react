Figures and text integration questions require you to <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">combine information from visual data</strong> with details from the passage text, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">interpret figures using context</strong> provided in written descriptions, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">apply definitions and explanations</strong> from the passage to understand what figures show, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">synthesize numerical data with conceptual information</strong>. Unlike pure data-reading questions that can be answered entirely from figures, or pure comprehension questions that require only the text, these hybrid questions test your ability to move fluidly between written explanations and visual representations, use passage context to interpret ambiguous figure elements, and connect theoretical concepts described in text with empirical results shown in graphs and tables. This lesson teaches you systematic approaches for identifying when text context is necessary to interpret figures, explains how to efficiently locate relevant passage information for figure-based questions, provides strategies for understanding figure components that require passage definitions, and shows you how to avoid the common pitfall of attempting to answer questions from figures alone when passage context is essential.

1. Understanding When Text Context is Essential
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Text-dependent figure questions</strong> cannot be answered correctly from the figures alone—they require understanding <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">definitions, experimental conditions, or explanations</strong> provided in the passage text.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Recognizing When You Need the Passage Text
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Several <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">signals indicate</strong> that passage text is necessary: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Figure labels use technical terms or abbreviations</strong> that aren't defined in the figure itself. If a graph shows "Species A" and "Species B" but doesn't explain what these species are, you need the passage. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Questions ask about conditions, procedures, or variables mentioned in the question but not visible in the figure</strong>. If a question asks "In which trial was the catalyst used?", the figure might show different trials but the passage text explains which had the catalyst. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Questions require interpretation beyond raw data</strong>, such as "Which figure shows the results when the independent variable was held constant?" You need the passage to know what the independent variable is and whether it was held constant. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Answer choices refer to concepts or categories</strong> (like "acidic solution", "endothermic reaction", "control group") that require understanding what conditions or characteristics define these categories. If you look at a figure and realize you don't understand what a label means, or you can't determine which condition corresponds to what the question is asking, that's your signal to check the passage text.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Types of Information Typically Found in Passage Text
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Passage text typically provides: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Definitions of technical terms</strong>. The passage might define "pH" or explain what "absorbance" means, which helps you understand what the figure's y-axis represents. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Experimental procedures and conditions</strong>. The text explains that "Students measured temperature every 5 minutes while heating the solution" or "Trial 1 used distilled water; Trial 2 used salt water", clarifying what conditions differ between data sets. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Variable relationships and theoretical background</strong>. The passage might explain that "As temperature increases, molecular motion increases, leading to higher reaction rates", helping you interpret why a figure shows an upward trend. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Identification of samples, species, or materials</strong>. The text might state "Solution A contained 0.1 M NaCl; Solution B contained 0.1 M KCl", explaining what the labels "Solution A" and "Solution B" in the figure represent. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Units and measurement methods</strong>. The passage clarifies "Students measured mass in grams using a digital balance" or explains that "light intensity was measured in lumens". This information contextualizes the numerical data in figures and helps you understand what's actually being measured.

The Initial Passage Scan for Figure Context
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
During your <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">initial passage reading</strong> (before diving into questions), perform a quick scan specifically to understand how text and figures relate: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Read the passage introduction</strong> (first 2-3 sentences) to understand the general topic and what's being studied. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Scan for sections that reference figures</strong>. Look for phrases like "as shown in Figure 1", "results are presented in Table 1", or "see Figure 2". These tell you where text and figures connect. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Note any definitions or explanations of variables</strong>. If the passage defines what "trial 1" versus "trial 2" represents, make a mental note. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Identify experimental conditions</strong> described in the text that might explain differences between data sets in figures. This 20-30 second scan creates a mental map of where to look when you need text context for figure interpretation, saving you time when questions require integrated information.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Common Scenarios Requiring Text Integration
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Certain <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">recurring scenarios</strong> almost always require text integration: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Scenario 1: Identifying control groups or variables.</strong> Questions like "Which trial was the control?" require the passage to explain which conditions define the control. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Scenario 2: Distinguishing between similar-looking data sets.</strong> If multiple lines or bars in a figure look similar, the passage explains what differentiates them (different catalysts, different concentrations, etc.). <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Scenario 3: Questions about "why" or causation.</strong> While figures show patterns, the passage often explains why those patterns occur or what theoretical principle they demonstrate. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Scenario 4: Converting between figure labels and question terminology.</strong> The question asks about "acidic conditions" but the figure shows "pH &lt; 7"—the passage provides the knowledge that pH &lt; 7 means acidic. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Scenario 5: Questions asking what would happen under different conditions.</strong> "What would happen if temperature were decreased?" requires understanding from the passage what factors affect the measured variable, not just reading data points. Recognizing these scenarios helps you know immediately that text consultation is necessary.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Identifying Text Dependency</strong><br><br>
<strong>Figure shows:</strong> Three lines labeled "Trial 1", "Trial 2", "Trial 3" showing temperature vs. time<br><br>
<strong>Question:</strong> "In which trial was the insulated container used?"<br><br>
<strong>Analysis:</strong><br>
- Figure shows data for three trials but doesn't indicate which had insulation<br>
- The question asks about experimental conditions not shown in the figure<br>
- Signal: You need the passage text<br><br>
<strong>Passage text says:</strong> "Students heated water in three containers: Trial 1 used a glass beaker, Trial 2 used an insulated thermos, and Trial 3 used a metal pot."<br><br>
<strong>Now you know:</strong> Trial 2 used the insulated container<br><br>
Without reading the passage, you could see the data but couldn't identify which trial had insulation. The figure and text must be integrated to answer correctly.

2. Strategies for Efficiently Locating Relevant Passage Information
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
When you've identified that a question requires text context, you need <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">efficient search strategies</strong> to find the relevant information quickly without re-reading the entire passage.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Using Keywords to Navigate the Passage
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Keyword scanning</strong> is the fastest way to locate specific information: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Extract key terms from the question</strong>. If the question asks about "the catalyst", your keyword is "catalyst". If it asks about "Trial 2", your keyword is "Trial 2". (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Scan the passage for that exact term or close synonyms</strong>. Don't read every word—let your eyes move quickly down the page looking for the keyword to "pop out". (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">When you locate the keyword, read the surrounding 1-2 sentences</strong> carefully. The relevant information is usually within this context. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">If the keyword appears multiple times</strong>, quickly skim each occurrence to determine which provides the needed information. For example, "Trial 2" might be mentioned in the methods (describing setup) and results (describing outcomes)—you likely need the methods section. This targeted scanning is much faster than re-reading the entire passage and helps you find information in 10-15 seconds rather than 45-60 seconds.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Understanding Passage Structure to Predict Information Location
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
ACT Science passages follow <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">predictable structures</strong>, which helps you know where to look: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Introduction (first paragraph)</strong>: Provides general topic, background, and definitions of key terms. Look here for: what's being studied, why it matters, definitions of technical terms. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Methods/Procedure section</strong>: Explains how experiments were conducted, what varied between trials, what was measured. Look here for: experimental conditions, differences between trials, control vs. experimental groups, measurement procedures. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Results section (often integrated with figures)</strong>: Describes what was observed. Look here for: interpretations of trends, explanations of patterns. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Figure captions or notes</strong>: Provide specific details about what figures show. Look here for: units, definitions of symbols or labels, special conditions. When you need to find specific information, think about what type of information it is, then go directly to the relevant section rather than searching randomly.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
The Cross-Reference Method for Figure Labels
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
When a figure uses <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">labels, abbreviations, or symbols</strong> that aren't self-explanatory, use this systematic approach: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Identify the unclear label</strong>. For example, a figure might show "Solution X" and "Solution Y" but not explain what these are. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check the figure caption first</strong>. Many figures include notes like "X = distilled water, Y = salt water" right below the figure. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">If not in the caption, scan the passage for the label term</strong>. Search for "Solution X" or just "X" in the passage. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Read the sentence containing the label</strong> to understand what it represents. The passage might say "Students prepared Solution X by dissolving 10 g of sugar in water" and "Solution Y contained no sugar", clarifying what each represents. (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Make a quick note if needed</strong> (like writing "X=sugar, Y=no sugar" near the figure) so you don't have to look it up again for subsequent questions. This cross-reference method is essential for correctly interpreting figures that use abstract labels.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Recognizing When Information Isn't Explicitly Stated
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Sometimes, the connection between text and figures requires <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">inference rather than explicit statement</strong>: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">The passage describes a general principle</strong>, and you need to apply it to interpret figure patterns. For example, "Increasing temperature increases molecular motion" helps you understand why a graph shows higher reaction rates at higher temperatures, even though the passage doesn't explicitly say "Figure 1 shows that higher temperatures cause higher reaction rates". (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">The passage describes different conditions</strong>, and you need to match them to unlabeled figure elements. If the passage says "Trial 1 had the highest initial concentration" and Figure 1 shows three lines with one starting highest, you can infer that the highest line represents Trial 1. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Definitions must be applied to classify data</strong>. The passage might define "basic solutions have pH &gt; 7" and then ask which trial used a basic solution—you check the figure to see which trial had pH &gt; 7. To handle these situations: Read the passage for general principles and definitions, then actively apply them to interpret figure data rather than expecting every connection to be explicitly spelled out.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Efficient Information Location</strong><br><br>
<strong>Question:</strong> "Which trial used the control group?"<br><br>
<strong>Step 1 (Keyword identification):</strong> Keywords are "trial" and "control group"<br><br>
<strong>Step 2 (Predict location):</strong> Experimental conditions → likely in methods/procedure section<br><br>
<strong>Step 3 (Keyword scan):</strong> Scan passage for "control"<br>
Found in paragraph 2: "Students set up four trials. Trial 1 served as the control with no fertilizer added. Trials 2, 3, and 4 received different amounts of fertilizer."<br><br>
<strong>Step 4 (Extract answer):</strong> Trial 1 = control<br><br>
<strong>Time elapsed:</strong> 10-15 seconds<br><br>
Without this systematic approach, you might waste 45+ seconds re-reading the entire passage trying to find which trial was the control.
</p>


<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Integrating Text Explanations with Figure Data
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Integration</strong> means combining what you learn from the passage text with what you observe in figures to form complete, accurate answers.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Using Text to Interpret Figure Trends
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
When questions ask you to <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">explain or interpret trends</strong>, you often need both figure data (to see what happened) and passage text (to explain why): (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Identify the trend in the figure</strong>. For example, "As pH increases, enzyme activity increases up to pH 7, then decreases". (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Look for passage explanations of what affects the measured variable</strong>. The passage might explain: "Enzymes work best at optimal pH. Too acidic or too basic conditions denature the enzyme". (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Connect the explanation to the trend</strong>. The peak at pH 7 represents the optimal pH; below and above that, denaturation reduces activity. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Use this integrated understanding to answer interpretation questions</strong> like "Why did enzyme activity decrease above pH 7?" Answer: "The basic conditions caused denaturation". The figure tells you that it decreased; the passage tells you why. Together, they form a complete answer.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Using Text to Distinguish Between Figure Elements
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
When figures contain <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">multiple data sets</strong> (multiple lines, multiple bars, multiple trials), passage text often explains what distinguishes them: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Note what varies between the data sets</strong>. The figure might show three different lines but not explain what's different about them. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Find the passage description of experimental setup</strong>. The text might explain: "Trial 1 used a copper catalyst, Trial 2 used an iron catalyst, Trial 3 used no catalyst". (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Match passage descriptions to figure elements</strong>. If the passage says "reactions with catalysts were faster" and you see two lines above one line in the figure, you can infer that the top two lines are Trials 1 and 2 (with catalysts) and the bottom line is Trial 3 (no catalyst). (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Use this matching to answer questions</strong> about specific conditions. "Which trial showed the fastest rate?" = whichever line is highest = Trials 1 or 2 (one with a catalyst). This integration allows you to identify what different figure elements represent even when labels are minimal.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Applying Text Definitions to Categorize Figure Data
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Many questions require you to <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">apply definitions from the text</strong> to classify or categorize data in figures: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Identify the category or classification mentioned in the question</strong>. For example, "Which trials used endothermic reactions?" (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Find the passage definition of that category</strong>. The text might say: "Endothermic reactions absorb heat, causing temperature to decrease". (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check the figure to see which data meets the definition</strong>. Look at the temperature data in the figure—which trials show temperature decreasing? (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Those trials match the category</strong>. If Trials 2 and 4 show temperature decreasing, those were endothermic. This process requires actively applying text-based definitions to classify figure data. You can't answer these questions from the figure alone (which just shows temperature changes) or from the text alone (which defines endothermic but doesn't say which specific trials were endothermic)—you must integrate both sources.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Using Text to Make Predictions Beyond Figure Data
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Some questions ask you to <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">predict what would happen under conditions not shown in the figure</strong>: "If students increased the concentration further, what would likely happen to the reaction rate?" To answer these: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Observe the trend in the figure</strong>. The figure might show that as concentration increases from 0.1 to 0.5 M, reaction rate increases from 10 to 50 units/sec. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check the passage for theoretical explanations</strong>. The text might explain: "Higher concentration means more reactant molecules available for collisions, increasing reaction rate". (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Apply the principle to make the prediction</strong>. Since higher concentration consistently increases rate, further increases in concentration would likely continue to increase rate. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Select the answer that matches your reasoning</strong>. The figure shows the pattern; the text explains the underlying mechanism; together they enable prediction beyond the measured data.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Integrating Text and Figure</strong><br><br>
<strong>Passage text says:</strong> "Solutions with pH &lt; 7 are acidic. Solutions with pH = 7 are neutral. Solutions with pH &gt; 7 are basic."<br><br>
<strong>Figure shows:</strong> Table with four solutions and their measured pH values:
- Solution A: pH = 4
- Solution B: pH = 7
- Solution C: pH = 9
- Solution D: pH = 11<br><br>
<strong>Question:</strong> "Which solutions were basic?"<br><br>
<strong>Integration process:</strong><br>
Step 1: Find definition of "basic" in passage → pH &gt; 7<br>
Step 2: Check figure for pH values &gt; 7 → Solutions C (pH 9) and D (pH 11)<br>
Step 3: Integrate → Solutions C and D were basic<br><br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> C and D<br><br>
Neither the text alone (which defines basic but doesn't identify specific solutions) nor the figure alone (which shows pH values but doesn't define what "basic" means) is sufficient. You must integrate both.

4. Common Pitfalls and Advanced Strategies
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Avoiding common mistakes</strong> and employing advanced strategies helps you maximize accuracy on text-figure integration questions.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Pitfall #1: Attempting to Answer from Figures Alone
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
The most common error is <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">trying to answer text-dependent questions using only figure data</strong>. Students see a question that mentions a figure and immediately look at the figure without reading the passage, leading to wrong answers when context is essential. To avoid this: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Always read the question completely</strong> before deciding you only need the figure. Look for terminology that requires definition or context. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">If a question asks about concepts, categories, or conditions</strong> (like "control group", "acidic solution", "endothermic reaction"), assume you need the passage. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">If you look at the figure and can't tell which element corresponds to what the question asks</strong>, that's a signal you need text context. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">When in doubt, do a quick 10-second passage scan</strong> for relevant keywords. This small time investment prevents wrong answers. Many students prioritize speed over accuracy and skip the passage consultation, resulting in preventable errors.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Pitfall #2: Mismatching Passage Descriptions to Figure Elements
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
When passages describe multiple conditions and figures show multiple data sets, students sometimes <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">incorrectly match</strong> which description goes with which figure element. For example, if the passage describes Trial 1, 2, and 3 in one order but the figure shows them in a different order or with different symbols, confusion results. To prevent this: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Look for explicit connections</strong>. Check if the passage or figure caption explicitly states "Trial 1 is shown as circles, Trial 2 as squares". (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Use distinguishing characteristics to match</strong>. If the passage says "Trial 1 had the highest initial temperature" and one line in the figure starts highest, that's Trial 1. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Don't assume order matches</strong>. Just because the passage discusses A, B, C in that order doesn't mean the figure shows them left-to-right or top-to-bottom in the same order. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Verify your matching makes sense</strong>. If the passage says "adding a catalyst increased the rate" and you've matched the slowest line to the catalyst condition, you've likely mismatched.

Pitfall #3: Over-Relying on Prior Knowledge Instead of Passage Definitions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Some students use <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">outside knowledge</strong> to interpret figures rather than using passage definitions, which can lead to errors if the passage uses terms in specific ways. For example, you might know from chemistry class that "catalyst" generally speeds up reactions, but a specific passage might define a catalyst differently for that context, or might be testing a different aspect. To avoid this: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Always use passage definitions when provided</strong>. If the passage defines a term, use that definition rather than your prior knowledge. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">The ACT Science section tests reading comprehension and data interpretation</strong>, not recall of outside science facts. The passage provides all needed information. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">If your prior knowledge conflicts with passage information</strong>, trust the passage. The passage is the authoritative source for that question. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Prior knowledge is helpful for general understanding</strong> but shouldn't override specific passage details. While some general science knowledge is useful, relying on it instead of reading carefully causes errors when passages use terms in specific ways.

Advanced Strategy: Annotating Figures with Text Context
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
An <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">efficient advanced technique</strong> is to annotate figures with brief notes from the passage: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">When you find important text context for a figure</strong>, write a brief note directly on or next to the figure. For example, if the passage says "Trial 1 used the catalyst", write "catalyst" next to the Trial 1 line in the figure. (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Label unclear abbreviations or symbols</strong>. If the figure shows "A" and "B" and the passage explains these are "acidic" and "basic" solutions, write those terms near the labels. (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Note key conditions or characteristics</strong>. If the passage indicates which trial was the control, which had the highest concentration, etc., mark this on the figure. (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">These annotations serve as a reference for all questions</strong>, so you don't have to re-consult the passage repeatedly for the same information. This technique is especially valuable for complex passages with multiple trials or conditions. The few seconds spent annotating save significant time across multiple questions and reduce errors from forgetting or confusing text context.

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Avoiding Pitfalls</strong><br><br>
<strong>Pitfall 1 - Figure-Only Attempt:</strong><br>
Question: "Which trial used the control group?"<br>
Figure shows: Three lines labeled Trial 1, 2, 3<br>
Wrong approach: Guess based on the figure alone → 33% chance<br>
Correct approach: Scan passage → "Trial 1 was the control" → 100% confidence<br><br>
<strong>Pitfall 2 - Mismatching:</strong><br>
Passage: "Solution A was most concentrated. Solution B was least concentrated."<br>
Figure: Two lines, top line and bottom line (unlabeled which is which)<br>
Wrong assumption: Top line must be A because it's mentioned first<br>
Correct reasoning: "Most concentrated" should show highest values → Check which line shows higher values → That's Solution A (might be bottom line if axes show it differently)<br><br>
<strong>Pitfall 3 - Prior Knowledge Override:</strong><br>
Question: "Which solution was acidic?"<br>
You know: Lemon juice is acidic<br>
Passage: "Acidic solutions have pH &lt; 7. Solution X had pH 5, Solution Y had pH 9."<br>
Wrong: Choose Solution Y because you remember it's what you tested in class once<br>
Correct: Use passage definition → pH &lt; 7 = acidic → Solution X (pH 5) is acidic<br><br>
<strong>Advanced Strategy - Annotation:</strong><br>
After reading passage, annotate figure:<br>
Trial 1 → Write "control" next to it<br>
Trial 2 → Write "high temp"<br>
Trial 3 → Write "low temp"<br>
Now all subsequent questions can be answered quickly using annotations without re-reading passage.
