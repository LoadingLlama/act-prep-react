<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. The Four Main Question Categories
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
ACT Science questions fall into four main categories based on what skill they're testing: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Data Representation questions</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Scientific Investigation questions</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Evaluation of Models and Inferences questions</strong>, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Hypothesis-Testing questions</strong>. Recognizing which category a question belongs to helps you know where to look for the answer and what type of reasoning to apply.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Data Representation Questions (40-50% of questions)
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Data Representation questions</strong> ask you to extract specific values, identify trends, or interpret information directly from graphs, tables, or diagrams. These questions typically contain phrases like: "According to Figure 1...", "Based on Table 2...", "As shown in the graph...", or "What was the value of X when Y was...?" The answers to these questions are found directly in the figures—you don't need to make complex inferences or apply outside knowledge. Common Data Representation question types include: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">specific value questions</strong> that ask for an exact data point, (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">trend identification questions</strong> that ask whether variables increase, decrease, or remain constant, (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">comparison questions</strong> that ask you to compare values across conditions, and (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">interpolation/extrapolation questions</strong> that ask you to estimate values between or beyond measured data points. To answer these efficiently, immediately look at the referenced figure and methodically find the requested information.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Scientific Investigation Questions (20-30% of questions)
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Scientific Investigation questions</strong> test your understanding of experimental design, variables, controls, and scientific methodology. These questions ask about: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">which variables were manipulated</strong> (independent variables), (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">which variables were measured</strong> (dependent variables), (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">which variables were controlled</strong> (held constant), (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">why specific procedures were used</strong>, or (5) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">how to extend or modify the experiment</strong>. Signal phrases include: "Which variable was directly manipulated?", "What was held constant?", "The purpose of Trial 1 was to...", "To investigate [new question], students should...", or "What hypothesis was being tested?" To answer these questions, focus on the experimental descriptions and understand the logic behind how the experiment was designed. You need to think about why scientists set up trials in specific ways and what each trial was meant to test.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Evaluation of Models and Inferences Questions (25-35% of questions)
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Evaluation questions</strong> require higher-order thinking and ask you to: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">draw conclusions</strong> from data, (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">make inferences</strong> about what results suggest, (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">evaluate whether hypotheses are supported</strong> by evidence, or (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">predict outcomes</strong> based on trends. Signal phrases include: "Based on the results, which conclusion is best supported?", "The data are most consistent with which hypothesis?", "Which statement is supported by...?", "If the experiment had continued...", or "The results suggest that...". These questions require you to synthesize information, often from multiple figures or trials, and apply logical reasoning. Unlike Data Representation questions where answers are explicitly stated in figures, Evaluation questions ask you to think about what the data means and what logical conclusions can be drawn. Be careful to choose answers that are directly supported by the passage rather than answers that seem plausible but lack textual evidence.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Hypothesis-Testing and Viewpoint Comparison Questions (Primarily in Conflicting Viewpoints passages)
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Hypothesis-Testing and Viewpoint questions</strong> appear primarily in Conflicting Viewpoints passages and ask you to: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">understand different scientific perspectives</strong>, (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">compare and contrast viewpoints</strong>, (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">identify points of agreement or disagreement</strong>, or (4) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">evaluate which viewpoint is supported by new evidence</strong>. Signal phrases include: "Scientist 1 would most likely agree that...", "According to Student 2's view...", "Both scientists would agree that...", "Which finding would support Hypothesis A?", or "The two students disagree about...". To answer these questions effectively, you need to carefully read each viewpoint's main claims and supporting evidence, noting similarities and differences between perspectives. Create a mental or written comparison of the key points of each view. These questions test reading comprehension and logical analysis rather than data interpretation, making them more similar to Reading section questions than typical Science questions.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Identifying Question Categories</strong><br><br>
<strong>Data Representation:</strong> "According to Figure 2, what was the temperature when pressure was 50 kPa?" → Look at Figure 2 and read the value directly<br><br>
<strong>Scientific Investigation:</strong> "Which variable was held constant across all three trials?" → Review experimental descriptions to identify what didn't change<br><br>
<strong>Evaluation:</strong> "Based on the results of Experiments 1 and 2, which conclusion is most strongly supported?" → Synthesize data from multiple sources and apply logic<br><br>
<strong>Viewpoint Comparison:</strong> "Student 1 and Student 2 would most likely agree about which of the following?" → Compare the two viewpoints to find common ground

2. Key Signal Words and Phrases
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Learning to recognize <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">signal words and phrases</strong> in question stems helps you quickly diagnose what type of question you're facing and what approach to use. These linguistic clues tell you whether you need to find specific data, understand experimental design, draw conclusions, or compare viewpoints.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Signals for Direct Data-Reading Questions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
When you see phrases like <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"According to..."</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"Based on..."</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"As shown in..."</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"What was the value..."</strong>, or <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"In Figure/Table X..."</strong>, the question is asking you to extract information directly from a specific source. Your task is straightforward: locate the referenced figure or table and find the requested value, trend, or comparison. These are typically the fastest questions to answer because they don't require complex reasoning—just careful data reading. Common variations include: "According to Figure 3, as temperature increased, pressure:", "Based on the data in Table 1, which trial had the highest concentration?", "What was the pH when volume was 30 mL?", or "As shown in the graph, at what time did the reaction rate peak?" When you see these signal words, immediately shift your attention to the specified figure and methodically locate the answer.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Signals for Experimental Design Questions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Phrases like <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"Which variable was..."</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"What was held constant..."</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"The purpose of..."</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"To test the hypothesis..."</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"What was directly manipulated..."</strong>, or <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"How could the experiment be extended..."</strong> signal questions about experimental methodology and design. When you encounter these, focus on understanding the structure and logic of the experiment rather than specific data values. You need to think about: What changed between trials? What was measured as an outcome? What factors were kept the same to ensure a fair comparison? Why was the experiment set up this way? Example questions include: "Which variable was directly manipulated by the researchers?", "What was held constant in all three trials?", "The purpose of using a control group was to...", or "To determine whether light affects growth, students should...". Answer these by analyzing experimental descriptions and applying your understanding of scientific methodology.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Signals for Inference and Conclusion Questions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Words like <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"Based on the results..."</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"Which conclusion is supported..."</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"The data suggest..."</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"It can be inferred..."</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"The results are most consistent with..."</strong>, or <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"If the experiment had continued..."</strong> indicate that you need to draw conclusions or make logical inferences rather than simply reading data. These questions require synthesis and reasoning. When you see these signals, recognize that you'll need to: (1) consider multiple pieces of evidence, (2) apply logical thinking to determine what the data means, (3) <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Cross out wrong answer choices">eliminate</span> answer choices that aren't supported by the passage, and (4) select the conclusion that is most strongly backed by evidence. Example questions: "Based on the results of all three trials, which conclusion is best supported?", "The data in Figures 1 and 2 suggest that...", "Which hypothesis is most consistent with the experimental results?", or "If temperature had continued to increase beyond 80°C, reaction rate would most likely have...". Take your time with these questions and verify that your answer is truly supported by the passage.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Signals for Viewpoint and Agreement Questions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
In Conflicting Viewpoints passages, watch for phrases like <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"Scientist 1 believes..."</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"According to Student 2..."</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"Both scientists agree..."</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"The two viewpoints differ on..."</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"Which finding would support..."</strong>, or <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"Hypothesis A differs from Hypothesis B in..."</strong>. These signal that you need to understand and compare different scientific perspectives. When you see these phrases, you should: (1) identify which specific viewpoint the question is asking about, (2) locate that viewpoint's position on the topic in question, (3) compare it to other viewpoints if necessary, and (4) verify your answer against the text. Example questions: "Student 1 would most likely agree with which statement?", "According to Scientist 2, the primary cause of the phenomenon is...", "Both scientists would agree that...", "Which observation would support Hypothesis A but not Hypothesis B?", or "The main point of disagreement between the two students is...". These questions require careful reading comprehension and comparison skills.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Signal Word Recognition</strong><br><br>
<strong>Question 1:</strong> "According to Table 2, what was the volume when pressure was 2.0 atm?"<br>
<strong>Signal:</strong> "According to" → Direct data reading → Look at Table 2 and find the value<br><br>
<strong>Question 2:</strong> "Which variable was held constant in all three experiments?"<br>
<strong>Signal:</strong> "held constant" → Experimental design → Review what didn't change between trials<br><br>
<strong>Question 3:</strong> "Based on the results, which hypothesis is most strongly supported?"<br>
<strong>Signal:</strong> "Based on the results... supported" → Inference/conclusion → Synthesize data and evaluate<br><br>
<strong>Question 4:</strong> "Student 1 and Student 2 would most likely agree about which of the following?"<br>
<strong>Signal:</strong> "Student 1 and Student 2... agree" → Viewpoint comparison → Find common ground

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Determining Where to Find Answers
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Efficient question-answering requires knowing <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">where to look</strong> for the information you need. Different question types require you to reference different parts of the passage: specific figures, experimental descriptions, result summaries, or viewpoint text. Learning to quickly identify the correct source saves significant time and prevents frustration.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Using Explicit References (Figure Numbers, Table Numbers)
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Many Science questions provide <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">explicit references</strong> that tell you exactly where to look: "According to Figure 3...", "Based on Table 1...", "As shown in the diagram...", or "In Experiment 2...". When you see these explicit references, immediately go to that specific figure, table, or section. Don't waste time re-reading other parts of the passage or trying to answer from memory. The explicit reference is a gift—it's telling you precisely where the answer is located. If the question says "According to Figure 2," the answer will be found by analyzing Figure 2, not by reading text or examining other figures. If it says "In Experiment 3," focus on the description and results of Experiment 3 specifically. This direct approach is faster and more accurate than trying to work from memory or searching randomly through the passage. Even if you think you remember the information, always verify by checking the referenced source to avoid careless errors.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Using Implicit Clues (Variable Names, Trial Numbers)
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
When questions don't explicitly reference a figure number, you can often determine where to look based on <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">variable names</strong> or <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">trial numbers</strong> mentioned in the question. For example, if a question asks "How did pH affect reaction rate?", you know to look for a figure or table that shows pH and reaction rate together. If it asks "What temperature was used in Trial 2?", you should examine the description or data for Trial 2 specifically. Similarly, if a question mentions specific units like "kPa" or "mol/L," scan the passage for figures using those units. This detective work—using contextual clues to determine where relevant information is located—becomes faster with practice. When multiple figures show similar variables, the question number can provide additional guidance: questions 1-2 usually relate to early figures or experiments, while questions 5-6 often address later content. This logical progression helps you narrow down where to search.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Recognizing Questions Requiring Multiple Sources
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Some questions, particularly <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">evaluation and synthesis questions</strong>, require you to combine information from <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">multiple sources</strong>. Signal phrases include: "Based on the results of Experiments 1 and 2...", "According to Figures 1, 2, and 3...", "Comparing the data in all three trials...", or "Using information from both the table and the graph...". When you encounter these questions, recognize that you'll need to: (1) examine each referenced source, (2) extract relevant information from each, (3) synthesize or compare the information, and (4) draw a conclusion based on the combined evidence. These questions take longer than single-source questions, so budget extra time. Create brief mental or written notes comparing the key findings from each source. For example, "Figure 1 shows pH increases with time; Figure 2 shows temperature increases with time; both increase together, suggesting they're related." This systematic comparison helps you identify patterns and draw supported conclusions.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Knowing When to Reference Text vs. Figures
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Understanding when to focus on <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">text</strong> versus <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">figures</strong> prevents wasted time. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Figures and tables</strong> answer questions about: specific data values, trends, comparisons between conditions, and visual relationships. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Text</strong> answers questions about: experimental procedures, what variables represent, what equipment was used, what hypotheses were being tested, and why certain methods were chosen. For example, if a question asks "What was the concentration in Trial 3?", that's a data value question—check the table or figure. But if it asks "Why did researchers heat the solution before measuring pH?", that's a procedural explanation question—check the text describing methods. Similarly, viewpoint questions in Conflicting Viewpoints passages almost always require reading the text where each scientist's argument is presented. Developing this instinct for where to look—figures for data, text for explanations—dramatically improves efficiency.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Locating Answer Sources</strong><br><br>
<strong>Question:</strong> "According to Figure 2, as altitude increased from 0 to 3,000 m, atmospheric pressure:"<br>
<strong>Where to look:</strong> Figure 2 (explicit reference) → Find altitude and pressure variables<br><br>
<strong>Question:</strong> "What was the purpose of using a water bath to maintain constant temperature?"<br>
<strong>Where to look:</strong> Text describing experimental procedures (looking for explanations, not data)<br><br>
<strong>Question:</strong> "Based on Figures 1 and 3, which factor had a greater effect on reaction rate?"<br>
<strong>Where to look:</strong> Both Figure 1 and Figure 3 (multiple sources) → Compare the magnitude of effects<br><br>
<strong>Question:</strong> "Student 2 argues that climate change is primarily caused by:"<br>
<strong>Where to look:</strong> Text of Student 2's viewpoint (reading comprehension of argument)
</p>


<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Common Question Misinterpretation Pitfalls
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Even when you have strong data interpretation skills, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">misinterpreting what a question is asking</strong> can lead to incorrect answers. Understanding common misinterpretation pitfalls helps you read questions more carefully and avoid preventable errors that waste your skills and knowledge.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Confusing "Increase" with "Decrease" or "Direct" with "Inverse"
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
One of the most common errors is <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">mixing up directional language</strong>. Questions might ask "As X increased, Y:" and the correct answer is "increased" but students who misread the question select "decreased." Or a question asks about a "direct relationship" (both increase together) but students confuse it with an "inverse relationship" (one increases while the other decreases). To avoid this pitfall: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">read the question twice</strong> before looking at answer choices, (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">underline or circle</strong> key directional words like "increase," "decrease," "direct," "inverse," "positive," or "negative," (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">verify your answer</strong> by checking the figure one more time before moving on. This type of error is particularly frustrating because you may have correctly read the data but simply mixed up the wording. Slowing down for just 3-4 extra seconds to ensure you understand what direction the question is asking about can prevent these costly mistakes.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Missing Qualifiers Like "NOT," "EXCEPT," or "LEAST"
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Questions containing <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">negative qualifiers</strong> or <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">reversal words</strong> are specifically designed to test whether you're reading carefully. Examples include: "Which of the following is NOT supported by the data?", "All of the following were held constant EXCEPT:", "Which conclusion is LEAST consistent with the results?", or "Which factor did NOT affect reaction rate?" These questions reverse the normal logic—instead of finding what IS true, you're finding what ISN'T true. Students who skim too quickly often miss these critical words and select the opposite of the correct answer. To avoid this trap: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">circle or highlight</strong> any negative qualifiers when you read the question, (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">remind yourself</strong> that you're looking for the exception or the false statement, not the true statement, (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;"><span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Cross out wrong answer choices">eliminate</span> answers</strong> systematically by identifying which three ARE true (and therefore wrong) to find the one that is NOT true (the correct answer). These questions tend to be slightly harder, so allocate a few extra seconds to process them carefully.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Answering a Different Question Than What Was Asked
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Sometimes students find an answer that is true according to the passage but doesn't actually answer the specific question asked. For example, a question might ask "What was the dependent variable in Experiment 2?" and a student selects an answer about the independent variable because they saw it mentioned in the experimental description. Or a question asks "According to Scientist 1..." but the student selects a statement from Scientist 2's viewpoint. This happens when you're working too quickly or when you find information that seems relevant but don't verify that it actually addresses the question. To prevent this: (1) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">reread the question stem</strong> after you've found your answer but before selecting it, (2) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ask yourself</strong> "Does this answer specifically address what was asked?", (3) <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">double-check</strong> that you're referencing the correct figure, trial, or scientist mentioned in the question. Just because an answer choice is factually true doesn't mean it's correct—it must also answer the actual question.

Overthinking Simple Questions or Underthinking Complex Ones
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Students sometimes make questions harder than they are by <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">overthinking</strong> straightforward data-reading questions, or conversely, they treat complex synthesis questions too simplistically by <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">underthinking</strong> them. For simple questions like "According to Table 1, what was the pH at 60 seconds?", the answer is just the value in the table—don't second-guess yourself or look for hidden complexity. The ACT doesn't try to trick you with intentionally confusing data on these straightforward questions. However, for complex questions like "Based on all three experiments, which variable had the greatest effect on the outcome?", you DO need to think carefully, compare magnitudes of effects across experiments, and reason through the logic. The key is <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">calibrating your effort level</strong> to the question type. Use signal words to help you gauge difficulty: "According to..." signals a simple question; "Based on... which conclusion is best supported..." signals a complex one that deserves more thought and time.

<strong>Example: Avoiding Misinterpretation Pitfalls</strong><br><br>
<strong>Pitfall 1:</strong> Question asks "As pressure increased, volume:" → Circle "increased" to avoid mixing up the direction → Answer: decreased (inverse relationship)<br><br>
<strong>Pitfall 2:</strong> Question asks "All of the following were controlled variables EXCEPT:" → Circle "EXCEPT" to remember you're looking for what WASN'T controlled → Answer: the independent variable that was manipulated<br><br>
<strong>Pitfall 3:</strong> Question asks "What was the dependent variable?" → Before selecting, reread question to confirm you're answering about dependent, not independent variable<br><br>
<strong>Pitfall 4:</strong> Simple question: "According to Figure 1, what was Y when X = 10?" → Don't overthink; just read the value from the graph<br>
Complex question: "Based on Figures 1-3, which factor most strongly affected the outcome?" → Take time to compare all three sources
