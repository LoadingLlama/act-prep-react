<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Mean</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">median</strong>, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">mode</strong> are tested in 2-4 questions on every ACT Math test, making them essential statistics concepts to master. The ACT tests your ability to calculate the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">mean (average)</strong>, find the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">median (middle value)</strong>, identify the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">mode (most frequent value)</strong>, and understand when each measure is most appropriate. Common traps include confusing which formula to use, forgetting to sort data before finding the median, or not recognizing the impact of outliers on these measuresâ€”mastering these fundamentals ensures you can quickly analyze any data set.
