Exponential functions model rapid growth and decay in real-world situations like population growth, compound interest, and radioactive decay. Understanding the structure of these functions and how to solve exponential equations is essential for ACT success.

An <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">exponential growth function</strong> has the form f(t) = aÂ·b^t where a is the initial value, b is the growth factor (b &gt; 1), and t is time. As t increases, the function values grow rapidly, creating a characteristic J-shaped curve.
