<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
The ACT Reading section includes one <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">paired passage set</strong> consisting of two shorter passages (Passage A and Passage B) that address related topics from different perspectives, requiring you to understand each passage individually while also analyzing their relationships, identifying points of agreement and disagreement, and synthesizing information across both texts. These dual passage questions test sophisticated comprehension skills including <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">comparative analysis</strong>, recognition of contrasting viewpoints, identification of complementary information, and the ability to distinguish which passage supports which claim. Many students struggle with paired passages because they attempt to read and process both simultaneously, become confused about which information comes from which passage, or fail to recognize the specific types of relationships the questions ask about. This lesson provides systematic strategies for <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">reading paired passages efficiently</strong>, organizing information to prevent confusion between passages, approaching comparison questions methodically, and managing the unique time pressures created by having two texts to analyze within the same time constraints as single-passage sections. You'll learn to identify common <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">relationship patterns</strong> between paired passages and develop techniques for handling questions that require synthesis of information from both texts.

1. Understanding Paired Passage Structure and Question Types
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Paired passages follow a predictable structure and generate specific question types that differ from single-passage questions. Understanding this structure helps you prepare for what to expect and how to approach them efficiently.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
The Paired Passage Format
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
The ACT Reading section consistently includes <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">one paired passage set</strong>, typically in the social science or humanities section, though occasionally in natural science. This set consists of <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Passage A</strong> (approximately 400-450 words) followed by <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Passage B</strong> (approximately 400-450 words), for a combined total of roughly 800-900 words—slightly shorter than a single full-length passage (which typically runs 900-1000 words). The passages address related topics but present different perspectives, focus on different aspects, or argue different positions. Common relationships include: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Contrasting perspectives</strong>—both passages discuss the same topic but reach different conclusions or support different positions. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Complementary focuses</strong>—both passages discuss related aspects of a topic (one historical, one contemporary; one scientific, one social; one theoretical, one practical). <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Different scopes</strong>—one presents a broad overview while the other focuses on a specific case study or example. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Debate or dialogue</strong>—passages present opposing sides of an argument or controversy. The passages are clearly labeled "Passage A" and "Passage B," with 10 questions following (compared to 10 questions for standard single passages).
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Three Categories of Questions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Paired passage questions fall into three distinct categories, each requiring different approaches: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Passage A only questions</strong> (typically 2-3 questions)—these ask exclusively about Passage A and can be answered without reading Passage B. Question stems explicitly indicate focus on Passage A: "According to Passage A..." or "The author of Passage A suggests..." <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Passage B only questions</strong> (typically 2-3 questions)—these ask exclusively about Passage B and can be answered without referring to Passage A. Question stems clearly specify Passage B: "In Passage B, the author argues..." or "According to Passage B..." <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Comparison/synthesis questions</strong> (typically 4-5 questions)—these require understanding both passages and analyzing their relationship. Question stems include phrases like "Both passages discuss..." "Unlike Passage A, Passage B..." "Compared to the author of Passage A, the author of Passage B..." or "Both authors would most likely agree that..." Recognizing question categories is crucial because it tells you whether you need to consult one passage or both, preventing wasted time and confusion.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Common Comparison Question Patterns
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Comparison questions follow predictable patterns that test specific analytical skills: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Agreement questions</strong>—"Both authors would most likely agree that..." (identify claims supported by both passages). <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Disagreement questions</strong>—"The authors disagree about..." or "Unlike the author of Passage A, the author of Passage B believes..." (identify contrasting positions). <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Perspective questions</strong>—"How would the author of Passage B most likely respond to the claim in lines 15-17 of Passage A?" (predict how one author would react to the other's arguments). <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Relationship questions</strong>—"Passage B relates to Passage A by..." (describe how passages connect—supporting, contradicting, elaborating, providing examples, etc.). <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Shared topic questions</strong>—"Both passages discuss..." (identify common themes or topics addressed in both, even if from different angles). <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Unique focus questions</strong>—"Which of the following is discussed in Passage A but not in Passage B?" (identify content unique to one passage). Understanding these patterns helps you know what to look for when analyzing passage relationships.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Why Students Find Paired Passages Challenging
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Several factors make paired passages more challenging than single passages: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Information confusion</strong>—students mix up which passage said what, attributing Passage A's claims to Passage B or vice versa. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Mental fatigue</strong>—reading and comprehending two passages requires sustained attention, and fatigue can cause careless errors. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Comparison complexity</strong>—analyzing relationships between passages is cognitively more demanding than understanding a single passage. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Time pressure perception</strong>—having two passages to read within approximately 9 minutes (same time as a single passage) can create anxiety, causing rushed reading. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Reading inefficiency</strong>—students sometimes read both passages completely before looking at questions, then have to reread extensively to answer comparison questions, wasting time. The strategies in this lesson address each of these challenges systematically, helping you approach paired passages with confidence and efficiency.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Recognizing Question Categories</strong><br><br>
<strong>Passage A only:</strong> "The author of Passage A mentions historical evidence primarily to..." (only need to understand Passage A's use of evidence)<br><br>
<strong>Passage B only:</strong> "According to Passage B, what is the main advantage of the proposed approach?" (only need to understand Passage B's content)<br><br>
<strong>Agreement comparison:</strong> "Both authors would most likely agree with which statement?" (need to identify claims both passages support)<br><br>
<strong>Disagreement comparison:</strong> "Unlike the author of Passage A, the author of Passage B emphasizes..." (need to identify how passages differ in emphasis)<br><br>
<strong>Relationship comparison:</strong> "Passage B primarily serves to..." (need to understand how B relates to A—supports, contradicts, extends, etc.)<br><br>
<strong>Strategy:</strong> Identify the question category immediately from the stem to know whether you need to consult one passage or both.

2. The Strategic Reading Approach for Paired Passages
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Unlike single passages where you can read straight through, paired passages benefit from a more strategic approach that helps you organize information, prevent confusion, and answer questions efficiently.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
The Sequential Method: Read A, Answer A Questions, Read B, Answer All
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
The most effective strategy for most students is the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">sequential method</strong>: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Step 1: Read Passage A completely</strong>, applying your normal active reading strategies (identify main idea, note key details, understand author's purpose). <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Step 2: Answer all questions about Passage A only</strong>—these will be clearly marked as asking specifically about Passage A. Skip comparison questions for now. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Step 3: Read Passage B completely</strong>, again using active reading strategies but also mentally noting how B relates to A (Does it agree? Disagree? Focus on different aspects? Provide examples?). <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Step 4: Answer all questions about Passage B only</strong>, then tackle comparison questions. This method provides several advantages: You're not holding both passages in memory simultaneously (reducing cognitive load), you can answer single-passage questions immediately while passage details are fresh, and you read Passage B with Passage A in mind, making comparison easier. By the time you reach comparison questions, you've already engaged deeply with both passages through answering single-passage questions, making synthesis more natural.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Active Notation to Prevent Confusion
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
One of the biggest challenges with paired passages is <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">remembering which passage said what</strong>. Combat this through systematic notation: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Label key ideas with A or B</strong>—when taking notes or underlining, mark significant points with "A" or "B" to track source. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Note the main idea of each passage separately</strong>—at the end of each passage, jot a quick phrase capturing its central point. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Mark points of clear agreement or disagreement</strong>—if you notice while reading that passages take opposite positions on something, note it. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Highlight unique topics</strong>—if Passage A discusses something Passage B never mentions, mark it as unique to A. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Use different marking symbols</strong>—some students use straight underlines for Passage A and wavy underlines for Passage B, or checkmarks for A and asterisks for B. The goal is creating visual cues that help you quickly locate information and remember its source without rereading extensively. Your notation system doesn't need to be complex—even simple "A" and "B" labels beside key points can significantly reduce confusion when answering comparison questions.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Identifying the Relationship While Reading
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
As you read Passage B, actively <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">identify the relationship</strong> between the passages rather than treating them as independent texts. Ask yourself: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Do they agree or disagree on the main point?</strong> Some passages present opposing views (one supports a policy, the other opposes it), while others agree overall but differ in emphasis or specifics. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Do they focus on different aspects of the same topic?</strong> One might discuss causes while the other discusses effects; one might be theoretical while the other is practical; one might cover historical background while the other addresses contemporary implications. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Does one provide an example or case study of what the other discusses generally?</strong> Passage A might present a broad theory that Passage B illustrates through a specific instance. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Do they represent different perspectives or stakeholders?</strong> One might present a scientist's view while the other presents a policymaker's view. Identifying this relationship early helps you anticipate comparison questions and recognize relevant information as you read. By the time you finish Passage B, you should be able to articulate in one sentence how the passages relate: "Passage A argues for X while Passage B argues against X," or "Both support X but emphasize different reasons," or "Passage A provides historical context for the phenomenon that Passage B analyzes scientifically."
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Alternative Approach: Question-First Method
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Some students prefer a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">question-first approach</strong>: Quickly scan all 10 questions before reading either passage to identify which questions ask about A only, B only, or both. This preview shows you what to focus on while reading. Then read Passage A, answer A-only questions, read Passage B, and answer remaining questions. This method works well if you: tend to forget information quickly and benefit from knowing what to look for, are strong at active reading with specific targets in mind, or find that knowing the questions focuses your attention effectively. However, this approach has drawbacks: it takes time to read all questions first (30-45 seconds), it can create cognitive overload trying to remember many question focuses while reading, and you might miss important information not directly related to questions. Most students find the sequential method (read A, answer A questions, read B, answer all remaining) more efficient and less cognitively demanding. Experiment with both approaches during practice to determine which works better for your reading style. The key is having a systematic approach rather than randomly bouncing between passages and questions.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Sequential Method in Action</strong><br><br>
<strong>Step 1 - Read Passage A:</strong> A discussion of how social media platforms affect political discourse, arguing they increase polarization. Note main idea: "Social media increases polarization." Mark key evidence with "A."<br><br>
<strong>Step 2 - Answer Passage A Questions:</strong> Questions 21-23 ask about A only. Answer these while Passage A is fresh in memory. Takes ~2 minutes.<br><br>
<strong>Step 3 - Read Passage B:</strong> A discussion of the same topic but arguing social media can promote diverse viewpoints if used thoughtfully. While reading, note: "B disagrees with A—says social media can reduce polarization with right approach." Mark key evidence with "B."<br><br>
<strong>Step 4 - Answer Remaining Questions:</strong> Questions 24-26 ask about B only—answer these. Questions 27-30 are comparison questions asking how passages relate, where they agree/disagree, etc. Now you've engaged deeply with both and can tackle these efficiently.<br><br>
<strong>Advantage:</strong> Never holding both full passages in working memory simultaneously; answering questions while information is fresh; building understanding progressively.

3. Strategies for Comparison Questions
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Comparison questions require synthesizing information from both passages and understanding their relationships. Specific strategies help you answer these efficiently and accurately.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Agreement Questions: Finding Common Ground
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
When questions ask <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"Both authors would agree that..."</strong> or "Both passages discuss...", you must identify claims supported by both passages despite any differences in emphasis or perspective. Strategy: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Evaluate each answer against both passages</strong>—for an answer to be correct, both passages must support it. If even one passage contradicts it or doesn't mention it, <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Cross out wrong answer choices">eliminate</span> it. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Look for foundational agreements</strong>—even when passages disagree on conclusions or approaches, they often agree on basic facts, problem definitions, or underlying principles. For example, two passages might disagree about the solution to climate change but both agree that climate change is occurring and has significant effects. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Distinguish between agreement and emphasis</strong>—passages might both mention something without both emphasizing it; agreement questions typically ask what both passages support, not necessarily what both emphasize equally. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Beware of partial agreement</strong>—wrong answers often include claims that one passage strongly supports but the other only weakly mentions or doesn't address. For tricky agreement questions, verify the answer by pointing to specific locations in both passages that support the claim. If you can't find clear support in both, the answer is likely wrong.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Disagreement Questions: Identifying Contrasts
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Questions asking <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"The authors disagree about..."</strong> or "Unlike Passage A, Passage B..." require identifying genuine differences in position or emphasis. Strategy: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Distinguish between disagreement and different focus</strong>—true disagreement means passages take opposing positions on the same issue (one says X is beneficial, the other says X is harmful). Different focus means passages discuss different aspects without necessarily contradicting each other (one discusses causes, the other discusses effects). <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Look for explicit contrasts</strong>—the clearest disagreements involve passages making opposite claims about the same specific issue. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Verify both sides</strong>—confirm that Passage A actually supports one position and Passage B actually supports the opposite; wrong answers often misrepresent one passage's position. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check for silence vs. opposition</strong>—if Passage A discusses something Passage B doesn't mention, that's not disagreement, just different coverage. True disagreement requires both passages addressing the same point with opposing views. For example, if Passage A says "Policy X successfully reduced unemployment" and Passage B says "Policy X failed to reduce unemployment," that's clear disagreement. But if Passage A discusses unemployment effects while Passage B discusses inflation effects, that's different focus, not disagreement.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Response Questions: Predicting Reactions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Questions asking <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"How would the author of Passage B respond to the claim in lines X-Y of Passage A?"</strong> test your understanding of each author's perspective and your ability to predict how one would react to the other's arguments. Strategy: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">First, identify the specific claim</strong> in the referenced lines—what exactly is Passage A saying? <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Then, determine Passage B author's relevant position</strong>—what does Passage B say about this topic or related issues? <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Predict the response type</strong>—would they agree, disagree, qualify/nuance the claim, or provide additional evidence? <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Match tone and strength</strong>—if Passage B takes strong positions, the response answer should reflect that strength; if Passage B is measured and qualified, the response should be too. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Base responses on actual Passage B content</strong>—don't speculate about what the author might believe; stick to what's demonstrably supported by their passage. For example, if Passage A claims "Economic growth always benefits all social classes" and Passage B provides evidence that growth sometimes increases inequality, Passage B's author would likely respond by pointing to this evidence of unequal benefits, not by completely rejecting all positive effects of growth.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Relationship Questions: Describing How Passages Connect
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Questions asking <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"Passage B relates to Passage A by..."</strong> or "Compared to Passage A, Passage B..." require understanding the structural or rhetorical relationship between passages. Common relationships include: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Opposing arguments</strong>—passages take opposite positions on a debatable issue. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Supporting through example</strong>—one provides a specific example or case study of a general principle the other discusses. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Extending or elaborating</strong>—one provides additional information, context, or analysis building on the other. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Contrasting perspectives</strong>—passages present different viewpoints on the same phenomenon (scientific vs. humanistic, historical vs. contemporary, theoretical vs. practical). <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Problem and solution</strong>—one describes a problem while the other proposes solutions. Strategy: Identify the relationship while reading Passage B, then verify your understanding by confirming that the relationship explains how specific content in each passage connects. For example, if you identify "opposing arguments," you should be able to point to specific claims in A that B contradicts, and vice versa. The relationship should account for the overall structure and purpose of both passages, not just isolated details.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Answering Comparison Questions</strong><br><br>
<strong>Context:</strong> Passage A argues that standardized testing improves educational accountability; Passage B argues that standardized testing narrows curriculum and harms learning.<br><br>
<strong>Agreement question:</strong> "Both authors would agree that..."<br>
Wrong: "Standardized testing has no place in education" (only B would agree)<br>
Wrong: "Standardized testing effectively measures student learning" (only A would agree)<br>
Correct: "Standardized testing has significant effects on educational practices" (both discuss major impacts, even though they evaluate them differently)<br><br>
<strong>Disagreement question:</strong> "The authors disagree about..."<br>
Correct: "Whether standardized testing ultimately benefits students" (A says yes, B says no—clear opposition)<br><br>
<strong>Response question:</strong> "How would the author of Passage B respond to Passage A's claim that testing improves accountability?"<br>
Wrong: "By agreeing that accountability is important" (doesn't address the testing claim)<br>
Correct: "By arguing that accountability comes at the cost of educational quality" (acknowledges A's point but counters with B's concern about harmful effects)<br><br>
<strong>Relationship question:</strong> "Passage B relates to Passage A by..."<br>
Correct: "Presenting an opposing view on the value of standardized testing" (captures the fundamental disagreement)

4. Time Management and Advanced Tactics
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Paired passages present unique time management challenges because you must read and analyze two texts within approximately the same time frame as a single passage. Advanced strategies help you work efficiently without sacrificing accuracy.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Optimal Time Allocation
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
For paired passages, target approximately <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">8-9 minutes total</strong> (similar to single passages), allocated as: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">2-2.5 minutes reading Passage A</strong>—these passages are shorter than full passages, so you can read slightly faster while maintaining comprehension. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">1.5-2 minutes answering Passage A questions</strong> (typically 2-3 questions)—these should go quickly since the passage is fresh. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">2-2.5 minutes reading Passage B</strong>—same as Passage A, but you're also noting relationships to A. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">2.5-3 minutes answering Passage B and comparison questions</strong> (typically 5-7 remaining questions)—comparison questions may take slightly longer than single-passage questions because they require consulting both texts. This allocation assumes you're following the sequential method. If you consistently run over time on paired passages, analyze where you're losing time: Are you reading too slowly? Rereading too much because you didn't note information sources? Getting stuck on difficult comparison questions? Once you identify the bottleneck, you can address it specifically. Remember that paired passages shouldn't take significantly more time than single passages because the total word count is similar—you're reading approximately the same amount of text, just divided into two parts.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Efficient Information Retrieval for Comparison Questions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Comparison questions often require <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">verifying information in both passages</strong>, which can consume excessive time if you have to reread extensively. Strategies for efficient retrieval: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Use your margin notes</strong>—if you labeled key ideas with "A" or "B" and noted the main idea of each passage, you can quickly locate relevant information without rereading. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Remember the structure</strong>—typically, Passage A's main argument appears early (first 1-2 paragraphs), and Passage B's position is similarly frontloaded. For questions about overall positions, check these sections first. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Use process of elimination</strong>—for agreement questions, if you're certain Passage A doesn't support an answer, <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Cross out wrong answer choices">eliminate</span> it without checking Passage B. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Leverage earlier questions</strong>—the Passage A and Passage B questions you already answered reinforce your understanding of each passage's content and perspective, reducing the need to reread for comparison questions. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">For "both passages" questions, check whichever passage you're less certain about</strong>—if you're confident Passage A supports an answer, verify Passage B; if both seem to support it, it's likely correct. The goal is verifying answers efficiently rather than rereading both passages completely for each question.

When to Skip and Return
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Some comparison questions are more difficult and time-consuming than others. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Strategic skipping</strong> can improve your overall performance: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Skip questions requiring extensive passage searching</strong>—if a question asks you to compare specific details that would require rereading multiple paragraphs in both passages, skip it temporarily and answer questions that draw on main ideas or information you recall clearly. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Skip questions where you're uncertain about the answer after reasonable effort</strong>—if you've thought about a comparison question for 45+ seconds and still can't decide confidently between two options, make your best guess, mark it for review, and move on. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Return to skipped questions if time permits</strong>—after completing all other questions, you may have 1-2 minutes remaining. Use this time to revisit marked questions with fresh eyes. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Don't skip questions that seem hard but that you're making progress on</strong>—if you're methodically working through a question and narrowing down options, continue rather than restarting later. The key is avoiding time sinkholes where you spend 2+ minutes on a single question that remains unclear, sacrificing time that could earn points on easier questions.

Building Paired Passage Stamina
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Paired passages require sustained focus and mental energy to track two texts simultaneously and analyze their relationships. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Building stamina</strong> through practice improves performance: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Practice paired passages specifically</strong>—regularly work through paired passage sets (available in official ACT practice materials) to build comfort with the format. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Analyze your errors</strong>—when you get comparison questions wrong, determine whether the error came from misunderstanding one passage, confusing which passage said what, or misidentifying the relationship. Each error type requires different corrective strategies. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Time yourself</strong>—practice completing paired passage sets within 8-9 minutes to ensure you can work at the necessary pace. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Experiment with notation systems</strong>—try different ways of marking and organizing information to find what prevents confusion most effectively for you. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Review successful attempts</strong>—when you do well on paired passages, reflect on what worked so you can replicate successful strategies. With practice, paired passages become less intimidating and more routine, allowing you to approach them with the same confidence as single passages.

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Time Management in Practice</strong><br><br>
<strong>Paired Passage Timeline (9 minutes total):</strong><br><br>
<strong>0:00-2:15</strong> - Read Passage A (450 words), noting main argument: "Urban gardens improve community health." Mark key evidence with "A" in margin.<br><br>
<strong>2:15-3:45</strong> - Answer Questions 11-13 (Passage A only). Q11: Main idea of A. Q12: Detail from A. Q13: Author's purpose in A. (1.5 minutes for 3 questions)<br><br>
<strong>3:45-6:00</strong> - Read Passage B (450 words), noting it discusses urban gardens but emphasizes environmental benefits over health benefits. Note: "B agrees gardens good but different focus—environment not health." Mark key evidence with "B."<br><br>
<strong>6:00-7:15</strong> - Answer Questions 14-16 (Passage B only). Q14: Main point of B. Q15: What B suggests about gardens. Q16: Detail from B. (1.25 minutes for 3 questions)<br><br>
<strong>7:15-9:00</strong> - Answer Questions 17-20 (Comparison). Q17: Both passages discuss... Q18: Unlike A, B emphasizes... Q19: How would B author respond to A's health claims? Q20: Passages relate by... (1.75 minutes for 4 questions)<br><br>
<strong>Total:</strong> 9 minutes for 10 questions. Efficient use of notation and sequential method prevented confusion and excessive rereading.
