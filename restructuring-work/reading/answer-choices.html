Successfully navigating ACT Reading answer choices requires understanding how the test constructs <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">tempting wrong answers</strong>, learning to analyze each choice systematically using <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">comparison techniques</strong>, and developing efficient <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">evaluation strategies</strong> that maximize accuracy while minimizing time. Rather than reading answer choices passively and selecting the first option that sounds reasonable, strategic test-takers approach choices with skepticism, actively searching for flaws, comparing options systematically, and verifying selections against passage evidence. This lesson teaches you proven methods for evaluating answer choices, including the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">vertical reading technique</strong>, how to spot recycled passage vocabulary that disguises wrong answers, strategies for choosing between two close options, and how to avoid psychological traps that pull you toward incorrect answers.

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. The Systematic Approach to Reading Answer Choices
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Most students read answer choices horizontally—A, then B, then C, then D—and select the first one that seems good. A more effective approach involves <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">systematic evaluation</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">active comparison</strong>, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">deliberate verification</strong> before committing to an answer.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
The Vertical Reading Technique
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Vertical reading</strong> means reading all four answer choices before selecting any answer, physically marking each choice as you evaluate it. Rather than reading A and immediately deciding if it's correct, read all four choices, <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Cross out wrong answer choices">eliminate</span> obviously wrong answers, then carefully compare remaining options. This prevents you from settling for a mediocre answer when a better option exists in C or D. The process: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">First pass</strong>—quickly read all four choices to get a sense of the options. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Second pass</strong>—evaluate each choice more carefully, crossing out definitely wrong answers in your test booklet with an X or strikethrough. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Third pass</strong>—for remaining choices (typically 2-3), compare them carefully to identify which is best supported by the passage. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Verification</strong>—check your chosen answer one more time against the passage before bubbling.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Active vs. Passive Choice Evaluation
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Passive evaluation</strong> means reading each choice and waiting to "feel" if it's right—this approach makes you vulnerable to answers that sound sophisticated or use familiar passage vocabulary but are actually wrong. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Active evaluation</strong> means interrogating each choice with specific questions: "Does the passage actually support this?", "Is every part of this answer accurate?", "Does this fully address what the question asks?", "How does this compare to the other options?" Active evaluation transforms you from a passive receiver of information into an aggressive analyzer who demands evidence and proof. For each answer choice, force yourself to identify specific passage evidence that would support it. If you can't point to clear textual support, the answer is likely wrong. This evidence-demanding mindset is what separates scores in the 30-36 range from lower scores.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
The Elimination-First Strategy
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Rather than searching for the right answer, search for <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">wrong answers to <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Cross out wrong answer choices">eliminate</span></strong>. This reversal of focus often makes difficult questions easier because it's frequently simpler to spot what's wrong with an answer than to confirm what's right. For each choice, actively ask: "What's wrong with this answer? How does it contradict, distort, or go beyond the passage?" Even if you can't identify the correct answer immediately, eliminating two clearly wrong choices improves your odds from 25% to 50% if you must guess. The elimination-first mindset also protects against settling for the first "good enough" answer you see—by forcing yourself to find flaws in all choices before selecting one, you ensure thorough evaluation. Physically cross out eliminated choices in your test booklet with a clear X or strikethrough so you don't reconsider them. This visual elimination helps your brain focus on remaining viable options.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Managing Answer Choice Overload
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Sometimes all four answer choices seem plausible, or conversely, none seems perfect. When facing <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">answer choice overload</strong>, use these techniques: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Break down the question again</strong>—reread the question stem to ensure you understand exactly what's being asked. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Return to the passage</strong>—locate and reread the relevant section more carefully. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Compare extreme differences first</strong>—if one choice says "always increased" and another says "decreased," determine which the passage supports. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Look for "killing words"</strong>—single words that make an answer wrong (like "only," "never," "always" when the passage is more nuanced). <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Trust your first instinct</strong> only after thorough analysis—gut feelings can be valuable but should be confirmed by evidence.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Systematic Choice Evaluation</strong><br><br>
Question: "The author's primary purpose in the passage is to..."<br><br>
<strong>First pass (quick read):</strong><br>
A. Describe the history of photography<br>
B. Argue that digital photography is superior to film<br>
C. Explain how technological changes influenced artistic expression<br>
D. Criticize photographers who resist new technologies<br><br>
<strong>Second pass (elimination):</strong><br>
A. Too narrow—passage discusses photography but focuses on broader artistic implications (ELIMINATE)<br>
B. No argument about superiority—passage presents balanced view (ELIMINATE)<br>
C. Possible—passage does discuss technology and artistic impact<br>
D. Too extreme—passage doesn't criticize, just describes different approaches (ELIMINATE)<br><br>
<strong>Result:</strong> C is the only viable answer after systematic elimination.

2. Recognizing Trap Answers and Red Flags
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
The ACT deliberately constructs <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">trap answers</strong>—wrong choices designed to tempt you by sounding reasonable, using passage vocabulary, or appealing to common misconceptions. Learning to recognize these traps protects you from selecting attractive but incorrect answers.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
The Familiar Vocabulary Trap
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
One of the most common trap answers uses <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">words and phrases directly from the passage</strong> to create an illusion of correctness, but subtly twists their meaning or context. Students see familiar language and think "Yes, I saw those words in the passage!" without verifying that the answer choice uses them correctly. For example, if a passage states "The experiment, though initially promising, ultimately revealed significant limitations in the methodology," a trap answer might say "The experiment showed promising results"—this uses the word "promising" from the passage but ignores the crucial qualifier "initially" and the contradicting information about "significant limitations." To avoid this trap: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Don't trust familiar vocabulary</strong>—just because you recognize words doesn't mean the answer is right. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Verify the complete meaning</strong>—check whether the answer uses passage words in the same way and with the same qualifiers. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Read the full answer carefully</strong>—trap answers often start correctly but end with a subtle distortion.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
The Half-Right Trap
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Half-right answers</strong> contain some accurate information but also include a critical error, making them appear correct on quick reading but wrong upon careful analysis. These are particularly dangerous because students who skim the beginning of the answer choice think "That's right!" and select it without reading to the end. For example, a passage might discuss both the benefits and drawbacks of a policy. A half-right answer might accurately describe the benefits but wrongly claim the passage says there are "no drawbacks" when it actually discusses several. To avoid this trap: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Read every word</strong> of each answer choice, including the last few words where trap answers often hide their errors. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check all components</strong>—verify that every single claim in the answer is supported, not just most claims. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Be especially suspicious</strong> of long, detailed answers—they provide more opportunities to insert subtle errors.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
The Extreme Language Trap
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Answers using <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">absolute or extreme language</strong>—words like "always," "never," "all," "none," "impossible," "guaranteed," "only," "completely," or "exclusively"—are usually wrong because ACT passages rarely make such absolute claims. Most passages present nuanced, qualified positions rather than extreme certainties. For example, if a passage says "Most scientists believe climate change contributes to extreme weather," an answer saying "All scientists agree that climate change always causes extreme weather" is too extreme—it changes "most" to "all" and "contributes to" to "always causes." To avoid this trap: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Flag extreme language</strong>—circle or underline words like "always," "never," or "all" when you see them in answer choices. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check if the passage supports extremity</strong>—sometimes extreme language IS correct, but verify the passage actually makes such absolute claims. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Prefer moderate language</strong>—answers using "some," "many," "often," "suggests," or "may" are more likely correct because they reflect passages' typical nuanced tone.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
The Out-of-Scope Trap
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Out-of-scope answers</strong> discuss topics, make claims, or bring in information not mentioned in the passage. These answers often sound reasonable and might even be factually true in the real world, but they're wrong because they're not supported by the passage. For example, if a passage discusses renewable energy's environmental benefits, an out-of-scope answer might discuss "the economic advantages of renewable energy jobs"—this could be true, but if the passage never mentions economic or employment issues, the answer is wrong. To avoid this trap: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Ask "Is this in the passage?"</strong> for each element of the answer. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Distinguish between what's true and what's supported</strong>—answers must be passage-supported, not merely plausible. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Don't bring in outside knowledge</strong>—restrict yourself to information present in the passage. If you can't point to specific passage evidence supporting an answer claim, it's likely out of scope.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Recognizing Trap Answers</strong><br><br>
Passage states: "While some critics praised the film's innovative cinematography, others found its narrative structure confusing and overly complex."<br><br>
<strong>Familiar Vocabulary Trap:</strong> "The film received universal praise for its innovative approach" (uses "innovative" from passage but changes "some critics praised" to "universal praise"—WRONG)<br><br>
<strong>Half-Right Trap:</strong> "Critics appreciated the film's cinematography and admired its straightforward narrative" (first part right about cinematography, but "straightforward narrative" contradicts "confusing and overly complex"—WRONG)<br><br>
<strong>Extreme Language Trap:</strong> "All critics found the film's narrative completely incomprehensible" (changes "others found" to "all critics" and "confusing" to "completely incomprehensible"—too extreme, WRONG)<br><br>
<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> "The film received mixed reviews, with some praising its visual style while others criticized its complexity" (accurately captures the passage's nuanced presentation)
</p>


<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Strategies for Choosing Between Close Answers
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
After eliminating clearly wrong answers, you'll often face two choices that both seem reasonable. Developing <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">comparison techniques</strong> for these situations ensures you select the better answer rather than guessing randomly.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
The Side-by-Side Comparison Method
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
When deciding between two close answers, use <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">systematic comparison</strong>: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Identify the specific differences</strong>—what exactly distinguishes the two choices? Is it a difference in degree (some vs. many), tone (positive vs. neutral), scope (part of passage vs. whole passage), or specificity (general vs. detailed)? <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Return to the passage</strong> to determine which difference the text supports. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Look for passage evidence</strong> that decisively supports one answer over the other—often a single word or phrase in the passage will favor one choice. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Choose the more complete answer</strong> if one provides more relevant detail while the other is vague. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Choose the more cautious answer</strong> if one makes a strong claim while the other is more moderate and both are supported—ACT passages typically favor nuanced positions.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Precision vs. Vagueness
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
When comparing close answers, consider their <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">precision level</strong>. Sometimes the correct answer is more specific and detailed because it accurately captures passage content, while a wrong answer is vague or general to avoid being obviously wrong. For example, if the passage explains that "The artist's childhood poverty directly influenced her later paintings' focus on economic inequality," the precise answer "Her early experiences with poverty shaped her artistic themes about class disparities" is better than the vague "Her background influenced her art." However, the reverse can be true—sometimes a wrong answer is too specific, adding details the passage doesn't mention, while the correct answer is appropriately general. The key is determining <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">which level of specificity matches the passage</strong>. If the passage provides detailed information, the correct answer typically reflects that detail. If the passage discusses something generally, overly specific answers are likely wrong.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Checking for Completeness
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Sometimes two answers are both technically correct based on the passage, but one is <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">more complete</strong>—it captures more of what the passage conveys or addresses the question more fully. For example, if a question asks about the author's purpose and the passage both explains a concept AND argues for its importance, an answer mentioning both "to explain X and demonstrate its significance" is more complete than one saying only "to explain X." The ACT generally favors more complete answers when both are accurate. However, be careful: "more complete" doesn't mean "longer" or "more detailed"—an answer can be concise and complete. The test is whether the answer captures all relevant aspects of what the passage says on the topic, not how many words it uses. When comparing close answers, ask: "Which answer better captures the full scope of what the passage says about this topic?"
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
The "Cardinal Sin" Check
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Before finalizing your choice between close answers, check whether either commits a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"cardinal sin"</strong>—a fatal flaw that automatically disqualifies it: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Contradicts the passage</strong> (states the opposite of what the passage says), <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Makes an unsupported claim</strong> (asserts something the passage never states or implies), <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Uses extreme language</strong> the passage doesn't support (always/never when passage says sometimes), <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Brings in outside information</strong> (discusses topics not in the passage), <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Answers a different question</strong> (might be passage-supported but doesn't address what the question asks). If one answer commits a cardinal sin while the other doesn't, choose the one without the fatal flaw even if the flawed answer seems appealing in other ways. These disqualifying errors override other considerations.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Choosing Between Close Answers</strong><br><br>
After elimination, two choices remain:<br>
<strong>Choice B:</strong> "The author argues that technological change influenced artistic expression"<br>
<strong>Choice C:</strong> "The author examines how specific technological innovations transformed artists' creative approaches and subject matter"<br><br>
<strong>Analysis:</strong><br>
- Both are accurate based on the passage<br>
- Difference: C is more specific and complete<br>
- Return to passage: It does discuss "specific innovations" and mentions both "creative approaches" and "subject matter"<br>
- Choice C better captures the full scope of the passage's discussion<br><br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> C (more complete and precise)
</p>


<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Psychological Traps and Decision-Making Under Pressure
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Beyond content-based traps, students face <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">psychological and decision-making traps</strong> that affect answer choice selection, especially under time pressure. Recognizing these mental pitfalls helps you make better decisions.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
The Confirmation Bias Trap
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Confirmation bias</strong> means you tend to accept information that confirms what you already think and ignore information that contradicts it. On the ACT, this manifests as reading answer choices with a preconceived answer in mind, then selecting the first choice that matches your expectation without rigorously verifying it. For example, if you think the passage's main idea is about environmental conservation, you might select an answer mentioning conservation without noticing it mischaracterizes the passage's specific focus. To combat confirmation bias: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Force yourself to seriously consider all choices</strong>, even those that seem wrong at first glance. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Actively search for problems</strong> with your preferred answer rather than looking for reasons it's right. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Be willing to change your mind</strong> if evidence contradicts your initial impression. Maintain healthy skepticism even about answers you like.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
The First-Choice Bias
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Studies show students disproportionately select <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">answer choice A or B</strong>, even when C or D is correct, because they read A and B first and often don't carefully evaluate later choices. This "first-choice bias" causes students to settle for early answers without fully considering all options. Test makers exploit this by sometimes making A or B attractive but subtly wrong, while hiding the correct answer in C or D. To overcome first-choice bias: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Always read all four choices</strong>, no matter how perfect A seems. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Consider starting with D</strong> and working backward occasionally to break the habit of favoring early choices. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Check your practice test statistics</strong>—if you select A/B far more than C/D, you may have this bias. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Make a conscious effort</strong> to evaluate all choices equally regardless of position.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
The Overthinking Trap
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Overthinking</strong> happens when you've identified the correct answer but then talk yourself out of it by imagining far-fetched scenarios where it might be wrong, or by finding tiny imperfections that don't actually disqualify it. Students overthink when they: spend 2+ minutes on a question they've already answered, change answers multiple times, or convince themselves that correct answers "seem too obvious." To avoid overthinking: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Trust thorough analysis</strong>—if you've carefully verified an answer against the passage using systematic strategies, select it confidently. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Set a decision threshold</strong>—once you've evaluated all choices and verified your selection, commit to it and move on. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Remember: the best answer doesn't have to be perfect</strong>—it just has to be better than the other three options. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Only change answers</strong> if you have concrete evidence you made an error, not just vague unease.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Managing Decision Fatigue
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
By the time you reach the fourth passage and 40th question, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">decision fatigue</strong> can degrade the quality of your answer choice evaluation. Mental tiredness makes you more likely to rush, skip verification steps, or settle for "good enough" answers. To manage decision fatigue: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Maintain systematic processes</strong>—even when tired, follow your established choice-evaluation routine. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Take micro-breaks</strong>—after each passage, close your eyes for 3-5 seconds and take a deep breath before starting the next. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Build stamina through practice</strong>—regularly complete full 35-minute Reading sections to condition yourself to maintain quality decisions throughout. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Recognize fatigue warning signs</strong> (losing place, rereading repeatedly, impulsive choosing) and consciously refocus when they appear. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Remind yourself</strong> that the last few questions are worth the same points as the first few—maintain equal effort throughout.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Overcoming Psychological Traps</strong><br><br>
<strong>Situation:</strong> Question 38 of 40 (last passage, mentally tired). You read choice A and think "This matches what I remember—it's probably right." You start to bubble A.<br><br>
<strong>Psychological trap activated:</strong> First-choice bias (selecting A without reading others) + Confirmation bias (it matches your expectation) + Decision fatigue (too tired to check thoroughly)<br><br>
