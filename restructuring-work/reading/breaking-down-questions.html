Successfully answering ACT Reading questions requires the ability to <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">break down complex question stems</strong>, identify exactly what each question asks, recognize <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">key words and qualifiers</strong>, and avoid common misinterpretation traps. Many students miss questions not because they misunderstand the passage but because they misread what the question actually asks. This lesson teaches you systematic techniques for <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">deconstructing question stems</strong>, understanding the specific task each question requires, identifying signal words that guide your approach, and ensuring you answer the question that's actually being asked rather than the question you think you see. Mastering these question-analysis skills dramatically improves accuracy by ensuring you understand exactly what you're looking for before you start searching for an answer.

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
1. Understanding Question Stem Components
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Every ACT Reading question stem contains specific <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">components</strong> that define what the question asks and where to find the answer. Learning to identify and analyze these components ensures you fully understand each question before attempting to answer it.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
The Four Key Components of Question Stems
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Most Reading question stems contain four elements: the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">task verb</strong> (what you need to do—identify, determine, infer, conclude), the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">content focus</strong> (what topic or element the question addresses), optional <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">location markers</strong> (line numbers, paragraph references, or passage sections), and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">qualifiers or modifiers</strong> (words like "primarily," "mainly," "best," "most," "least," "NOT," or "EXCEPT"). Understanding each component helps you parse complex questions accurately. For example, in "The passage primarily suggests that the author's main purpose in discussing renewable energy is to...", the task verb is "suggests" (inference, not stated fact), content focus is "author's main purpose in discussing renewable energy," and the qualifier "primarily" indicates you're looking for the most important purpose, not necessarily the only one.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Identifying Task Verbs and What They Demand
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Task verbs</strong> tell you what cognitive process the question requires. Common task verbs include: "states," "indicates," "mentions" (detail questions—find explicit information), "suggests," "implies," "can be inferred" (inference questions—read between the lines), "most nearly means" (vocabulary questions—understand word in context), "primarily serves to," "functions to" (purpose questions—identify why content was included), "describes," "characterizes" (description questions—identify how something is portrayed), and "supports," "is supported by" (evidence questions—find textual support). Each verb demands a different approach. "States" requires finding explicitly stated information, while "suggests" requires drawing logical conclusions from implicit clues. Misreading "suggests" as "states" leads you to search for explicit information that doesn't exist, wasting time and likely causing an incorrect answer.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Using Location Markers Efficiently
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Location markers</strong> are gifts from the test-makers—they tell you exactly where to look. Common location markers include specific line references ("lines 23-28," "line 42"), paragraph references ("the third paragraph," "the opening paragraph"), section references ("the description of X," "the discussion of Y"), and quotation references ("when the narrator says," "where the author mentions"). When a question includes a location marker, ALWAYS use it. Go directly to those lines or that paragraph and read carefully, including 1-2 sentences before and after for context. Location markers save enormous time by eliminating the need to search the entire passage. However, be careful: sometimes the answer requires synthesizing information from the referenced section with information from elsewhere in the passage. Don't restrict yourself so narrowly to the referenced lines that you miss necessary context.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Recognizing and Respecting Qualifiers
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Qualifiers</strong> modify the task and often determine which answer is correct versus close-but-wrong. Pay special attention to: "primarily," "mainly," "chiefly" (indicates the most important purpose or reason among possibly several), "best" or "most" (indicates the strongest or most supported answer among several plausible options), "directly," "explicitly" (limits you to stated information, not inferences), "reasonable," "most likely" (allows for inferences based on strong support), "NOT" or "EXCEPT" (reverses the question—you're looking for what's false or unsupported, not true), and "according to" (restricts you to what the passage states, not outside knowledge). Missing a qualifier completely changes what the question asks. "Which best describes..." requires you to choose the most accurate description, not just any accurate one. "All of the following EXCEPT..." requires identifying the one statement that's NOT supported, while the other three are supported.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Breaking Down a Complex Question Stem</strong><br><br>
Question: "Based on lines 34-42, the author primarily suggests that the scientist's most significant contribution was..."<br><br>
<strong>Task verb:</strong> "suggests" → Inference question (not explicitly stated, must read between lines)<br>
<strong>Location marker:</strong> "lines 34-42" → Go directly to those lines<br>
<strong>Content focus:</strong> "the scientist's most significant contribution"<br>
<strong>Qualifier:</strong> "primarily" → Looking for the MAIN contribution among possibly several mentioned<br><br>
<strong>Strategy:</strong> Read lines 34-42 (plus context). Identify what contribution(s) are mentioned. Determine which one the passage emphasizes or treats as most important. Select the answer that matches this emphasis.
</p>


<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Avoiding Common Question Misinterpretation Traps
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Even careful readers can fall into <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">misinterpretation traps</strong> where they answer the wrong question, overlook crucial qualifiers, or confuse similar-looking question types. Recognizing these traps helps you avoid them.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
The NOT/EXCEPT Trap
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Questions containing <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">NOT or EXCEPT</strong> reverse the usual task—you're looking for the one statement that's FALSE or UNSUPPORTED while the other three are true or supported. Many students miss these questions because they read quickly, see three answer choices that seem right, pick one, and move on without realizing they needed to find the WRONG answer. These questions are typically capitalized to draw attention: "All of the following are mentioned in the passage EXCEPT..." or "Which of the following is NOT supported by the passage?" To avoid this trap: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Circle or highlight NOT/EXCEPT</strong> in the question stem when you see it. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Mark each answer choice</strong> as True or False (or Supported vs. Not Supported) as you evaluate it. Select the one marked False/Not Supported. This systematic approach prevents the common error of selecting a correct statement when the question asks for an incorrect one.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
The "Best" vs. "Any" Trap
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Many questions ask for the <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"best" answer</strong>—"Which of the following best describes...", "The author would most likely agree with...", "The primary purpose is to..." These questions often have multiple plausible answers, but only one is BEST. Students sometimes select the first answer that seems reasonable without checking whether a better option exists. To avoid this trap, evaluate ALL four answer choices before selecting, even if choice A seems perfect. Often choice C or D will be more precise, more complete, or better supported. Use comparative thinking: "Is this answer better than that one? Does this one capture more of what the passage conveys?" The best answer will be the most accurate, most complete, or most strongly supported, not just any answer that's technically correct. This is why eliminating obviously wrong answers first, then carefully comparing remaining options, is so effective—it forces you to choose the best among good options rather than settling for merely acceptable.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
The "Primarily" and "Mainly" Trap
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Questions using <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"primarily," "mainly," or "chiefly"</strong> ask about the MOST IMPORTANT purpose, reason, or function—not the only one. Students sometimes <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Cross out wrong answer choices">eliminate</span> correct answers because the passage mentions additional purposes beyond the one stated in the answer choice. For example, if a question asks "The paragraph primarily functions to..." and the passage both introduces a topic AND provides an example, the correct answer might be "introduce a topic" even though the paragraph also includes an example. The qualifier "primarily" indicates that introducing the topic is the main function, even if not the exclusive function. To handle these questions: identify all purposes or functions mentioned, determine which one the passage emphasizes most or devotes the most attention to, and select the answer reflecting that primary emphasis. Don't <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Cross out wrong answer choices">eliminate</span> answers just because they don't capture every minor detail—they should capture the most significant or most emphasized aspect.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
The Assumption Trap
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
One of the most insidious traps is answering based on <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">assumptions or outside knowledge</strong> rather than what the passage actually says. For instance, if a passage discusses a historical figure and a question asks "According to the passage, what motivated X to...", students who know this person's history might select an answer based on their knowledge rather than verifying it against the passage. The passage might not mention that particular motivation at all, or might present a different reason. Always ask: "Does the PASSAGE support this, or am I bringing in my own knowledge?" Similarly, don't make logical leaps based on what seems like common sense. If the passage doesn't state or strongly imply something, the answer can't be correct just because it seems likely to be true. Restrict yourself entirely to information present in or reasonably inferable from the passage itself.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Avoiding Misinterpretation Traps</strong><br><br>
Question: "All of the following are mentioned in the passage as effects of climate change EXCEPT..."<br><br>
<strong>Common mistake:</strong> Reading quickly, seeing choice A "rising sea levels" and thinking "Yes, that's mentioned!" and selecting it.<br><br>
<strong>Correct approach:</strong> Circle "EXCEPT" in the question. Check each answer against the passage:<br>
- Choice A: rising sea levels (mentioned in paragraph 3) → Mark TRUE<br>
- Choice B: extreme weather events (mentioned in paragraph 4) → Mark TRUE<br>
- Choice C: changes in migration patterns (mentioned in paragraph 5) → Mark TRUE<br>
- Choice D: reduction in solar radiation (NOT mentioned anywhere) → Mark FALSE<br><br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> Choice D (the one NOT mentioned).<br><br>
By systematically checking each and marking T/F, you avoid selecting a true statement when the question asks for the false one.
</p>


<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Translating Question Stems into Search Strategies
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Once you've broken down a question stem and identified what it asks, you need to translate that understanding into a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">concrete search strategy</strong>—a specific plan for finding the answer. Different question types require different search approaches.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Creating Your Search Plan for Detail Questions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
For <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">detail questions</strong> (question stems with "according to," "states," "mentions," or line references), your search plan is straightforward: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Go to the specified location</strong> (or search for keywords if no location is given), <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">read carefully</strong> (the referenced lines plus surrounding context), <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">identify what the passage explicitly states</strong> about the topic, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">match this information</strong> to an answer choice. For example, if the question asks "According to lines 34-37, the experiment's results were...", go to lines 34-37, read them and a sentence on each side, identify how the passage describes the results, and find the answer choice that paraphrases this description. This is a locate-verify-match process. The key is reading carefully enough to catch important qualifiers or details that distinguish correct from incorrect answers.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Creating Your Search Plan for Inference Questions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
For <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">inference questions</strong> (stems with "suggests," "implies," "can be inferred"), your search plan involves: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Locate relevant section(s)</strong> (using line references if provided, or identifying where the topic is discussed), <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">read for implicit meanings</strong> (what does the author's word choice, tone, or emphasis suggest?), <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">identify logical conclusions</strong> (what must be true based on what's stated?), and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">verify inferences</strong> are strongly supported (not wild leaps). For example, if a passage describes how a scientist "cautiously suggested" results while noting "significant limitations" in the methodology, you can infer the scientist wasn't fully confident in the findings—even though the passage never explicitly states "the scientist lacked confidence." Look for clues in descriptive language, comparisons, contrasts, and the author's rhetorical choices.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Creating Your Search Plan for Purpose Questions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
For <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">purpose questions</strong> (stems with "primarily serves to," "functions to," "included mainly to"), your search plan focuses on structural relationships: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Locate the referenced content</strong> (paragraph, example, quotation, etc.), <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">read before and after</strong> to understand how it connects to surrounding content, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">ask "why is this here?"</strong> (does it provide evidence, offer contrast, give background, illustrate a point, transition topics?), and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">identify the rhetorical function</strong> it serves in building the author's argument or narrative. For example, if a passage describes a historical event in paragraph 2, then gives a specific example in paragraph 3, the function of paragraph 3 is likely "to illustrate" or "to provide a concrete example of" the concept from paragraph 2. Think about the passage's architecture—how each part supports the overall structure.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Creating Your Search Plan for Main Idea Questions
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
For <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">main idea questions</strong> (stems with "primary purpose," "main idea," "passage as a whole"), your search plan is more holistic: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Review your understanding</strong> of the passage's overall topic and purpose, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">check the introduction and conclusion</strong> (they often state main ideas explicitly), <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">identify the common thread</strong> (what appears in most or all paragraphs?), and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">formulate a one-sentence summary</strong>, then match it to answer choices. Some students find it helpful to answer main idea questions last, after detail questions have forced them to reread and reinforce their understanding of the passage's content. For main idea questions, the correct answer should be broad enough to encompass the entire passage while specific enough to capture its unique focus—not so general it could describe any passage on the topic.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Question Type → Search Strategy</strong><br><br>
<strong>Detail Question:</strong> "According to lines 45-48, the artist's early training..."<br>
Search strategy: Go to lines 45-48 → Read plus context → Find what passage states about training → Match to answer<br><br>
<strong>Inference Question:</strong> "The passage suggests that the author views the discovery as..."<br>
Search strategy: Find where discovery is discussed → Note author's descriptive language and tone → Infer author's attitude → Match to answer<br><br>
<strong>Purpose Question:</strong> "The primary function of paragraph 3 is to..."<br>
Search strategy: Read paragraph 3 and surrounding paragraphs → Identify how it connects to the argument → Determine its rhetorical role → Match to answer<br><br>
<strong>Main Idea Question:</strong> "The main purpose of the passage is to..."<br>
Search strategy: Review overall understanding → Check introduction/conclusion → Summarize passage in one sentence → Match to answer
</p>


<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Practicing Question Breakdown for Speed and Accuracy
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Like all ACT skills, breaking down questions efficiently requires <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">deliberate practice</strong>. Initially, the analysis process will feel slow and methodical, but with repetition it becomes fast and automatic, ultimately saving time by reducing misreads and wrong approaches.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
The Question Analysis Practice Routine
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
To build question breakdown skills: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Practice with untimed analysis first</strong>—before answering questions, spend time breaking down each stem, identifying task verbs, qualifiers, and search strategies. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Annotate question stems</strong>—circle or underline key words (NOT, EXCEPT, primarily, best, suggests, according to) to make them visually prominent. <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Verbalize your analysis</strong>—for each question, articulate aloud or in writing: "This is a [question type] question asking me to [specific task]. I'll find the answer by [search strategy]." <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Review errors</strong>—when you miss questions, determine whether you misread what was asked or understood the question correctly but found the wrong answer. Often, question misreading is the culprit.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Building Speed Through Pattern Recognition
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
As you practice, you'll notice <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">patterns</strong> in how the ACT constructs questions. Certain phrase structures always signal certain question types: "most nearly means" → vocabulary question, "according to lines" → detail question, "suggests" or "implies" → inference question, "primarily serves to" → purpose question. These patterns become mental shortcuts that allow instant question-type recognition. Create a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">question stem cheat sheet</strong> listing common phrase patterns and what they signal, then quiz yourself until recognition is automatic. Once you can identify question types instantly, you can deploy appropriate strategies immediately without conscious analysis. This pattern recognition is what allows experienced test-takers to read a question stem in 2-3 seconds and immediately know exactly what approach to use.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Self-Monitoring for Question Misreads
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Develop <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">self-monitoring habits</strong> that catch misreads before you waste time on wrong approaches. After reading a question stem, pause for one second and ask: "What exactly is this question asking me to find?" If you can't articulate it clearly, reread the stem. Before selecting an answer, briefly reread the question stem to verify your chosen answer actually addresses what was asked. This quick double-check takes only 2-3 seconds but prevents many errors. Keep a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">misread log</strong> during practice—every time you misread a question, record what you thought it asked versus what it actually asked. Review this log to identify your personal misreading patterns (e.g., "I frequently overlook NOT/EXCEPT" or "I confuse 'suggests' with 'states'"), then create targeted strategies to address your specific weaknesses.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;">
Integration with Overall Reading Strategy
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
Question breakdown isn't a separate skill—it <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">integrates</strong> with your overall reading approach. If you use Read-Then-Answer, question breakdown helps you navigate questions efficiently after reading. If you use Skim-Then-Detail, question breakdown tells you exactly what sections to read carefully. If you use Questions-First, question breakdown is essential for understanding what to look for during reading. The goal is making question analysis so automatic that it doesn't feel like a separate step—you simply read a question stem and instantly know what type it is, what it's asking, where to look, and what approach to use. This automaticity comes from <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">extensive practice</strong> with conscious analysis that gradually becomes unconscious habit. Most students report that after 6-8 practice Reading sections with deliberate question breakdown practice, the process becomes natural and actually speeds up their overall performance.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong>Example: Speed Progression in Question Breakdown</strong><br><br>
<strong>Week 1 (Untimed Practice):</strong> Spend 20-30 seconds per question stem consciously identifying each component. "This is an inference question asking me to... I'll look in paragraph 3 where this is discussed and... The qualifier 'primarily' means I'm looking for the main reason, not necessarily the only reason..."<br><br>
<strong>Week 3 (Timed Practice):</strong> Spend 5-8 seconds per question stem with most analysis becoming automatic. Conscious focus only on unusual qualifiers or complex phrasings.<br><br>
<strong>Week 6 (Test-Ready):</strong> Spend 2-3 seconds per question stem. Recognition is instant for common question types. Conscious analysis only for tricky EXCEPT questions or complex multi-part questions.<br><br>
Through practice, what initially takes 30 seconds becomes a 3-second automatic skill, freeing mental energy for comprehension and answer selection.
