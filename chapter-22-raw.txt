The Basics of Probability
Probability is the likelihood of a desired outcome occurring compared to the total number of possible
outcomes. On the ACT, probability is usually listed as a fraction or, less commonly, a decimal or a
percentage.

Desired Outcome

Probability = All Possible Outcomes
The ACT often will phrase probability questions by asking you the probability of an event occurring. To

answer these questions, consider the event that you are counting and compare it to the total number of possible
outcomes.

To learn how probability works, let’s work through a few questions with the following example:
Example 1: A bag has a total of 38 chocolate candies. 18 of the candies are blue, 10 are red, 5 are
yellow, 3 are green, and 2 are pink.

Question 1: Andy will reach into the bag and pick one candy. What is the probability that he will grab a
yellow candy?
5

A=
33

B.

5

=

18

C.

5

—

38

10

D.
=
38

Solution: There is a total of 38 candies in the bag, and there are 5 yellow candies. Therefore, the probability

of selecting a yellow candy is = The answer is C.
Question 2: Evelyn is going to pick one piece of chocolate candy from the bag. What is the probability
that she will NOT pick a blue candy?

A.

9

=
19

B.

10

—

19

9

Cc. —
38

10

D.
—
38

Solution: There is a total of 18 blue candies in the bag, which means there are 20 candies that are not blue.

The probability of selecting a chocolate candy that is not blue is =, which simplifies to = The answer is B.
Pretty easy, right? Now, these questions get a bit more difficult when you have probabilities that involve
multiple events. It is important to remember that with multiple events, we multiply the probabilities of
each individual event together. Make sure that you remember to multiply fractions and not add them, as the
most common mistake students make 1s incorrectly adding the fractions when you are supposed to multiply.
Question 3: Min will select 2 chocolate candies from the bag without replacement. What is the
probability that Min will select a red candy and then a green candy?
A.

13

=

75

15

722

703

B—-|)—MrmRChs

13

D.
=
76

Solution: We have two probabilities. For the first probability, there are a total of 38 candies in the bag and 10

red candies, so the probability of selecting a red candy is = For the second probability, there are only 37
candies left in the bag since Min does not replace the first candy. There are still 3 green candies in the bag, so

the probability of the second candy being green is =. Since we have multiple events occurring in a row, we
multiply the probabilities together.

math

Simplifying the fraction, we get an answer of — The answer is C.
For questions like #3, make sure to read carefully to see if the selection is with replacement or without
replacement, as it changes the answer. If Min instead replaced the chocolate candy he selected the first time,
there would still be a total of 38 candies in the bag for the 2nd piece of candy he draws from the bag, so the
total probability instead would be
10
38

x

3

30

=

38

1,444

Questions like this are one of the most common types of probability questions, so make sure you understand
the difference between replacement and no replacement and how it affects the probability!
Example 2: Two fair six-sided dice are repeatedly rolled simultaneously. What is the probability that two

6’s are rolled on the 15th roll?

A=
3

B=6

c=
12

pbD-=36

Solution: The probabilities of rolling a 6 on each die is = Since we have multiple events occurring, we must
multiply the probabilities together to solve.

alr

1

xl=
6

1

=
36

The answer is D. The fact that the question says this is the 15th roll has no effect on the probability. It is just
there to confuse you!

3 Probability Rules to Know
There are three probability rules that you need to know for test day.
Rule #1 — The sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes is equal to 1.

For example, let’s think of a flipping a coin. The probability of flipping a head is =, and the probability of
flipping a tail is = Of course, = + - = 1. All coin flips must end in a head or a tail, so the sum of the
probabilities of those events must equal 1.
Example 3: In aclass of fifth graders, students were asked to pick their favorite lunch, and no student

was allowed to select more than one lunch as their favorite: - picked pizza, - picked chicken nuggets, —
picked pasta, and = picked tacos. What is the probability that a randomly selected student did not select
any of these lunches?

A

0

B 1600
3

c+

pH

Solution: All fifth graders selected a favorite lunch, so the sum of the fractions must add up to 1. We can use
the given fractions to find the fraction of students, x, who did not select any of the lunches.

To solve, we need to make the fractions all have a common denominator. Here, the least common
denominator is 20. If you need to review adding fractions, go back to Chapter 6.

Chapter 22: Probability

The fraction of students who selected none of the lunches is =, so the probability that a randomly selected

student picked none of the lunches is also = The answer is C.
Rule #2 — The probability of Event

A OR Event B occurring is the sum of the

probabilities of the individual events.

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)
Example 4: Kristina is on a game show where she plays three games for three different prizes. The first

game is for a toaster, the second game is for a couch, and the third game is for a new car. The probability
that she wins a toaster is 0.5, the probability that she wins a couch is 0.2, and the probability that she wins
anew car is 0.05. What is the probability that she wins a new car or a toaster?
A.

0.025

B. 0.25

C. 0.5

D. 0.55

Solution: Since we are finding the probability of winning a new car ORa toaster, we add the probabilities of
both events. The probability of winning a car or a toaster is the sum of the probability of winning a car, 0.05,
and the probability of winning a toaster, 0.5.

P(car or toaster) = P(car) + P(toaster) = 0.05 + 0.5 = 0.55
The answer is D.
Rule #3 — The probability of Event

A AND Event B occurring is the product of the

probabilities of the individual events.

P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B)
Example 5: The probability that Event A will occur is 0.3. The probability that Event B will occur is 0.7.

Given that Events A and B are mutually exclusive, what is the probability that Event A and Event B will
occur?
A.

0.21

B. 0.3

C. 0.5

D. 0.7

Solution: We are finding the probability that Events

A AND B occur, so we multiply the probabilities of the

individual events.

P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B) = 0.3 x 0.7 = 0.21
The answer is A.

Make sure that you memorize all 3 of these rules, especially rules #2 and #3, as those have appeared very often
on recent ACTs. As long as you know the rules, any probability questions with these rules should be easy!

Probability and Data Tables
The ACT can also give you a data table and ask you to identify the probability of a certain event occurring. It
is critical to read the question carefully and consider (1) what are the events that you are being asked to
identify (the numerator) and (2) what are the total events you are choosing from (the denominator). For these
questions, probability can be defined as
Number In Target Group

robabity = Total Number To Select From

Let’s see how to handle this with the example below:
The table below shows the results of a survey asking high school students in two different classrooms
about their preferred lunch.

Solution: We are asked to consider students from period 2, so we only look at the 29 students in period 2 not
at all students at the school. Of the students in period 2, 5 selected chicken tenders.

The answer is D.

Questions like these are the least common type of probability question on the ACT. That being said, they have
been on the test before and are 100% fair game to be on the test again. Whenever they do pop up, they are
usually easy to answer as long as you know how to read the table correctly.

Advanced Probability Questions
Advanced probability questions require you to find the probability for more complex events. These very
commonly appear at the end of the math test in questions 30-45. There is a high likelihood you will see one of
these questions on test day!
We will cover how to solve the most common types in the following examples.
Example 8: A fair spinner with 5 equally sized regions and an arrow has regions numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, and

5 respectively. A second fair spinner with 3 equally sized regions and an arrow has regions numbered 1,
2, and 3 respectively. The arrows are both spun at the same time and the numbers the two arrows land on
are added together. What is the probability that the sum is odd?

A5

B-+-3

c28

pe

Solution: To find the probability that the sum is odd, we need to find two things: (1) the number of
outcomes that add to an odd number and (2) the total number of possible outcomes. Let’s start by finding
the total number of possible outcomes.
The first spinner has 5 possible outcomes while the second spinner has 3 possible outcomes. To find the
total number of possible outcomes, we multiply

lst spinner

2nd spinner

Total

Outcomes

Outcomes

Outcomes

That’s the easy part. Now for the hard part. We need to find the total number of outcomes that add to an odd
number. The most reliable way to do this is to find an organized way to count the outcomes and keepa tally of
the odd numbers. To make our tally, we will use the following rule:
Odd + Odd = Even
Even + Even = Even

Odd + Even = Odd

To start, let’s say the first spinner lands on a 1. The second spinner could land on a 1, 2, or 3. Of these three
possible outcomes, only 1 + 2 sums up to an odd number, so we have 1 outcome in the tally.
Next, let’s say the first spinner lands on a 2. The second spinner could land on a 1, 2, or 3. Of these possible
outcomes, 2 + 1 and 2 + 3 add to an odd number, so we have 2 more outcomes to add to our tally (so 3 total).
Now, let’s say the first spinner lands on a 3. There is going to be 1 outcome that sums to an odd number. How
do we know this so quickly? Well, 1 and 3 are both odd, so we know that 3 will follow the same pattern that 1
did and will only have 1 outcome that sums to an odd number (3 + 2) We add 1 more to our tally (so 4 total).
What if the first spinner lands on a 4? Since 4 is even, we can use the pattern we found for 2. There are going

to be 2 outcomes (4 + 1 and 4 + 3) that sum to an odd number. We add 2 more to our tally (so 6 total).
Finally, if the first spinner lands on a 5, there is going to be 1 outcome (5 + 2) that sums to an odd number.
We add 1 more to our tally and find that there are 7 total outcomes that sum to an odd number.
So to find the probability, we do

For any question like this, it is critical to have an organized way of going through the possible outcomes and

tallying the ones we want to count. Example 8 just shows one type of question and one approach to solve, but
different questions will require different approaches. A good first step is to always draw a diagram and start

listing outcomes. If there is a pattern, as there was in Example 8, you will be able to spot it. If not, you can
just brute force your way to the answer by listing all possible outcomes and finding the probability from there.
Example 9: Kenji and David are members of a dinner club that will be meeting tonight. The 8 members

of the dinner club will be seated randomly around a table. What is the probability that Kenji and David
will be sitting next to each other at dinner?

A—15

B-7

C+5

»pD47

Solution: At first, this question seems extremely difficult to solve. There are so many places that Kenji and
David can sit and so many possible outcomes to deal with! You may be thinking about permutations and
combinations. No need for any of that complicated math. There is a quick and easy way to solve this
question: draw a diagram and assign one person a seat.

In the diagram below, each dash represents a chair. Let’s put Kenji in a chair.

Kenji

Now that Kenji is in a chair, what is the probability that David is randomly seated next to Kenji? Well, there

are 2 seats next to Kenji and a total of 7 seats left, so the probability that David is sitting next to Kenji is =
The answer is D.

Notice that the chair we put Kenji in does not matter. No matter what chair Kenji is randomly assigned to,
there are 2 seats next to him and 7 total seats left. We could have also assigned David to a seat and then done
the same thing with where Kenji can sit: there would be 2 seats next to David and 7 seats total. No matter how

we Set this up, the probability that Kenji and David are sitting next to each other is always =|
Example 10: Six volleyball players are going to be randomly split into two teams of 3. If Kim and Mary

are among the 6 players, what is the probability that they will be on the same team?

A. 25

B. ur

Solution: Draw a diagram of the situation and place one of the players on a team. Here, we will place Kim on
the Ist team.
Kim

What is the probability that Mary will be on the same team as Kim? There are 2 spots left on Kim’s team and

5 spots left overall, so the probability they will be on the same team is =. The answer is A.
Just like in our last example, no matter where we put Kim, there will be 2 spots left on that team and 5 spots

overall, so the probability will always be =

Advanced probability questions like examples 8-10 commonly appear at the end of the ACT, usually in
questions 35-45, and most students find them very difficult. However, using this simple diagram trick makes
questions like this quick and easy to solve!

Expected Value
The expected value is the outcome you expect for a probability based event, like how many questions you
might answer correctly if you guess on a multiply choice test. For example, if you guess randomly on a
60-question multiple-choice math test which choices A, B, C, and D, you can expect to get 25% correct (15 out
of 60).

The calculation behind this is simple: take the probability of an event occurring and multiply by the number of
events.

Expected Value = P(A) x A
Where P(A) is the probability that event A occurs and A is the number of times event A occurs. For our

multiple-choice test example, the probability of guessing an answer correctly is - and the number of questions
is 60, so

Expected Value = P(guess correctly) x number of questions = =x 60 = 15
If you guess randomly on the 60 questions, the expected number of correct answers is 15.
Example 11: A bag contains 12 identically sized, solid-colored balls. 3 balls are black, 5 are green, 2 are

blue, and 2 are yellow. A ball is drawn at random and returned to the bag, and the results are recorded. If
this experiment is conducted 600 times, how many times would a green ball be expected to be selected?
A.

100

B.

150

C. 250

D. 300

Solution: The probability of drawing a green ball is =, and the experiment will be conducted 600 times, so
Expected Value = = x 600 = 250
The answer is C.

This is the easy type of expected value question that would appear somewhere in the first 30 questions. More
advanced expected value questions will include multiple possible outcomes from the same event.
For example, let’s say that there are four cards on the table facedown. Each card has a number written on it,
which represents the amount of money the winner gets. If two cards have a 1, one card has a 3, and one card
has a 11, what is the expected value of playing the game?
The approach is the same as before, except that now we need to add the sum of all the expected values using
the equation

Expected Value = P(A) x A + P(B)xB+ P(C)xC...
P(A) is probability that events A occurs, and A is the payout for event A. P(B) is probability that events B
occurs, and B is the payout for event B, and so on for however many events there are. For our example, the
probability is the likelihood of picking a card with a certain number. The payout for each event is the number

on the card.

There are 2 cards with a 1, so the probability of randomly picking a card with a 1 on it is =. There is 1 card
with a 3, so the probability of randomly picking a card with a 3 on it is = There is 1 card with an 11, so the

- 213
-

math

probability of randomly picking a card with a 11 on it is = Using the expected value equation above, we can
solve:

Expected Value = = x 1 + =x 3+ = x 11 = = 4

The expected value of drawing a card is =, or $4.00. Since the card numbers are only 1, 3, and 11, the winner
will never get exactly $4.00, but that is the average payout expected based on the probability and payouts.
Example 12: Terry is playing a game involving ten identical cards in a deck. Each card has a single

number written on it: 4 cards have a 2, 3 cards have a 5, 2 cards have a 10, and 1 card has a 25. Terry will
choose a card at random, and he will be awarded the number of points equal to the number written on the
card. What is the expected value for the number of points that Terry will be awarded if he draws 1 card?
A.

4.4

B. 5

C. 6.8

D. 7.5

Solution: To find the expected value, we need to multiply the probability of each event occurring by the

points awarded from each event, which is just the number on the card. The probability of drawing a 2 is =, the
probability of drawing a 5 is =, probability of drawing a 10 is = and probability of drawing a 25 is =
Putting this in our expect value equation, we get:

Expected Value =+x24+2x54+2x10+—x25= 68
10

10

10

10

The answer is C.

Advanced expected value questions like Example 12 will most likely appear at the end of the test in questions
35-45. Students aiming for top math scores should memorize how to set this up.
