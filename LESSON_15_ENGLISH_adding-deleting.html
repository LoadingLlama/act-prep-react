<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">
<strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Adding or deleting information questions</strong> test your ability to evaluate whether a sentence or phrase belongs in a passage, requiring you to assess <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">relevance</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">redundancy</strong>, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">logical flow</strong>. These questions ask "Should the writer add this sentence?" or "Should the writer delete the underlined portion?" and require you to understand the paragraph's <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">main idea</strong> and determine whether the proposed addition or deletion strengthens or weakens the passage. Answering correctly requires not just deciding yes or no, but selecting the reason that best explains your decision.

1. Understanding Adding/Deleting Questions
</h3>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Question Format and Structure
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
Adding/deleting questions follow a predictable format that requires a two-part answer:
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Adding questions:</strong> Present a sentence in a box or brackets and ask: "Should the writer make this addition here?"
</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7;">
<li>Choices A and B answer "Yes" with different reasons</li>
<li>Choices C and D answer "No" with different reasons</li>
<li>You must decide both whether to add AND which reason is correct</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Deleting questions:</strong> Underline a portion of text and ask: "Should the writer delete the underlined portion?"
</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7;">
<li>Choices F and G answer "Yes, because" with different reasons</li>
<li>Choices H and J answer "No, because" with different reasons</li>
<li>Again, you must decide both whether to delete AND which reason is correct</li>
</ul>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">
<strong>Example format:</strong>
<br><br>
[The team spent three months analyzing data from over 500 participants.]
<br><br>
Should the writer make this addition here?
<br><br>
A. Yes, because it provides specific information about the scope of the research.<br>
B. Yes, because it explains why the research took so long to complete.<br>
C. No, because it repeats information already provided earlier in the paragraph.<br>
D. No, because it distracts from the paragraph's focus on the research findings.
</p>
</div>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
The Two-Step Decision Process
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
Approach these questions systematically with two separate decisions:
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Step 1: Should the information be added/kept or not?</strong>
</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7;">
<li>Read the proposed addition or underlined deletion carefully</li>
<li>Consider whether it's relevant to the paragraph's main idea</li>
<li>Determine if it adds value or creates problems (redundancy, distraction)</li>
<li>This narrows your choices to two options (either both "Yes" or both "No")</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Step 2: Which reason is accurate?</strong>
</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7;">
<li>Compare the two remaining reasons carefully</li>
<li>One reason will be factually accurate, the other will contain an error</li>
<li>Check each reason against the actual content and context</li>
<li>Select the reason that correctly describes the situation</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Reading Context Carefully
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
To answer these questions accurately, you must understand:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7;">
<li><strong>The paragraph's main idea:</strong> What is this paragraph primarily about?</li>
<li><strong>What precedes and follows:</strong> Read 2-3 sentences before and after the proposed addition/deletion</li>
<li><strong>The paragraph's purpose:</strong> Is it describing, explaining, arguing, narrating?</li>
<li><strong>Information already provided:</strong> Watch for redundancy with nearby sentences</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
This context determines whether the information is relevant and necessary or whether it should be excluded.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Evaluating Additions
</h3>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
When to Add Information
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
Add the proposed sentence when it:
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Provides relevant, specific support:</strong> The addition offers concrete details, evidence, or examples that directly relate to and strengthen the paragraph's main idea.
</p>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">
<strong>Context:</strong> A paragraph describes how Dr. Chen developed a new surgical technique.
<br><br>
<strong>Proposed addition:</strong> [This technique reduced average recovery time from six weeks to just ten days.]
<br><br>
<strong>Should add:</strong> Yes, because it provides specific, measurable evidence of the technique's benefit, directly supporting the paragraph's discussion of Dr. Chen's innovation.
</p>
</div>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Clarifies or explains necessary information:</strong> The addition helps readers understand complex ideas or processes described in the paragraph.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Provides essential context:</strong> The addition supplies background information needed to understand the paragraph's main points.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Creates necessary transitions:</strong> The addition logically connects ideas that would otherwise seem disconnected.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
When NOT to Add Information
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
Do NOT add the proposed sentence when it:
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Repeats information already stated:</strong> The most common reason to reject an addition is redundancyâ€”if the information is already conveyed elsewhere in the paragraph, adding it creates unnecessary repetition.
</p>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">
<strong>Context:</strong> Previous sentence states: "The museum houses over 10,000 artifacts from ancient Egypt."
<br><br>
<strong>Proposed addition:</strong> [The museum's collection includes thousands of items from Egyptian civilization.]
<br><br>
<strong>Should NOT add:</strong> No, because it repeats information that was already clearly stated in the previous sentence.
</p>
</div>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Goes off-topic or distracts:</strong> The addition may be interesting or even true, but if it doesn't directly support the paragraph's main idea, it's a distraction.
</p>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">
<strong>Context:</strong> A paragraph focuses on how architect Maya Lin designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial to honor fallen soldiers.
<br><br>
<strong>Proposed addition:</strong> [Lin also designed the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama.]
<br><br>
<strong>Should NOT add:</strong> No, because while true, it shifts focus from the Vietnam Veterans Memorial (the paragraph's topic) to a different project.
</p>
</div>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Contradicts or confuses:</strong> The addition creates logical inconsistencies or makes the passage harder to understand.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Provides irrelevant detail:</strong> The information is too specific, technical, or tangential for the passage's scope and audience.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Evaluating the Reasons
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
Once you've decided whether to add or not, carefully evaluate which reason is accurate:
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Check factual accuracy:</strong> Does the reason correctly describe what the proposed addition actually does? For example, if the reason says "it provides statistical evidence" but the addition doesn't contain statistics, that reason is wrong.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Verify the claim:</strong> If the reason says "it repeats information from earlier," check whether that information truly appears earlier. If it doesn't, that reason is incorrect even if you've decided not to add the sentence.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Assess relevance claims:</strong> If a reason says the addition is relevant or irrelevant to the paragraph's focus, verify this against the paragraph's actual main idea.
</p>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">
<strong>Example:</strong> A paragraph discusses the economic impact of a new factory.
<br><br>
<strong>Proposed addition:</strong> [The factory created 500 new jobs in the community.]
<br><br>
A. Yes, because it provides specific evidence of the factory's economic impact.<br>
B. Yes, because it explains the factory's manufacturing process.<br>
C. No, because this information appears earlier in the essay.<br>
D. No, because it distracts from the paragraph's focus on environmental concerns.
<br><br>
<strong>Analysis:</strong> The addition should be made because it provides relevant, specific evidence. Between A and B, only A is factually accurateâ€”the sentence discusses jobs (economic impact), not manufacturing process.
<br><br>
<strong>Answer: A</strong>
</p>
</div>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Evaluating Deletions
</h3>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
When to Delete Information
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
Delete the underlined portion when it:
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Repeats information unnecessarily:</strong> The most common valid reason for deletion is redundancy. If the same information is clearly stated elsewhere, the redundant portion should be deleted.
</p>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">
<strong>Example:</strong> "The ancient temple, which was built in ancient times, features intricate carvings."
<br><br>
<strong>Should delete:</strong> Yes, because "ancient" already indicates the temple was built long ago, making "which was built in ancient times" redundant.
</p>
</div>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Goes off-topic:</strong> The underlined portion introduces information unrelated to the paragraph's main focus, distracting from the central idea.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Creates wordiness without adding value:</strong> The underlined portion uses many words to say what could be said more concisely, or adds no meaningful information.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Contradicts other information:</strong> The underlined portion conflicts with facts or ideas presented elsewhere in the passage.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
When NOT to Delete Information
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
Keep the underlined portion when it:
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Provides necessary detail or support:</strong> The underlined portion offers specific information, evidence, or examples that strengthen the paragraph's main idea.
</p>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">
<strong>Context:</strong> A paragraph discusses an athlete's dedication to training.
<br><br>
<strong>Sentence:</strong> "She practiced six hours daily, including two hours of strength training and four hours perfecting technique."
<br><br>
<strong>Should NOT delete underlined portion:</strong> No, because the specific breakdown of how the six hours were spent (strength training vs. technique) provides valuable detail that illustrates her comprehensive training approach.
</p>
</div>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Creates necessary connections:</strong> The underlined portion provides transitions, explanations, or context needed for logical flow.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Offers relevant elaboration:</strong> The underlined portion expands on an idea in a way that enhances understanding without being redundant.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Maintains the sentence's core meaning:</strong> Deleting the portion would remove essential information or make the sentence unclear or incomplete.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Common Deletion Question Traps
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
Be aware of these common patterns in wrong answers:
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Incorrect redundancy claims:</strong> A reason might claim something is redundant when it actually provides new, specific information that builds on (rather than repeats) earlier content.
</p>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">
<strong>Example:</strong> Previous sentence says "The river is polluted." Next sentence says "Chemical runoff from three nearby factories has contaminated the water with mercury and lead."
<br><br>
<strong>Wrong reason:</strong> "Yes, delete because this information is already stated in the previous sentence."
<br><br>
<strong>Why it's wrong:</strong> The second sentence doesn't repeat that the river is pollutedâ€”it provides specific details about the source (factories) and type (mercury, lead) of pollution. This is elaboration, not redundancy.
</p>
</div>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Misidentifying relevance:</strong> A reason might claim the information is off-topic when it actually relates directly to the paragraph's focus, or vice versa.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Overstating importance:</strong> A reason might claim the information is "essential" or "necessary" when it's actually just mildly relevant or tangential.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Mischaracterizing content:</strong> A reason might claim the underlined portion "explains the process" when it actually provides an example, or "gives historical background" when it discusses current applications.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Strategic Approach and Practice
</h3>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Systematic Method
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
Follow this step-by-step approach for all adding/deleting questions:
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Step 1: Read the surrounding context.</strong> Read 2-3 sentences before and after to understand the paragraph's main idea and how ideas flow.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Step 2: Identify the paragraph's focus.</strong> Ask yourself: "What is this paragraph primarily about?" This helps you judge relevance.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Step 3: Read the proposed addition or underlined deletion.</strong> Understand exactly what information would be added or removed.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Step 4: Make your add/delete decision.</strong> Ask:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7;">
<li>Is this information relevant to the paragraph's main idea?</li>
<li>Does it add new, valuable information or repeat what's already stated?</li>
<li>Does it strengthen the passage or distract from its focus?</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
This eliminates two answer choices, leaving you with two options.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Step 5: Evaluate the two remaining reasons.</strong> Check each reason against the actual content:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7;">
<li>Is the reason factually accurate about what the addition/deletion does?</li>
<li>Does it correctly identify why the information should or shouldn't be included?</li>
<li>Does it match the paragraph's actual focus and existing content?</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Step 6: Select the answer with the correct reason.</strong> Even if both reasons seem plausible, one will be more accurate. Choose the one that best describes the actual situation.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Distinguishing Redundancy from Elaboration
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
One of the trickiest aspects of these questions is differentiating between redundancy (which should be deleted or not added) and elaboration (which adds value):
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Redundancy:</strong> Repeating the same information in different words without adding new details or insights.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<em>Example:</em> "The building is tall. The structure rises high into the air." (Second sentence adds no new information)
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<strong>Elaboration:</strong> Building on a general statement with specific details, examples, or explanations.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
<em>Example:</em> "The building is tall. At 75 stories, it dominates the city skyline and can be seen from 20 miles away." (Second sentence provides specific details that support and expand the first)
</p>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">
<strong>Key distinction:</strong> Elaboration provides new information (how many stories, how far visible, impact on skyline) while redundancy just restates the same idea (tall = rises high).
</p>
</div>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Time Management
</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0;">
Adding/deleting questions require more reading than typical grammar questions but should still be answered efficiently:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7;">
<li><strong>Budget 45-60 seconds:</strong> You need time to read context and evaluate reasons, but don't exceed one minute</li>
<li><strong>Focus your reading:</strong> You don't need the entire passageâ€”just 2-3 sentences of context around the addition/deletion</li>
<li><strong>Decide add/delete first:</strong> This immediately eliminates half the choices, making reason evaluation more efficient</li>
<li><strong>Trust clear evidence:</strong> If one reason contains a factual error or mischaracterization, eliminate it confidently</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">
Practice with Complete Examples
</h4>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">
<strong>Example 1 (Addition):</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>Context:</strong> Maria Rodriguez transformed urban farming in Chicago by converting vacant lots into productive gardens. She began with a single plot in 2005 and now oversees 47 community gardens across the city.
<br><br>
<strong>Proposed addition:</strong> [These gardens produce over 50,000 pounds of fresh vegetables annually, providing food for more than 2,000 families.]
<br><br>
At this point, the writer is considering adding the following sentence. Should the writer make this addition here?
<br><br>
F. Yes, because it provides specific data that demonstrates the scale and impact of Rodriguez's work.<br>
G. Yes, because it explains the agricultural techniques Rodriguez uses in the gardens.<br>
H. No, because it contradicts information presented earlier about the number of gardens.<br>
J. No, because it distracts from the paragraph's focus on Rodriguez's background and education.
<br><br>
<strong>Analysis:</strong>
<br>
<strong>Step 1:</strong> Should we add this? Yesâ€”the addition provides specific, relevant evidence about the impact of the gardens described in the previous sentence.
<br>
<strong>Step 2:</strong> This eliminates H and J. Between F and G, which is accurate?
<br>
- F correctly identifies that the sentence provides specific data (50,000 pounds, 2,000 families) showing scale and impact
<br>
- G is wrongâ€”the sentence doesn't explain agricultural techniques; it provides outcome data
<br><br>
<strong>Answer: F</strong>
</p>
</div>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">
<strong>Example 2 (Deletion):</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>Context:</strong> The volcano's eruption lasted six hours. During this time, lava flows destroyed 200 homes and displaced 3,000 residents, while ash clouds disrupted air travel across the entire region.
<br><br>
The writer is considering deleting the underlined portion. Should the writer make this deletion?
<br><br>
A. Yes, because this information is already stated earlier in the paragraph.<br>
B. Yes, because it distracts from the paragraph's focus on the volcano's geological history.<br>
C. No, because it provides specific examples of the eruption's impact on the community.<br>
D. No, because it explains why the eruption lasted six hours.
<br><br>
<strong>Analysis:</strong>
<br>
<strong>Step 1:</strong> Should we delete this? Noâ€”the underlined portion provides specific, relevant details about the eruption's impact.
<br>
<strong>Step 2:</strong> This eliminates A and B. Between C and D, which is accurate?
<br>
- C correctly identifies that the sentence provides specific examples of impact (homes destroyed, residents displaced, air travel disrupted)
<br>
- D is wrongâ€”the sentence doesn't explain why the eruption lasted six hours; it describes what happened during those six hours
<br><br>
<strong>Answer: C</strong>

<span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: 600;">âœ“</span> Add information when it provides relevant, specific support for the paragraph's main idea; don't add when it's redundant, off-topic, or distracting

<span style="color: #2e7d32; font-weight: 600;">âœ“</span> Delete information when it repeats what's already stated, goes off-topic, or adds no value; keep it when it provides necessary detail or creates logical connections
