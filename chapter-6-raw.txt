Chapter 6: Fractions
For success on the ACT, you will need to be comfortable with fractions. Fractions are one of those topics that
many students hate. If you are one of those students, fear not! In this chapter, we will cover all the
fundamental techniques that will allow you to answer any question involving fractions quickly and efficiently.

1. Combining Fractions
To add or subtract fractions, we must make the denominators the same by finding the least common
multiple of the numbers or expressions in the denominators. For example, consider adding the fractions
below:
1

2

2

5

Here, the least common denominator is 10. An easy trick to find a common denominator is to multiply the
numbers in the denominator together. For the fractions above, 2 x 5 = 10. Once we find the least common
denominator, we can convert all fractions to have the same common denominator and then combine.

On the ACT, you will often see questions with expressions in the denominators instead of just numbers. These
are more difficult, but the concept and approach are the exact same.

Example 1:

=x 4,04
x—4

Which of the following is equivalent to the equation above for x + 0 and x # 4?
4x—-4

x(x-4)

B

4

"

4x-12

2x-4

"

x-1

x-4

*

x(x-4)

Solution: To start, we need to find the common denominator. Here, the common denominator is the product

of the two denominators: x(x — 4). We need to multiply the top and bottom of each fraction by the term they
are missing in the denominator.

1x74

x—-A4

3x

x—-4+4+3x

4x —4

7 x@—4) | x@—4) — x(x-4) x(x -4)

The answer is A.

Shortcut Solution — Substitution: For any “equivalent” questions like this one, we can also use the method
we discussed in Chapter 2 and plug in a value for x.

2. Dividing Fractions
Let’s say that you are solving a question and get
2

1

3°75
To solve for x, we divide both sides by = How do we divide a fraction by a fraction? Take the fraction on
the bottom, flip it to get the reciprocal, and then multiply the reciprocal by the top fraction. This of
often referred to as “keep, flip, change.” It’s as easy as that!

Chapter 6: Fractions

We can use this method any time we are dividing by a fraction even if the right side is a whole number. For
example, if we have
=-x =3

To solve, we need to divide both sides by <, so we use the same trick of flipping the fraction and multiplying
by the reciprocal.

,
Example 2:

Sp
beet
gt tz=3

For the equation above, what is the value of x?

A+
30
2

B+
45

c-3

pd?3

Solution: First, we need to combine like terms by subtracting - from both sides.
3.

11

4° "3° 5
Next, we need to combine the numbers on the right side by finding the common denominator. For 3 and 5, the
least common denominator is 15.

Now, substitute this back into the equation.
3

2

4° ~ 15
To isolate x, we divide both sides by =, so we flip the fraction and multiply by the reciprocal.

*=75*3

3° 45

The answer is B.

3. Simplifying Fractions
When simplifying fractions, you must be able to divide all terms in the numerator and denominator by

the same number. Simplifying fractions with only numbers is easy.
6

3

2

15°35
Many students struggle when there are multiple terms in the numerator or denominator. Let’s start with a
variable in the numerator.
2x + 10
4

Can we simplify this fraction? Yes, but only if we can divide all terms by the same number. Here, we can
divide every term by 2, so we can simplify the fraction.
2x+10
4

2 x+5
2

- 43
-

2

math

Many students will make a mistake and only divide the first term by 2 and not the 10 like this:
2x+10

4

*

x+10

2

WRONG! You must divide all terms by the same number to simplify. If you cannot divide all terms by
the same number, you cannot simplify the fraction. For example, if we instead had
8x +3
4

we can no longer simplify this fraction, but we can split this fraction into two:

4

4

4

4

If you cannot simplify a fraction by dividing all terms by the same number, you should look to split and
simplify the fraction this way.

The same concept applies for simplifying fractions when we have variables in the denominator.
3
6x + 30

Can we simplify this fraction? Yes, all terms can be divided by 3, so we can simplify the fraction.
3

3

6x+30

1

3.2x+10

Again, make sure that you divide all terms by the same number. If you cannot divide all terms by the same
number, the fraction cannot be simplified. For example, if we had
3
6x
+ 10

we cannot simplify the fraction. While we just saw that you can split up the numerators of a fraction, you
cannot split up the denominators.
3

3

3

6x + 10 * 6x u 10
We cannot simplify a fraction like this one at all.
Example 3:

12x+2

1

6

3

Which of the following is equivalent to the equation above?

A.

2xt=

B 2x+= C 4x+2 D. 4x45

Solution: First, we need to make the denominators the same, so we can combine the fractions. The least
common denominator of 3 and 6 is 6.
12x+2

6

1.2

12x+2

'3*2

2.12x+4

6

Next, we simplify the fraction. All the terms can be divided by 2.

6x+2

Finally, we can split the numerator and simplify to solve.
6xt2

_ Ox

2 _,

3.

12

3.3 *T3

The answer is B.

Shortcut Solution — Substitution: For any “equivalent” questions like this one, we can also use the method
we discussed in Chapter 2 and just plug in a value for x.

4. Getting Rid of Fractions
For questions with only numbers in the denominator, it is usually easiest to get rid of the fractions. We can
get rid of the fractions by multiplying both sides by the least common multiple of the numbers in the

denominator. The least common multiple is the same as the least common denominator we discussed earlier
in this chapter.
1

1

3

4% t= 8%

The least common multiple of 4, 2, and 8 is 8, so we can multiply all terms by 8 to eliminate the fractions.
1
1
3
—-xx8+--x8 = gxx8
4
2

The equation becomes
2x+4= 3x

Now, solving is easy!
x=4

If you struggle with fractions, always use this method to turn fractions into whole numbers.

Example 4: If = = = = - = aa what is the value of x?
A.

10

B. 6

C. 5

@)

D. 3

Solution: Since all the terms in denominator are numbers, we can get rid of the fractions. The least common
multiple of 5, 6, 2, and 10 is 30, so we can multiply all of the terms by 30.
3x

2x

|= *%30— = x 30

1

x

— 5 Xx 30 = To * 30

18x — 10x —15 = 3x
8x —15
= 3x
8x = 3x +15
5x
= 15
x=3
The answer is D.

Shortcut Solution — Backsolve: Rather than doing all of the math, plug the answer choices back into the
original equation to see which one makes the equation true.

5. Turn Fractions into Decimals
If you really hate fractions, another trick is to turn fractions into decimals. You can always turn fractions into
decimals using your calculator.
Example 5:

3

4

1

4

10

2

-xX-—=-x

For the equation above, what is the value of x?

A=
25

B425

ci2

pé5

Solution: We can change the fractions to decimals.
0.75x — 0.4 = 0.5x

Now, we solve for x algebraically.
0.75x = 0.5x + 0.4
0.25x = 0.4
_

04

«= 0.25
Using your calculator, we can find the value for x.
x=1.6

To tell which answer choice 1s equivalent to 1.6, we can plug the answer choices into the calculator to see
which one is equal to 1.6. The correct answer is D.

6. Use Your Calculator
Did you know that your calculator can solve most fractions questions for you? Almost all calculators have
the capability to turn a decimal into a fraction and vice versa. This can make fractions questions on the
ACT far easier and faster to solve.

The steps below outline how to use the fractions function in two of the most popular types of calculators.

If you have any other type of calculator than the 2 listed above, go to YouTube and look up a tutorial for how
to turn fractions into decimals for your calculator.
If your calculator cannot turn fractions into decimals and you solve for the correct answer in decimal form, you
can enter fractions in the answer choices into your calculator to convert them to decimals to find which one
matches the answer you found.
