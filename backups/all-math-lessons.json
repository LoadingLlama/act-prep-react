    "content": "<div class=\"lesson-content\">\n<p>In the first two lessons, you will learn two important test-taking techniques: backsolving and substitution. As you work through these lessons, use these techniques whenever you can to solve questions.</p>\n\n  <h3>What is Backsolving?</h3>\n\n  <p>Backsolving is plugging the answer choices back into the question. On the ACT, you are given 4 answer choices for multiple choice questions, and one of those 4 choices must be correct. Rather than solving the question algebraically and determining whether your answer matches one of the answer choices, you can guess-and-check with the answer choices to find which one is correct.</p>\n\n  <p>Backsolving is often the fastest and easiest way to solve ACT questions, especially if you get stuck and cannot solve a question algebraically, so use it to your advantage.</p>\n\n  <h3>How to Backsolve: 5 Steps</h3>\n\n  <ol>\n    <li><strong>Start with B or C.</strong> Plug the value in the answer choice back into the question. The answer choices are always in order of smallest to largest or largest to smallest, so starting in the middle saves you time.</li>\n    <li><strong>Solve the question using this value.</strong> Find any other unknowns if necessary.</li>\n    <li><strong>If this answer choice works correctly, you're done!</strong> Bubble it in and move on.</li>\n    <li><strong>If this answer choice does not work, cross it off.</strong> If you know the correct answer needs to be smaller or larger than the value you just tried, cross off any other incorrect answers.</li>\n    <li><strong>Pick one of the remaining answer choices and plug it back into the question.</strong> Repeat this until you find the correct answer. Remember, one of the 4 answer choices must work!</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>Example Problems</h3>\n\n  <h4>Example 1</h4>\n\n  <p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>\n  <p>If <span>√<span>(x + 10)</span></span> − 2<span>√<span>(x − 2)</span></span> = 0, what is the value of x?</p>\n  <p>A. 2<br>B. 6<br>C. 14<br>D. 18</p>\n\n  <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>\n  <p>The quickest and easiest way to solve this question is backsolving. Finding the correct answer is just a process of guess-and-check. Below, you can see how the correct answer B, when x = 6, makes the equation true.</p>\n\n    <span>√<span>(6 + 10)</span></span> − 2<span>√<span>(6 − 2)</span></span> = 0\n    <span>√<span>16</span></span> − 2<span>√<span>4</span></span> = 0\n    4 − 2(2) = 0\n    4 − 4 = 0\n    0 = 0 ✓\n\n  <p>Answer: B</p>\n\n  <h4>Example 2</h4>\n\n  <p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>\n  <p>Which of the following is a solution to the equation x³ + 5x² + 6x = 0?</p>\n  <p>A. -3<br>B. -1<br>C. 1<br>D. 2</p>\n\n  <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>\n  <p>Most students look at this question and think, \"Oh no, I need to factor this to solve.\" However, the easiest way to solve this question is backsolving! We plug the answer choices into the equation to see which one makes it equal 0.</p>\n\n    (−3)³ + 5(−3)² + 6(−3) = 0\n    −27 + 45 − 18 = 0\n    0 = 0 ✓\n\n  <p>Answer: A</p>\n\n  <h3>Backsolving With Points</h3>\n\n  <p>For questions with points in the question or answer choices, it is often effective to backsolve with points. For this method, we will use the point(s) to test which equation works correctly. Remember, if a point is on a graph, it must make the equation of the graph true.</p>\n\n  <h4>Example 3</h4>\n\n  <p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>\n  <p>A linear function f passes through the points (1, 5), (3, 9), and (7, 17). Which of the following equations defines f?</p>\n  <p>A. f(x) = 2x + 5<br>B. f(x) = x + 5<br>C. f(x) = 4x + 1<br>D. f(x) = 2x + 3</p>\n\n  <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>\n  <p>Here, the simplest way to solve is to test the answer choices using the points in the question. Let's start with the point (1, 5). When we plug in x = 1, we need to get f(1) = 5.</p>\n\n    <strong>Choice A:</strong> f(1) = 2(1) + 5 = 7 <span>✗</span>\n    <strong>Choice B:</strong> f(1) = 1 + 5 = 6 <span>✗</span>\n    <strong>Choice C:</strong> f(1) = 4(1) + 1 = 5 <span>✓</span>\n    <strong>Choice D:</strong> f(1) = 2(1) + 3 = 5 <span>✓</span>\n\n  <p>Answer choices A and B do not work, so we can eliminate those. Answer choices C and D both work, so we need to use a second point. Let's use the point (3, 9).</p>\n\n    <strong>Choice C:</strong> f(3) = 4(3) + 1 = 13 <span>✗</span>\n    <strong>Choice D:</strong> f(3) = 2(3) + 3 = 9 <span>✓</span>\n\n  <p>Answer: D</p>\n\n    <p> Key Takeaway</p>\n    <p>Backsolving is one of the most powerful test-taking strategies for the ACT Math section. Use it whenever you see answer choices that are numbers or when you get stuck on a question. It's often faster than solving algebraically!</p>\n</div>",

    "title": "Topic 1.2 - Number Substitution Technique",
    "content": "<div class=\"lesson-content\">\n<h2>Substitution</h2>\n\n  <p>In the first two lessons, you will learn two important test-taking techniques: backsolving and substitution. As you work through these lessons, use these techniques whenever you can to solve questions.</p>\n\n  <h3>What is Substitution?</h3>\n\n  <p>Do you prefer working with numbers or variables? We would guess your answer is numbers! On the ACT, some questions have many unknown variables and few or no numbers at all. Students often find these questions more difficult. If you prefer to work with numbers, let's work with numbers! With substitution, we substitute simple numbers in for variables and solve the question using numbers instead of relying on more complex algebra with variables.</p>\n\n  <h3>How to Use Substitution: 4 Steps</h3>\n\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      <strong>Pick a number for the variable(s) in the question.</strong>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Pick easy numbers...avoid using 0 and 1. Use 2, 3, 4 or other easy numbers. Use 10 for percent problems, 10 or 20 for group size, etc.</li>\n        <li>Select different numbers for each variable. For example, if a question has an <em>x</em> and a <em>y</em>, pick <em>x</em> = 2 and <em>y</em> = 3.</li>\n        <li>Follow any rules in the question. For example, if a question says <em>x</em> is a number that is negative and even, pick <em>x</em> = −2.</li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n\n    <li><strong>Write down the number(s) that you have picked.</strong></li>\n\n    <li><strong>Use your number(s) to work your way through the question and find your answer.</strong></li>\n\n    <li><strong>Plug your number(s) into the answer choices.</strong> The correct answer will be the one that matches your answer.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <p>Substitution may seem a bit confusing just reading the steps, so let's take a look at some example questions to see how useful this technique can be.</p>\n\n  <h3>Example Problems</h3>\n\n      <h4>Example 1</h4>\n      <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Jeremy has <em>n</em> boxes of candy bars. Each box contains <em>m</em> bars of candy. Jeremy has to sell 70% of his candy bars to make enough money for rent. Which of the following expresses the number of candy bars Jeremy must sell in terms of <em>m</em> and <em>n</em>?</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>A. 7(<em>m</em> + <em>n</em>)</li>\n        <li>B. 70<em>nm</em></li>\n        <li>C. <em>nm</em> + <em>m</em></li>\n        <li>D. 0.7<em>nm</em></li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>\n      <p>This question may at first seem intimidating with all the variables. To make this question easier, let's plug in numbers. We can say that Jeremy has 2 boxes of candy, so <em>n</em> = 2, and that each box contains 5 bars of candy, so <em>m</em> = 5. With our numbers, Jeremy has a total of 10 candy bars. He needs to sell 70% to make enough money for rent, so we can find the total candy bars that he must sell by finding 70% of 10.</p>\n      \n        <p>0.7(10) = 7</p>\n      \n      <p>With our numbers, Jeremy must sell 7 candy bars, so our answer is 7. Now, we can plug in the values we selected for <em>n</em> and <em>m</em> into the answer choices and see which one is equal to 7. Here, we find that D works:</p>\n      \n        <p>0.7<em>nm</em> = 0.7(2)(5) = 7 ✓</p>\n      \n      <p><strong>Answer: D</strong></p>\n      <p>None of the other answer choices are equal to 7 when we plug in our values for <em>n</em> and <em>m</em>. No matter what numbers you pick for <em>n</em> and <em>m</em>, you will find that D is the answer.</p>\n\n      <h4>Example 2</h4>\n      <p><strong>Problem:</strong> If cos(2<em>x</em>°) = <em>a</em>, which of the following equations is also true for all values of <em>x</em>?</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>A. sin(2<em>x</em>°) = <em>a</em></li>\n        <li>B. sin(<em>x</em>° + 90°) = <em>a</em></li>\n        <li>C. cos(90° − 2<em>x</em>°) = <em>a</em></li>\n        <li>D. sin(90° − 2<em>x</em>°) = <em>a</em></li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>\n      <p>The easiest way to solve this question is to pick a value for <em>x</em> and use your calculator. Let's pick <em>x</em> = 10°. First, we need to find out what <em>a</em> equals if <em>x</em> = 10°.</p>\n      \n        <p>cos(2<em>x</em>°) = <em>a</em></p>\n        <p>cos(20°) = <em>a</em></p>\n        <p><em>a</em> = 0.9397</p>\n      \n      <p>Now that we know what <em>a</em> equals, we can plug in <em>x</em> = 10° for the <em>x</em>-values in the answer choices to see which is equal to 0.9397. Here, we can see how the correct answer choice of D works:</p>\n      \n        <p>sin(90° − 2<em>x</em>°) = <em>a</em></p>\n        <p>sin(90° − 20°) = sin(70°)</p>\n        <p>sin(70°) = 0.9397 ✓</p>\n      \n      <p><strong>Answer: D</strong></p>\n      <p>This trick will work for any value of <em>x</em> that we pick. Note that since we are solving in degrees, your calculator must be in degree mode. If you get a value other than cos(20°) = 0.9397 when you input cos(20) in your calculator, your calculator is in radian mode.</p>\n\n      <h4>Example 3</h4>\n      <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The length of a rectangle is tripled and the width of the rectangle is halved to create a new rectangle. How many times as large is the area of the new rectangle than the area of the original rectangle?</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>A. 1.5</li>\n        <li>B. 2</li>\n        <li>C. 3</li>\n        <li>D. 4</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>\n      <p>To make this question easier, we can pick values for the length and width of the rectangle. Let's make the length 3 and the width 2. Now, we just follow the steps in the question.</p>\n      \n        <p><strong>Original rectangle:</strong></p>\n        <p>Length = 3, Width = 2</p>\n        <p>Area = 3 × 2 = 6</p>\n        <p><strong>New rectangle:</strong></p>\n        <p>The length is tripled: 3(3) = 9</p>\n        <p>The width is halved: 2(½) = 1</p>\n        <p>Area = 9 × 1 = 9</p>\n      \n      <p>Next, we find the areas of the rectangles and compare. The new rectangle has an area of 9. The original rectangle has an area of 6, so we find that the new rectangle is 1.5 times as large (9 ÷ 6 = 1.5).</p>\n      <p><strong>Answer: A</strong></p>\n\n    <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>\n    <p>Substitution is a powerful technique when you encounter questions with many variables and few numbers. By picking simple numbers and testing the answer choices, you can turn abstract algebraic problems into concrete arithmetic that's much easier to solve!</p>\n</div>",

    "title": "Topic 2.1 - Understanding Angles & Lines",
    "content": "<div class=\"lesson-content\">\n<p>Angles are everywhere in geometry! In this lesson, you'll learn how angles work when lines intersect and cross. We'll start with the basics and build up to more complex situations. By the end, you'll be able to find any angle in a diagram!</p>\n\n  <h3>What is an Angle?</h3>\n  \n  <p>An angle is formed when two lines or rays meet at a point. We measure angles in degrees (°). Here are the basic types:</p>\n\n      <h4>Acute Angle</h4>\n      \n      <p>Less than 90°</p>\n\n      <h4>Right Angle</h4>\n      \n      <p>Exactly 90°</p>\n\n      <h4>Obtuse Angle</h4>\n      \n      <p>Greater than 90°</p>\n\n      <h4>Straight Angle</h4>\n      \n      <p>Exactly 180°</p>\n\n  <h3>When Two Lines Intersect</h3>\n\n  <p>When two straight lines cross each other, they create 4 angles at the intersection point. Let's explore what we know about these angles:</p>\n\n        <p><strong> Vertical Angles are Equal</strong></p>\n        <p>Angles across from each other are always equal. So the two blue angles (a°) are equal, and the two red angles (b°) are equal.</p>\n\n        <p><strong> Adjacent Angles Add to 180°</strong></p>\n        <p>Angles next to each other add up to 180°. So a° + b° = 180°.</p>\n\n    <h4> Try It Yourself!</h4>\n    <p>If one angle is 70°, what are the other three angles?</p>\n    \n      <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The vertical angle is also 70° (vertical angles are equal)</p>\n      <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The adjacent angle is 180° − 70° = 110° (adjacent angles add to 180°)</p>\n      <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The other adjacent angle is also 110° (vertical to the first one)</p>\n      <p>Answer: 70°, 110°, 70°, 110°</p>\n\n  <h3>Parallel Lines Cut by a Transversal</h3>\n\n  <p>This is the most important angle concept on the ACT! When two parallel lines are crossed by another line (called a transversal), special angle relationships are created. Here's the simple way to remember it:</p>\n\n    <h4> The Big Secret: Only TWO Different Angles!</h4>\n    <p>All 8 angles are either <span>acute</span> or <span>obtuse</span>. That's it!</p>\n\n  <img src=\"/images/parallel-lines-simple.svg\" alt=\"Parallel lines with transversal\">\n\n  <p>When a transversal crosses two parallel lines, it creates 8 angles. But here's the amazing part: these 8 angles form only TWO groups of equal angles!</p>\n\n  <img src=\"/images/parallel-lines-set1.svg\" alt=\"Set 1: Acute angles\">\n\n    <p>Set 1: The Four Acute Angles</p>\n    <p>These four angles are all EQUAL. If you know one is 60°, then all four are 60°!</p>\n\n  <img src=\"/images/parallel-lines-set2.svg\" alt=\"Set 2: Obtuse angles\">\n\n    <p>Set 2: The Four Obtuse Angles</p>\n    <p>These four angles are all EQUAL. If you know one is 120°, then all four are 120°!</p>\n\n    <h4> The Key Relationship</h4>\n    <p>Any angle from Set 1 + Any angle from Set 2 = 180°</p>\n    <p>So if Set 1 angles are 60°, then Set 2 angles must be 120° (because 60° + 120° = 180°)</p>\n\n  <h3>Practice Problem</h3>\n\n    <h4>Example: Finding All Angles</h4>\n\n      <p>Problem:</p>\n      <p>In the diagram below, lines L₁ and L₂ are parallel. If angle 1 measures 65°, what is the measure of angle 6?</p>\n\n      <p>Solution (Step-by-Step):</p>\n      <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Angle 1 is 65°, so it's an acute angle. This means angle 1 is in \"Set 1\" (the acute angles).</p>\n      <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> All four angles in Set 1 are equal, so angles 1, 4, 5, and 8 are all 65°.</p>\n      <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Angle 6 is in \"Set 2\" (the obtuse angles). We know Set 1 + Set 2 = 180°.</p>\n      <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> So angle 6 = 180° − 65° = 115°</p>\n      <p>Answer: 115°</p>\n\n    <p> Master Strategy for Parallel Lines</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li>Find ONE angle (usually given in the problem)</li>\n      <li>Decide if it's acute or obtuse</li>\n      <li>All angles in that group are EQUAL to it</li>\n      <li>All angles in the other group are 180° minus that angle</li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>That's all you need! No fancy terminology like \"alternate interior\" or \"corresponding\" – just two sets of equal angles!</p>\n</div>",

  "fractions": {
    "title": "Fractions",
    "content": "<div class=\"lesson-content\">\n<p class=\"lesson-intro\">Fractions appear frequently on the ACT, and knowing how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide them efficiently is essential. Your calculator can help, but understanding the concepts will make you faster and more accurate. Let's learn fractions from the ground up!</p>\n\n<h3>What is a Fraction?</h3>\n\n<p>A fraction represents a part of a whole. It has two components: the <strong>numerator</strong> (top number) and the <strong>denominator</strong> (bottom number). Think of a fraction like 3/4 as \"3 out of 4 parts.\" The numerator tells you how many parts you have, while the denominator tells you the total number of equal parts that make up the whole.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if you cut a pizza into 4 equal slices and eat 3 of them, you've eaten 3/4 of the pizza. The 3 is the numerator (slices you ate) and the 4 is the denominator (total slices).</p>\n\n<h3>Fraction Operations</h3>\n\n<h4>Multiplication</h4>\n\n<p>Multiplying fractions is the easiest operation! Just multiply straight across: multiply the numerators together, then multiply the denominators together. The formula is: a/b × c/d = (a × c)/(b × d)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> 2/3 × 4/5 = (2 × 4)/(3 × 5) = 8/15</p>\n\n<h4>Division</h4>\n\n<p>Dividing fractions uses a simple trick: flip the second fraction (take its reciprocal) and then multiply! Remember: \"Keep, Change, Flip\" - keep the first fraction the same, change division to multiplication, and flip the second fraction. The formula is: a/b ÷ c/d = a/b × d/c</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> 2/3 ÷ 4/5 = 2/3 × 5/4 = 10/12 = 5/6 (simplified)</p>\n\n<h4>Addition and Subtraction</h4>\n\n<p>Adding and subtracting fractions requires a common denominator - the bottoms must match! You can't add fractions with different denominators directly. First, find a common denominator (usually the least common multiple of the two denominators), convert both fractions, then add or subtract the numerators.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> 1/4 + 2/3 = 3/12 + 8/12 = 11/12</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-Step: Adding Fractions</h3>\n\n<p>Let's walk through adding 1/4 + 2/3 together step by step.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1: Find a common denominator.</strong> We need a number that both 4 and 3 divide into evenly. The smallest common multiple is 12, since 4 × 3 = 12 and 3 × 4 = 12.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2: Convert both fractions.</strong> To convert 1/4 to twelfths, multiply both the top and bottom by 3: 1/4 = 3/12. To convert 2/3 to twelfths, multiply both the top and bottom by 4: 2/3 = 8/12.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3: Add the numerators.</strong> Now that both fractions have the same denominator, we can add: 3/12 + 8/12 = 11/12. The denominator stays the same!</p>\n\n<h3>Calculator Tip</h3>\n\n<p>Here's a time-saving trick for the ACT: you can convert fractions to decimals on your calculator! For a problem like 3/7 + 2/5, just type (3÷7) + (2÷5) and hit equals. You'll get a decimal answer that you can match to the answer choices. This is especially helpful when the fractions are complicated or when you're running short on time.</p>\n\n<h3>Example Problem</h3>\n\n<h4>Example 1</h4>\n\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> What is 5/8 × 4/15?</p>\n\n<p>A. 1/6<br>B. 1/3<br>C. 2/3<br>D. 9/23</p>\n\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Multiply the numerators together and the denominators together, then simplify.</p>\n\n<p>5/8 × 4/15 = (5 × 4)/(8 × 15) = 20/120</p>\n\n<p>Now simplify by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 20:</p>\n\n<p>20/120 = 1/6</p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer: A</strong></p>\n\n<h3>Key Takeaway</h3>\n\n<p>Remember the tricks: multiply straight across, divide by flipping the second fraction, and use common denominators for addition/subtraction. Your calculator is your friend—use it to convert fractions to decimals when you need to save time! With practice, these operations will become second nature.</p>\n\n</div>",

Once you understand the pattern, you can find centers, radii, and sketch these curves easily. Let's build your understanding from the ground up!</p>\n\n  <h3>Circle Basics</h3>\n\n  <p>A circle is all points that are the same distance (radius) from a center point. On the coordinate plane, we can write this as an equation!</p>\n\n    <h4>Standard Circle Equation</h4>\n    \n      <p>(x − h)² + (y − k)² = r²</p>\n\n        <p>(h, k)</p>\n        <p>Center</p>\n\n        <p>r</p>\n        <p>Radius</p>\n\n        <p>r²</p>\n        <p>Radius squared</p>\n\n  <h3>Visualizing a Circle</h3>\n\n    <h4>Circle: (x − 2)² + (y − 1)² = 16</h4>\n\n      <p><strong>Center:</strong> (h, k) = (2, 1)</p>\n      <p><strong>Radius squared:</strong> r² = 16</p>\n      <p><strong>Radius:</strong> r = √16 = 4</p>\n\n    <p><strong> Watch the Signs!</strong> The equation is (x − h)² + (y − k)². If you see (x − 2)², the center x-coordinate is <strong>+2</strong>, not −2. If you see (x + 3)², write it as (x − (−3))², so h = −3.</p>\n\n  <h3>Ellipses</h3>\n\n  <p>An ellipse is like a stretched circle. It has two radii: one horizontal (a) and one vertical (b).</p>\n\n    <h4>Standard Ellipse Equation</h4>\n    \n      <p>(x − h)² / a² + (y − k)² / b² = 1</p>\n\n        <p>(h, k)</p>\n        <p>Center</p>\n\n        <p>a</p>\n        <p>Horizontal radius</p>\n\n        <p>b</p>\n        <p>Vertical radius</p>\n\n  <h3>Visualizing an Ellipse</h3>\n\n    <h4>Ellipse: (x − 1)² / 9 + (y − 2)² / 4 = 1</h4>\n\n      <p><strong>Center:</strong> (h, k) = (1, 2)</p>\n      <p><strong>Horizontal radius:</strong> a² = 9 → a = 3</p>\n      <p><strong>Vertical radius:</strong> b² = 4 → b = 2</p>\n\n  <h3>Example Problem</h3>\n\n  <h4>Example 1</h4>\n\n  <p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>\n  <p>What is the center of the circle (x + 3)² + (y − 5)² = 25?</p>\n  <p>A.

(−3, −5)</p>\n\n  <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>\n  <p>Rewrite (x + 3)² as (x − (−3))² to match the standard form (x − h)² + (y − k)² = r²</p>\n\n    (x + 3)² + (y − 5)² = 25\n    (x − (−3))² + (y − 5)² = 25\n    h = −3, k = 5\n    Center: (−3, 5)\n\n  <p>Answer: B</p>\n\n    <p> Key Takeaway</p>\n    <p>The signs in the equation are opposite of the center coordinates! (x − h) means the center x-value is +h. (x + 3) means (x − (−3)), so h = −3. Always rewrite to match the standard form!</p>\n</div>",
