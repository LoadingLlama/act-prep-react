The ACT consists of four required sections—English, Math, Reading, and Science—plus an optional Writing section. This lesson will give you a complete overview of the test format, teach you how scores work, and provide strategic insights to help you maximize your performance on test day. </p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 1. Test Structure and Format </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The ACT is a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">standardized test</strong> used by colleges for admissions decisions. Unlike the SAT, the ACT tests more straightforward knowledge and has a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Science section</strong>. The test is divided into four required sections and one optional section, with a total testing time of about 3 hours (or 3.5 hours with Writing). </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> English Section: 45 Minutes, 75 Questions </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">English section</strong> tests grammar, punctuation, sentence structure, and rhetorical skills across five passages. You'll have approximately 45 seconds per question. Questions test conventions of standard English (grammar and usage), production of writing (strategy and organization), and knowledge of language (style and tone). This section appears first on the test, so starting strong is crucial for building confidence. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Math Section: 60 Minutes, 60 Questions </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Math section</strong> covers pre-algebra, elementary algebra, intermediate algebra, coordinate geometry, plane geometry, and trigonometry. You have one minute per question on average. A <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">reference sheet</strong> with basic formulas is provided, but memorizing key formulas will save time. Calculators are permitted (and highly recommended) for this entire section. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Reading Section: 35 Minutes, 40 Questions </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Reading section</strong> includes four passages: Prose Fiction/Literary Narrative, Social Science, Humanities, and Natural Science. Each passage has 10 questions. You'll have about 8 minutes and 45 seconds per passage, so time management is critical. Questions test your ability to determine main ideas, locate details, understand sequences, make comparisons, comprehend cause-effect relationships, determine word meaning, and analyze author's voice and method. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Science Section: 35 Minutes, 40 Questions </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Science section</strong> tests interpretation, analysis, evaluation, reasoning, and problem-solving skills through data representation, research summaries, and conflicting viewpoints passages. Don't worry—you don't need advanced science knowledge! The section primarily tests your ability to read graphs, charts, and tables, and apply scientific reasoning. Most students find this section challenging due to the pace (about 53 seconds per question). </p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 2. Scoring System and What Scores Mean </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Understanding how the ACT is scored helps you set realistic goals and track your progress. The ACT uses a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">scaled scoring system</strong> from 1-36, and there's <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">no penalty for wrong answers</strong>, so you should always guess if you're running out of time. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> How Scores Are Calculated </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Each section (English, Math, Reading, Science) receives a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">scaled score</strong> from 1-36 based on the number of questions you answer correctly (your <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">raw score</strong>). These four section scores are then averaged to create your <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Composite Score</strong>, which is the most important number for college admissions. The composite is rounded to the nearest whole number—for example, if your four section scores are 28, 30, 26, and 32, your composite is (28+30+26+32)/4 = 29. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> What's a Good Score? </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The national average composite score is around <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">20-21</strong>. A score of 24 puts you in approximately the 75th percentile, meaning you scored higher than 75% of test-takers. Competitive colleges typically want scores above 27, while highly selective schools (Ivy League, top liberal arts colleges) generally expect 32-36. However, "good" depends on your target schools—research the average ACT scores for admitted students at colleges you're interested in. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Subscores and STEM Score </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> In addition to section scores, you'll receive <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">subscores</strong> (1-18 scale) for specific skill areas like "Production of Writing" in English or "Integrating Essential Skills" in Math. You'll also see a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">STEM score</strong>, which averages your Math and Science scores. While colleges primarily focus on your composite and individual section scores, subscores can help identify specific areas for improvement. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Superscoring </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Many colleges practice <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">superscoring</strong>, which means they take your highest section scores across multiple test dates and recalculate a new composite. For example, if you score English 28, Math 30, Reading 25, Science 27 on Test 1, then English 26, Math 32, Reading 28, Science 26 on Test 2, your superscore would combine the best from each: 28, 32, 28, 27 = composite 28.75, rounded to 29. Check whether your target colleges superscore—this policy encourages retaking the ACT to improve individual sections. </p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 3. General Test-Taking Strategies </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Success on the ACT requires more than content knowledge—you need effective <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">time management</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">strategic guessing</strong>, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">stress management</strong> skills. These universal strategies apply across all four sections. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Always Answer Every Question </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The ACT has <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">no guessing penalty</strong>—wrong answers don't count against you. This means you should NEVER leave a question blank. If you're running out of time, quickly bubble in an answer for every remaining question. Statistically, random guessing gives you about a 20-25% chance of being correct, which is better than 0%! </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Pace Yourself and Use a Watch </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Time pressure is one of the ACT's biggest challenges. Wear a <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">watch</strong> (analog watches are best since digital devices aren't allowed) and set checkpoints. For example, in Reading, you should finish passage 1 by minute 8, passage 2 by minute 17, passage 3 by minute 26, and passage 4 by minute 35. Don't spend too long on any single question—if you're stuck after 30-45 seconds, make your best guess, circle it in the test booklet, and move on. You can return if time permits. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Answer Easy Questions First </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Not all questions are created equal. Some are straightforward, while others require complex reasoning. Within each section, scan for <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">"quick points"</strong>—questions you can answer confidently in 20-30 seconds. Rack up these easy points first, then tackle harder questions with your remaining time. This strategy maximizes your score even if time runs out. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Process of Elimination </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> When you're unsure of the correct answer, use <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">process of elimination</strong>. Cross out answers you know are wrong in your test booklet, then guess among remaining choices. Eliminating even one wrong answer improves your odds from 20% to 25% (for 4-choice questions) or 25% to 33% (for 3-choice questions). Often you can <span class="glossary-term" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; cursor: help;" title="Cross out wrong answer choices">eliminate</span> 2-3 choices, giving you a strong chance of guessing correctly. </p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 4. Test Day Preparation and Logistics </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Your performance on test day depends not only on preparation but also on practical considerations like what to bring, how to manage stress, and what to expect at the testing center. Being well-prepared logistically helps you focus entirely on the test itself. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> What to Bring </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Mandatory items: your <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">admission ticket</strong> (printed from your ACT account) and an acceptable <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">photo ID</strong> (school ID, driver's license, or passport). Recommended items: several sharpened No. 2 pencils with erasers, an approved <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">calculator</strong> with fresh batteries, a watch (not a smartwatch), snacks and water for breaks, and layered clothing in case the room is too hot or cold. Do NOT bring: cell phones, smartwatches, prohibited calculators, reference materials, or scratch paper (you can use the test booklet). </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Night Before and Morning Of </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The night before: review a few key formulas or grammar rules, but don't cram—it's more important to get <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">8 hours of sleep</strong>. Pack your backpack with everything you'll need. Set multiple alarms. The morning of: eat a substantial, protein-rich breakfast (avoid sugary foods that cause energy crashes). Arrive at the test center by 7:45 AM for an 8:00 AM start—latecomers aren't admitted. Use the bathroom before testing begins, as breaks are limited. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Managing Test Anxiety </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Feeling nervous is normal, but excessive <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">test anxiety</strong> can hurt your performance. Practice <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">deep breathing</strong> techniques: inhale slowly for 4 counts, hold for 4 counts, exhale for 4 counts. During the test, if you feel overwhelmed, close your eyes for 10 seconds, take a deep breath, and refocus. Remember: you can retake the ACT—this one test doesn't define you. Confidence comes from preparation, so thorough practice with realistic timed tests is your best defense against anxiety. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> After the Test </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Scores are typically released 2-8 weeks after your test date (check your ACT account for the exact release date). You can send your scores to colleges for free on test day (list up to 4 schools), or pay later to send additional score reports. Many students take the ACT 2-3 times to improve their composite score—each attempt gives you new experience and insights. Review your score report carefully to identify weak areas, then create a targeted study plan for your next attempt. </p> <p style="height: 1px; margin: 0; padding: 0;"></p><h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700; visibility: hidden; height: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0; overflow: hidden;">.</h3><h3 style="color: #2e7d32; font-size: 1.4rem; font-weight: 700; margin: 3rem 0 1.5rem 0;"> Key Takeaways </h3> <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>The ACT has four sections: English (45 min, 75 Q), Math (60 min, 60 Q), Reading (35 min, 40 Q), Science (35 min, 40 Q)</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Scores range from 1-36 per section; your Composite is the average of all four sections</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>There's no guessing penalty—ALWAYS answer every question, even if you have to guess</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Time management is crucial: use a watch, set checkpoints, and don't spend too long on any question</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Many colleges superscore—taking the ACT multiple times can improve your composite</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;"><span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Test day essentials: admission ticket, photo ID, No. 2 pencils, approved calculator, watch</li> </ul></body></html>
