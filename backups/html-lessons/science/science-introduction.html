<html><head></head><body><p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The ACT Science section tests your ability to analyze scientific data, interpret graphs and tables, understand experimental design, evaluate competing hypotheses, and draw evidence-based conclusions. Unlike traditional science tests that assess memorized content knowledge, the ACT Science section primarily measures your scientific reasoning and data interpretation skills.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">With only 35 minutes to answer 40 questions across 6-7 passages, you must work quickly and efficiently while maintaining accuracy. This lesson introduces the fundamental structure of the Science section, explains what skills are actually being tested, and provides a roadmap for approaching this challenging but highly manageable section of the ACT.</p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 1. Understanding the Science Section Format </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The ACT Science section is the fourth and final section of the test, consisting of 6-7 passages with 40 total questions. You have exactly 35 minutes to complete all questions, which translates to approximately 5 minutes per passage.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Understanding the structure, passage types, and time constraints is essential for developing an effective strategy that maximizes your score.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Section Timing and Passage Distribution </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">40 questions:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">. The number of questions per passage varies depending on the passage type</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">most passages have 5-6 questions, but the Conflicting Viewpoints passage typically has 7 questions. This means you have approximately 52.5 seconds per question, but in practice, you need to account for the time required to read and understand passages, study figures</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">analyze data. The strict time limit makes the Science section one of the most time-pressured parts of the ACT. Many students report that their biggest challenge is finishing all passages within the allotted time, which is why developing efficient reading and data analysis strategies is crucial.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> The Three Passage Types </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Data Representation:</strong> (2-3 passages with 5 questions each)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Research Summaries:</strong> (3-4 passages with 6 questions each), and</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Conflicting Viewpoints:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">(1 passage with 7 questions). Data Representation passages present scientific information through graphs</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">and diagrams with minimal text</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">testing your ability to extract and analyze data. Research Summaries passages describe one or more experiments</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">testing your understanding of experimental design</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">results. Conflicting Viewpoints passages present two or more scientists or students discussing different hypotheses or theories about the same phenomenon, testing your ability to compare and contrast scientific perspectives. Recognizing these passage types immediately helps you adjust your reading strategy and know what to expect.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Content Areas Covered </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Earth/space sciences:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">. Topics might include genetics, ecology, chemical reactions, atomic structure, motion and forces, electricity, geology, meteorology, astronomy, and more. However, the ACT does not expect you to have memorized extensive science content</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">nearly all information needed to answer questions is provided in the passage itself. The section primarily tests your ability to interpret data, understand experimental methods</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">apply basic scientific reasoning rather than recall specific facts. That said, having a general familiarity with basic science concepts (like understanding what pH measures, knowing that temperature affects reaction rates, or recognizing common scientific units) can help you work more efficiently.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Scoring and Performance Expectations </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">raw score:</strong> (0-40), which is then converted to a</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">scaled score: from 1-36. The conversion table varies slightly from test to test to account for difficulty differences</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">generally, missing 2-3 questions can still yield a score in the 33-35 range, while missing 6-8 questions typically results in a score around 28-30. There is</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">no penalty for wrong answers: so you should always guess if you're running out of time. The Science section is often considered one of the most improvable sections of the ACT because success depends more on test-taking strategies and data interpretation skills than on extensive content knowledge</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Students who initially struggle with timing often see significant score improvements after learning efficient passage navigation techniques and question-answering strategies.</li></ul> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Example: Section Breakdown Typical Science section structure: - Data Representation passages: 2-3 passages × 5 questions = 10-15 questions - Research Summaries passages: 3-4 passages × 6 questions = 18-24 questions - Conflicting Viewpoints passage: 1 passage × 7 questions = 7 questions Total: 6-7 passages with 40 questions in 35 minutes. Recommended pacing: 5 minutes per passage, with flexibility to spend more time on complex passages and less on straightforward ones.</p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 2. What the Science Section Actually Tests </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Despite its name, the ACT Science section is better understood as a scientific reasoning test rather than a traditional science knowledge test. The section assesses three main skill categories: Interpretation of Data, Scientific Investigation, and Evaluation of Models, Inferences, and Experimental Results.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Understanding these skill categories helps you recognize what each question is asking and how to approach it strategically.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Interpretation of Data (40-50% of questions) </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Interpretation of Data questions test your ability to read graphs and tables, identify trends, extract specific values, and interpolate or extrapolate data. You might be asked to determine what temperature corresponds to a specific pressure value from a graph, identify whether two variables have a positive or inverse relationship, or predict what would happen if an experiment continued beyond the data shown.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">These questions require careful attention to axis labels, units, scales, and legends. Common question stems include:.</p><ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">"According to Figure 1, what was the pH when temperature was 40°C?", "Based on Table 2, as concentration increased</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">reaction rate:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">or "If the experiment had continued</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">the mass at 60 seconds would most likely have been:"</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Success on these questions comes from methodically reading data representations and avoiding careless errors like misreading scales or confusing which variable is which</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Scientific Investigation (20-30% of questions) </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Scientific Investigation:</strong> questions test your understanding of</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">scientific methodology:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">. You need to identify which variables were manipulated (independent variables)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">which were measured (dependent variables)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">which were held constant (control variables)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">and what the purpose of specific experimental procedures was. Questions might ask: "Which variable was directly manipulated by the researchers?"</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">"What was the purpose of Trial 1?", "Which of the following would be the best way to extend this experiment?", or "What hypothesis was being tested in Experiment 2?" These questions assess whether you understand how scientific experiments are structured and how scientists test hypotheses systematically. Strong performance requires understanding the logic behind experimental design and recognizing the difference between correlation and causation.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Evaluation of Models, Inferences, and Experimental Results (30-40% of questions) </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Evaluation:</strong> questions test your ability to</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">evaluate whether evidence supports a hypothesis:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">. These questions require higher-order thinking and often involve synthesizing information from multiple sources within a passage. You might be asked: "Based on the results of Experiments 1 and 2</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">which conclusion is best supported?"</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">"Which hypothesis is consistent with the data in Table 3?"</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">"Student 1 would most likely agree with which statement?"</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">or "What additional information would help determine which theory is correct?" These questions are typically more challenging because they require you to go beyond simply reading data and instead think critically about what the data means, what assumptions underlie different viewpoints, and what logical conclusions can be drawn. Success requires careful reasoning and avoiding common pitfalls like choosing answers that sound plausible but aren't actually supported by the passage.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> The Minimal Role of Outside Knowledge </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">One of the most important things to understand about the ACT Science section is that it requires minimal outside content knowledge.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">The vast majority of questions can be answered using only the information provided in the passage, figures, and tables. You might encounter 1-3 questions per test that require basic scientific knowledge (such as knowing that water boils at 100°C at standard pressure, understanding that photosynthesis produces oxygen, or recognizing common lab equipment), but these represent a very small percentage of total questions.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">In fact, trying to apply outside knowledge can sometimes lead you astray if you make assumptions that contradict the passage's specific setup.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">The best approach is to trust the passage and base your answers on what is explicitly stated or clearly implied by the data.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Students with limited science coursework can still achieve excellent scores by focusing on data interpretation and reasoning skills rather than worrying about content gaps..</li></ul> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Example: Skill Category Breakdown In a typical 40-question Science section: - 16-20 questions test Interpretation of Data (reading graphs, identifying trends, extracting values) - 8-12 questions test Scientific Investigation (experimental design, variables, controls) - 12-16 questions test Evaluation (drawing conclusions, analyzing viewpoints, making inferences) Knowing this distribution helps you understand where to focus your practice and what skills matter most for a high score. The majority of questions test data interpretation and evaluation skills rather than memorized science facts.</p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 3. Common Misconceptions About the Science Section </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Many students approach the Science section with incorrect assumptions that hinder their performance. Understanding and correcting these misconceptions is crucial for developing an effective strategy and avoiding common pitfalls that prevent students from reaching their scoring potential.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Misconception #1: You Need Extensive Science Knowledge </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">scientific reasoning and data interpretation skills:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">not memorized content. Students who have taken Advanced Placement science courses don't necessarily score higher than students with basic science coursework if they haven't developed strong graph-reading and analytical skills. The passage provides all necessary context</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">definitions</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">and background information. Your job is to</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">apply logical reasoning:</strong> not recall obscure scientific facts. In fact, overthinking questions by trying to apply outside knowledge often leads students to incorrect answers when they should simply trust what the passage explicitly states. Focus on developing strong data analysis skills rather than cramming science content.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Misconception #2: You Must Read Every Word of Text </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">strategic skimming approach:</strong> quickly reading the introduction to understand the general topic, focusing primarily on</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">figures and tables: and only reading detailed text when needed to answer specific questions. The figures often contain the most important information</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">paragraphs of text frequently just explain procedures in more detail than necessary. Learning to</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">prioritize visual data:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">over lengthy descriptions can save significant time. However, this doesn't mean ignoring text entirely</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">you need to read enough to understand what was studied and what the variables represent, but you don't need to memorize every procedural detail</li></ul></li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Misconception #3: Harder Science Topics Mean Harder Questions </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Students often feel intimidated when they see passages about unfamiliar or complex-sounding topics like "polymerase chain reaction" or "superconductivity." However, passage topic complexity does not correlate with question difficulty. A passage about a sophisticated physics concept might have straightforward questions that simply ask you to read values from a graph, while a passage about a simple experiment with plants might have challenging questions that require synthesizing information from multiple trials.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The ACT deliberately uses technical-sounding topics to test whether you can stay focused and confident when faced with unfamiliar material. Don't let intimidating vocabulary or advanced-sounding topics psyche you out.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The questions are designed to be answerable regardless of your prior knowledge of the specific topic. Stay calm, focus on the data, and trust that all necessary information is provided.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Misconception #4: The Passages Must Be Completed in Order </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Many students assume they must work through Science passages in the order they appear, but this is not a requirement. In fact, strategic passage selection can improve both your score and confidence.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Some students find Data Representation passages faster and easier because they focus primarily on graphs with minimal text, so they tackle those first to bank time for more complex passages. Others prefer starting with Research Summaries because they find the experimental format more intuitive.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Still others save the Conflicting Viewpoints passage for last because it has the most text and different question types. You can also preview passages quickly and identify which ones look most straightforward based on figure complexity and text length.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Experiment during practice to find an order that maximizes your efficiency. Just be careful to bubble answers in the correct spots on your answer sheet when you skip around.</p> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Example: Correcting Misconceptions in Practice Before: "I need to read every word carefully and I'm worried because I haven't taken AP Chemistry yet." After: "I'll focus primarily on the figures and tables, skim the text for context, and trust that all information I need is in the passage. My score depends on data interpretation skills, not memorized content." This mindset shift alone can lead to significant time savings and reduced anxiety, allowing you to work more efficiently and confidently through Science passages.</p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 4. Building Your Science Section Foundation </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Success on the ACT Science section requires developing a systematic approach that combines efficient passage navigation, strong data interpretation skills, strategic time management, and focused practice. This section introduces foundational concepts and habits that will support your improvement across all Science question types.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Developing a Passage Attack Strategy </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">quickly reading the introduction to understand what phenomenon or question is being studied</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">examining all figures and tables to understand what variables are being measured and what trends are visible</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">skimming any experimental descriptions to identify how trials differ from each other, and</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">moving to the questions, referring back to specific parts of the passage as needed.</li></ul>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">This approach prioritizes the most important information (the data itself) while avoiding getting bogged down in procedural details. However, you should experiment with variations during practice to find what works best for your reading style and strengths.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Some students prefer reading questions first to know what to look for, while others find this disruptive. Find your optimal approach through deliberate practice.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Mastering Figure and Table Analysis </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">graphs, tables, and diagrams:</strong> developing strong figure-reading skills is essential. When you look at any figure, immediately identify: (1) what</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">variables:</strong> are being shown (check axis labels and table headers), (2) what</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">units:</strong> are being used (meters, seconds, grams, etc.), (3) what</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">scale:</strong> is being used (does the axis start at zero or some other value?), (4) what</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">relationships or trends:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">are visible (do values increase</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">or stay constant?)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">and (5) what different</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">lines or symbols: represent (check the legend). Practice reading figures actively by asking yourself these questions for every graph or table you encounter</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Also train yourself to spot common pitfalls like logarithmic scales, multiple y-axes, or unusual units that could cause misinterpretation.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Understanding Variables and Experimental Design Basics </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">independent variables:</strong> (what the researcher changes)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">dependent variables:</strong> (what the researcher measures), and</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">control variables:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">(what the researcher keeps the same). For example</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">if an experiment tests how different fertilizers affect plant growth</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">the fertilizer type is the independent variable</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">plant height is the dependent variable</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">factors like water amount, sunlight, and temperature should be control variables. You should also understand why scientists run</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">control groups:<ul style="margin: 0.15rem 0 0.15rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">(to provide a baseline for comparison)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">why they repeat trials multiple times (to ensure results are reliable and not due to chance)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">and how to distinguish between</li></ul></li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">correlation and causation:</strong> . These fundamental concepts appear repeatedly across Science passages.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Time Management and Practice Strategies </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Improving your Science score requires deliberate practice with a focus on both accuracy and speed</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Start by working on individual passages untimed to ensure you understand how to analyze data and answer questions correctly.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Once your accuracy is consistently high (80%+ correct), begin adding time pressure by setting a 5-minute timer per passage</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Track which passage types and question types give you the most trouble, and dedicate extra practice to those areas.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">When reviewing practice questions, don't just check whether you got them right or wrong—carefully review the reasoning behind each answer</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">figure out why wrong answers are incorrect, and identify what clues in the passage you should have noticed.</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Also practice on full-length Science sections to build stamina and ensure your strategy works under realistic testing conditions</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Many students find that their Science score improves more rapidly than other sections once they understand the underlying skills being tested and develop efficient strategies..</li></ul> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Example: Building Your Science Practice Plan Week 1-2: Master individual passage types untimed. Focus on Data Representation passages first (simplest), then Research Summaries, then Conflicting Viewpoints.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Week 3-4: Practice full Science sections with timing (35 minutes). Identify your weak passage types and question types.</p>
