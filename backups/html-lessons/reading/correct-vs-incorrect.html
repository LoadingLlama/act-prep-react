Understanding what makes an answer choice correct or incorrect is one of the most important skills for Reading success. Many students feel like they're looking for the "best" answer, but this is wrong—there is always 1 correct and 3 incorrect answer choices, and the challenge is knowing what makes the correct answer right and the incorrect answers wrong.

1. The 5 Common Types of Incorrect Answer Choices
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For success on the Reading Test, you must be able to explain what makes an answer choice incorrect
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">For an answer choice to be correct, it must be supported by evidence in the passage AND answer the question being asked</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If you understand not only what makes an answer correct but also what makes the others incorrect, finding the right answer becomes much easier</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The 5 most common types of incorrect answers on the ACT Reading Test are: Not in the Passage, Too Specific, Too Broad, Opposite or Slant of the Passage, and In the Passage but Not Answering the Question</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Type #1 — Not in the Passage
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Many incorrect answer choices include information that is not in the passage
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the answer choice includes details that are not in the passage, the answer is incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Could you picture the detail being true? Maybe. Could it be possible? Sure. But we don't know it for sure from the passage.</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If we cannot point to evidence in the passage that supports an answer choice, we can only tell a story of why we think it could be true</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">As learned in Chapter 1: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">There is no storytelling!</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If an answer choice is not clearly supported by evidence in the passage, then it is always wrong</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example: Adam's Clothing
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Passage excerpt: "Adam rolled up the tattered sleeves of his sweater, exposing the winding snake tattoos on both of his forearms... Despite now living in upstate New York, he still wore his Army boots every day, the tops of which were hidden below his faded black jeans, the only pair that he owns..."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Question: "Which of the following can be assumed about Adam's clothing?"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">INCORRECT: "He only wears the most comfortable clothing" (not stated—we cannot point to evidence for this)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">INCORRECT: "The army provided him with free clothes" (not stated—this is storytelling)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">CORRECT: "His clothes are old and worn out" (supported by "tattered sleeves" and "faded black jeans")</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">INCORRECT: "He only owns one sweater" (not stated—the passage only mentions one pair of jeans)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Type #2 — Too Specific
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Incorrect answer choices are very commonly too specific
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Often, a single word or short phrase in an answer choice makes the entire answer incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If the answer choice is too specific and goes beyond what the passage says, it is always incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">As you read each answer choice, look for specific details and strong statements that could make it incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Ask yourself: "Does the passage really say that?"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Remember: The more specific and stronger an answer choice is, the more likely it will be incorrect</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example: Pelicans' Fishing Habits
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Passage excerpt: "Pelicans' diets include fish, amphibians, small turtles, crabs, and even other small birds... The groups of birds will form a line to drive schools of smaller fish into the shallower waters... and then scooping up their favorite prey."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Question: "Which of the following statements can be inferred from the passage?"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">INCORRECT: "Pelicans prey predominantly on fish during the summer months" (too specific—"summer months" not mentioned)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">INCORRECT: "Great White pelicans are the only species that hunt for turtles" (too specific—species not mentioned)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">CORRECT: "Small ocean fish are the main prey for pelicans" (supported by "favorite prey" referring to smaller fish)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">INCORRECT: "Pelicans do the majority of their hunting in shallow waters" (too specific—"majority" goes beyond what's stated)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Type #3 — Too Broad
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Sometimes an answer choice is incorrect because it is too broad
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">More common: The answer choice does not specifically answer the question being asked</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Less common: The answer does not match a more specific statement made in the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">While broad answer choices are better in general, make sure your choice is always specific enough to answer the exact question asked</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example: Darwin's Finches and Evolution
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Passage excerpt: "Dr. Anders Robert became fascinated with evolution... But he was never fully satisfied with Darwin's explanation... Dr. Robert will travel to the Galapagos Islands to study changes in the beaks of some of the same species of finches that Darwin studied..."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Question: "The main idea of the passage is to:"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">INCORRECT: "Research the theory of evolution using Darwin's finches" (too broad—doesn't answer what the passage is about)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">CORRECT: "Test a new idea about evolution by studying finches' beaks" (specific enough and captures the main idea)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">INCORRECT: "Highlight Dr. Robert's lifelong fascination with evolution" (too broad and "lifelong" not supported)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">INCORRECT: "Recreate Darwin's research" (word "recreate" doesn't match—he's testing his own new theory)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
5. Type #4 — Opposite or Slant of the Passage
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Many incorrect answers on the ACT are the opposite or a slant of what the passage states
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These answer choices often look correct because they include exact words or phrases from the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">However, they are incorrect because the answer choice is the opposite or a slant of what is in the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Do not pick an answer choice just because you find a word or phrase that is directly in the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Always make sure the answer choice is 100% correct—exact words from the passage are often in incorrect choices</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example: Ocean Currents
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Passage excerpt: "As water freezes in the North and South Poles, the water surrounding the ice becomes saltier and colder... The cold, salty water sinks due to its increased density... it travels southward to spread across the submerged surface of the earth... Warm water replaces it on the surface and moves to the north."
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Question: "Which statement about the global conveyor belt is best supported by the passage?"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">INCORRECT: "Cold, salty water comes to the surface" (opposite—passage says it sinks)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">INCORRECT: "The currents change with the seasons" (not in the passage)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">INCORRECT: "Melting ice is the first step" (opposite—passage says freezing water, not melting ice)</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">CORRECT: "Cold, salty water travels south on the ocean floor and warm water moves north on the surface" (matches passage)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
6. Type #5 — In the Passage but Not Answering the Question
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">This final type of incorrect answer is often the most difficult to avoid
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These are answer choices that are directly stated in the passage but do not answer the question being asked</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You will be able to go to the passage, find the information, and match it with the answer choice</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">However, it will still be incorrect because it doesn't answer what the question is asking!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Two Critical Reminders
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Reminder #1:</strong> Do not select an answer choice because it has a word or phrase that matches the passage
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Make sure the answer choice is 100% correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The ACT will often put exact words or phrases from the passage in incorrect answer choices to try to trick you</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Reminder #2:</strong> Finding evidence for an answer choice in the passage does not mean you found the correct answer
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You still need to make sure you are answering the question the ACT is asking</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Evidence in the passage + answering the question = correct answer</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Evidence in the passage alone ≠ correct answer (if it doesn't answer the question)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Key Takeaways
</h3>

<ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Type #1 (Not in the Passage): If an answer choice includes details not in the passage, it's incorrect—no matter how possible or logical it seems. There is no storytelling! If you can't point to evidence in the passage that clearly supports an answer choice, it's always wrong.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Type #2 (Too Specific) and Type #3 (Too Broad): Look for specific details and strong statements that could make an answer incorrect—often a single word makes the entire choice wrong. The more specific and stronger an answer is, the more likely it's incorrect. However, make sure your answer choice is still specific enough to answer the exact question being asked.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Type #4 (Opposite or Slant): Don't pick an answer just because it contains exact words or phrases from the passage—the ACT often puts passage words in incorrect choices. These answers are the opposite or a slant of what the passage actually says. Always verify the answer choice is 100% correct, not just that it contains familiar words.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Type #5 (In the Passage but Not Answering the Question): The most difficult type to avoid—these answers are directly stated in the passage and you can find evidence for them, but they still don't answer the question being asked. Finding evidence in the passage doesn't mean you found the correct answer; you must also answer the exact question the ACT is asking.
