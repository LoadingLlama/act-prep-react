1. Understanding Dual Text Passages
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Dual text passages include two short passages labeled as Passage A and Passage B
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The two passages discuss similar topics and are somehow related</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: Two scientists offering differing opinions on a recent discovery</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Questions always go in this order: Passage A Questions → Passage B Questions → Comparing Passages Questions (3 questions)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

How to Approach Dual Text Passages
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Recommended approach:</strong> Read each passage separately—do not read both passages before starting the questions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 1: Read Passage A and answer questions for Passage A</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 2: Read Passage B and answer questions for Passage B</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Step 3: Answer Comparing Passages Questions</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Since the passages are shorter, most students find it easier to read the entire passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Still apply whatever method you prefer from the ones discussed in Chapter 1.3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">If you work backwards:</strong> Answer questions for Passage A, then Passage B, then Comparing Passages Questions
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Use the questions to guide your reading of each passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Still save the Comparing Passages Questions for last</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Identifying Comparing Passages Questions
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Comparing passages questions are always the last 3 questions in the dual text passage
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Which of the following statements best captures the main difference in the purposes of the two passages?"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Example: "Which of the following statements about instruments is most strongly supported by details provided in Passage A and Passage B?"</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">The ACT will have a box telling you that the question asks about both passages</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">To answer correctly, you must use information from both passages</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
2. Tip #1 — Read the Answer Choices Right Away
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Comparing passages questions are generally quite broad, so you should always read the answer choices right away
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Once you've read the answer choices and know what the 4 options are, it's much easier to accomplish two things:</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">(1) Eliminate any answer choices that are clearly incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">(2) Know what to look for in Passage A and Passage B</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Without reading the answer choices first, you may waste time searching aimlessly through both passages</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
3. Tip #2 — Work Backwards More Actively with the Answer Choices
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Comparing passages questions generally have longer answer choices because the answer choice must refer to information in both passages
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When you see longer answer choices, work backwards more actively</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Look for specific details that do not match the passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Often, multiple answer choices are partly correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It's easier to look for what is incorrect about each answer choice rather than focusing on which seems most correct</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example Strategy
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Question: "The primary purpose of both passages is to:"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A. resolve a long-standing debate on the evolution of vampire bats</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">B. celebrate the findings of recent research by Brazilian scientists</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">C. present two competing theories on the development of echolocation in vampire bats</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">D. catalog evidence from multiple studies that supports a finding about vampire bats</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">We need to pick an answer that matches both passages
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Rather than looking for the correct answer, it's easier to eliminate choices that don't match one passage</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If Passage A only presents one theory about echolocation, C is incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If Passage B discusses a debate but doesn't resolve it, A is incorrect</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Working backwards with this thinking makes finding the correct answer easier</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
4. Tip #3 — Beware of Half-Right Answer Choices
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">For comparing passages questions, the ACT loves writing answer choices that are halfway correct
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Part of the answer choice perfectly answers the question</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">However, there is something wrong with the remaining portion of the answer choice</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Students often pick these incorrect choices because they get excited over the part that's correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">They don't read the rest of the answer choice carefully enough</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">As always, we need to be very picky when assessing each answer choice—especially for comparing passages questions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example of Half-Right Answer Choices
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Question: "Which choice best states the relationship between the two passages?"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A. Passage A provides an overview of a scientific discovery, while Passage B summarizes the experiments that led to that discovery</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">B. Passage A summarizes a scientific finding, while Passage B focuses on the potential applications of that finding</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">C. Passage A presents conflicting points of view on an issue, while Passage B presents evidence supporting a single view on that issue</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">D. Passage A considers how to best test two hypotheses, while Passage B argues that only one of the hypotheses is valid</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Notice how the first half of A and B are both very similar
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">These could both accurately describe Passage A, but only one can be correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">This means one of these answer choices must be half-right</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">It's important to focus on the second half of the answer choices to determine which is correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">As always, the correct answer must be 100% correct!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;">
5. Tip #4 — Do Not Focus on the Identical Parts of the Answer Choices
</h3>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Many comparing passages questions have portions of multiple answer choices that are identical
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">When you see identical parts in the answer choices, do not focus on the similarities</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Instead, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">focus on the differences</strong></li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Students make the mistake of trying to figure out which identical part is more correct, which is often impossible</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">You should focus on the differences in the rest of the answer choice—this is what actually determines which is correct</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 600;">
Example of Identical Parts
</h4>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Question: "How do the two passages differ in the attitudes of each author towards women serving in the army?"
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">A. Smith implies that women should be prevented from serving in the army, whereas Jones supports women serving in the army in non-combat roles</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">B. Smith believes that women with certain physical abilities can be considered for service in the army, whereas Jones assumes that physical ability is unrelated to any person's ability to serve</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">C. Smith argues that service should be a personal choice regardless of gender, whereas Jones contends that women are unsuitable to serve due to emotional instability</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">D. Smith asserts that anyone who can serve in the army should be able to do so, whereas Jones argues that men and women should serve in gender-specific roles</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">The first half of C and D are both saying the same thing: anyone should be able to serve
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If Smith argues that in Passage A, there's no way to tell if C or D is correct by focusing on the first half alone</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Instead, we need to look at the rest of the answer choices and focus on the differences</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.7;">
  <li style="margin: 0.3rem 0;">Similarly, the second half of A and D are making almost identical statements
    <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Both say men and women should have separate roles in the army</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">If Jones argued that in Passage B, don't focus on determining which is more correct</li>
      <li style="margin: 0.2rem 0;">Instead, look at the first half of those answer choices and focus on the differences to find which is correct</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Key Takeaways
</h3>

<ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>For dual text passages, read each passage separately and answer questions in order: Passage A questions, Passage B questions, then the 3 Comparing Passages Questions at the end. Since the passages are shorter, most students find it easier to read the entire passage, but still apply your preferred method from Chapter 1.3.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Always read the answer choices right away for comparing passages questions since they're generally quite broad. This makes it easier to eliminate clearly incorrect choices and know what to look for in both passages. Work backwards more actively with these longer answer choices—look for specific details that don't match rather than focusing on which seems most correct.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>Beware of half-right answer choices—the ACT loves to write choices where part perfectly answers the question but something is wrong with the remaining portion. Students often pick these because they get excited over the correct part and don't read the rest carefully. Remember: the correct answer must be 100% correct!
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem; color: #2e7d32; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <span style="color: #4caf50; font-weight: bold; margin-right: 0.5rem;">✓</span>When multiple answer choices have identical parts, do not focus on the similarities—focus on the differences. Trying to figure out which identical part is "more correct" is often impossible and wastes time. The differences in the rest of the answer choice are what actually determine which answer is correct.
