<html><head></head><body><p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The ACT Reading section presents unique challenges that require mastering passage comprehension, time management strategies, critical analysis skills, and evidence-based reasoning. With only 35 minutes to read four passages and answer 40 questions, you must develop efficient reading techniques that balance speed with accuracy.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">This lesson provides a comprehensive overview of the Reading section structure, explains what skills are tested, introduces the four passage types you'll encounter, and outlines proven strategies for maximizing your score on this fast-paced section.</p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 1. Understanding the Reading Section Format </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">The ACT Reading section is the third section of the test and consists of four passages with ten questions each. You have exactly 35 minutes to complete all 40 questions, which means approximately 8 minutes and 45 seconds per passage including both reading time and question-answering time.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Understanding the structure and format of this section is essential for developing an effective test-taking strategy.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Section Timing and Question Distribution </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">40 questions: . Each passage is approximately 750-900 words long and accompanied by exactly 10 questions. Unlike some standardized tests where passages vary in difficulty, all four ACT Reading passages are designed to be roughly equivalent in challenge level</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">However, individual students may find certain passage types easier based on their interests and background knowledge. The strict time constraint—just over 8.5 minutes per passage—makes the Reading section one of the most time-pressured parts of the ACT. Most students report that finishing all four passages is their biggest challenge.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Passage Order and Organization </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Humanities:</strong> (third), and</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Natural Science: (fourth). However, you are NOT required to complete the passages in this order. Strategic test-takers often rearrange the order to tackle their strongest passage types first, building confidence and banking time for more challenging passages later. Each passage is clearly labeled with its type, author information</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">sometimes a brief italicized introduction that provides context. Questions are numbered consecutively from 1-40 across all four passages (not 1-10 for each passage), so passage one has questions 1-10, passage two has questions 11-20, and so on.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Question Format and Answer Choices </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">four answer options: (A, B, C, D). Unlike the ACT English section which has three-choice questions</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Reading questions always have four choices. Each question has exactly one correct answer, and there is</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">no penalty for guessing: —wrong answers do not subtract from your score. Questions appear to the right of the passage (or below it in the online format)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">you can refer back to the passage as many times as needed. Most questions are passage-based, meaning you must find evidence in the text to support your answer. A few questions may ask about vocabulary in context or require you to make reasonable inferences based on textual clues.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Scoring and Raw-to-Scale Conversion </h4> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Your Reading section score is based on the number of questions you answer correctly, called your raw score. This raw score (0-40) is then converted to a scaled score from 1-36 using a conversion table that varies slightly from test to test to account for minor difficulty differences.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Generally, missing 2-3 questions still allows you to achieve a score in the 33-35 range, while missing 6-8 questions typically results in a score around 28-30. The conversion is designed so that a scaled score of 36 requires a perfect or near-perfect raw score (39-40 correct), while a scaled score of 20 (roughly average) corresponds to answering about 23-26 questions correctly.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Because the scoring curve is relatively generous at the top end, even high-achieving students can afford to miss a few questions and still receive excellent scores.</p> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Example: Section Breakdown</strong><br><br> Passage 1 (Prose Fiction): Questions 1-10 | ~8:45 minutes<br> Passage 2 (Social Science): Questions 11-20 | ~8:45 minutes<br> Passage 3 (Humanities): Questions 21-30 | ~8:45 minutes<br> Passage 4 (Natural Science): Questions 31-40 | ~8:45 minutes<br><br> Total: 40 questions in 35 minutes = approximately 52.5 seconds per question, but you must account for reading time as well, which is why the per-passage timing works better as a guide. </p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 2. The Four Passage Types Explained </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Each ACT Reading section contains exactly four passages, each representing a different content area. Understanding the characteristics of each passage type helps you know what to expect and allows you to develop specialized strategies for each category.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">While the question types remain similar across all passages, the content, writing style, and focus differ significantly.</p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Prose Fiction and Literary Narrative </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Prose Fiction/Literary Narrative:</strong> passage is always the first passage and features excerpts from short stories, novels, memoirs, or personal essays. These passages focus on</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">literary devices: . You'll need to understand character motivations, identify tone and mood, track plot developments, and interpret figurative language. Questions often ask about a character's emotions, the narrator's perspective, or the significance of specific events. Literary passages can be challenging because they require careful attention to nuance, subtext</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">implied meanings rather than just explicit facts. To succeed with fiction passages, pay attention to dialogue, character interactions, descriptive details, and shifts in tone or perspective.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Social Science </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Social Science:</strong> passage appears second and covers topics from anthropology, archaeology, biography, business, economics, education, geography, history, political science, psychology, and sociology. These passages present</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">theories: in an informative, expository style. Questions typically test your ability to identify main ideas, understand supporting details, recognize cause-and-effect relationships, and follow the author's argument or analysis</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Social Science passages tend to be more straightforward than fiction because they explicitly state facts and conclusions rather than implying them. However, they may contain dense information that requires careful tracking of multiple concepts, names, dates, or statistics. Strong annotation and note-taking strategies are particularly useful for these passages.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Humanities </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Humanities:</strong> passage is third and includes content related to architecture, art, dance, ethics, film, language, literary criticism, music, philosophy, radio, television, and theater. These passages often discuss</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">critical analysis of creative works: . The writing style falls somewhere between Literary Narrative and Social Science—more personal and opinion-based than pure exposition but more analytical than storytelling</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Questions may ask you to identify the author's perspective on an artist or movement, understand historical context, or recognize how the author supports their claims about cultural significance. Humanities passages sometimes include the author's personal reflections or evaluative judgments, so pay attention to distinguishing between objective facts and subjective opinions.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Natural Science </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Natural Science:</strong> passage appears fourth and covers topics from anatomy, astronomy, biology, botany, chemistry, ecology, geology, medicine, meteorology, microbiology, natural history, physiology, physics, technology, and zoology. These passages explain</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">technological innovations: . The writing is typically expository and informative, similar to what you'd find in a science textbook or popular science magazine. Questions test whether you understand scientific processes, can identify cause-and-effect relationships, comprehend technical vocabulary in context</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">follow the logic of scientific explanations. Don't worry if you're not familiar with the specific scientific topic—all necessary information is provided in the passage. However, Natural Science passages can be challenging due to complex terminology, detailed descriptions of processes, and abstract concepts that require visualization.</li></ul> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Example: Passage Type Characteristics Prose Fiction: Focus on character emotions, narrative perspective, and literary themes. Look for "The narrator feels..." or "The passage suggests that the character..." Social Science: Focus on factual information, historical context, and analytical arguments</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Look for "According to the passage..." or "The author indicates that..." Humanities: Focus on artistic significance, cultural analysis, and the author's perspective. Look for "The author believes..." or "The passage describes the artist's work as..." Natural Science: Focus on scientific processes, technical explanations, and cause-effect relationships</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Look for "The passage explains that..." or "According to the research described..."</p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 3. Core Skills Tested in the Reading Section </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> The ACT Reading section assesses three main categories of reading comprehension skills: <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Key Ideas and Details</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Craft and Structure</strong>, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Integration of Knowledge and Ideas</strong>. Understanding which skills are being tested helps you approach questions more strategically and develop targeted improvement strategies. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Key Ideas and Details (55-60% of questions) </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">identify cause-effect relationships: . Questions might ask: "What is the main idea of the passage?", "According to the passage, what caused X to happen?", "The author indicates that...", or "Which of the following statements about X is supported by the passage?" These questions require close reading and the ability to distinguish between major themes and supporting details</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">When answering Key Ideas questions, always refer back to the passage—don't rely on memory or outside knowledge. The correct answer will have direct textual support, even if the question requires you to paraphrase or synthesize information from multiple sentences.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Craft and Structure (25-30% of questions) </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">rhetorical strategies: . You might encounter questions like: "As it is used in line 42, the word 'revolutionary' most nearly means...", "The author's tone in the third paragraph can best be described as...", "The primary purpose of the first paragraph is to...", or "From whose perspective is the passage told?" To answer these questions successfully, pay attention not just to what the author says but how they say it</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Consider the connotations of specific word choices, the emotional effect of descriptive language, the organizational structure of paragraphs, and the overall rhetorical approach the author takes to convey their message.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Integration of Knowledge and Ideas (13-18% of questions) </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">draw conclusions: . Questions might ask: "Which of the following claims is best supported by evidence in the passage?", "The passage suggests that...", "It can reasonably be inferred that...", or "The author would most likely agree with which statement?" These questions require you to go beyond literal comprehension and think critically about implications, assumptions</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">logical connections. When the passage presents two texts (which happens occasionally), Integration questions may ask you to compare and contrast the authors' perspectives or synthesize information from both passages. Strong critical thinking skills and the ability to distinguish between what the passage explicitly states versus what it implies are essential for these questions.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Reading Comprehension vs. Reading Speed </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">reading efficiency: . Unlike untimed reading assignments where you can reread multiple times and think deeply about every sentence</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">the ACT requires you to balance thorough understanding with time constraints. The most successful students develop</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">active reading strategies: that allow them to extract essential information quickly while still retaining enough detail to answer questions accurately. This means learning to identify what's important (main ideas, key supporting details, author's purpose) versus what's less critical (minor examples, tangential descriptions) during your first read-through</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">With practice, you can improve both your reading speed and comprehension simultaneously by training yourself to recognize patterns in passage structure and question types.</li></ul> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Example: Question Type Distribution</strong><br><br> In a typical Reading section:<br> - 22-24 questions test Key Ideas and Details (main ideas, supporting details, sequences, cause-effect)<br> - 10-12 questions test Craft and Structure (vocabulary, author's purpose, tone, point of view)<br> - 5-7 questions test Integration of Knowledge and Ideas (inferences, arguments, conclusions)<br><br> Knowing this distribution helps you anticipate what skills you'll need to apply most frequently and where to focus your practice efforts. </p> <h3 style="margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 700;"> 4. Building a Foundation for Success </h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"> Mastering the ACT Reading section requires more than just understanding the format and question types—you need to develop <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">systematic strategies</strong>, <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">efficient reading habits</strong>, and <strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">test-taking discipline</strong>. This section introduces foundational concepts that will support your development as a strategic ACT reader. </p> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Developing Active Reading Techniques </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">Active reading:</strong> means engaging with the text purposefully rather than passively absorbing words. On the ACT, this involves</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">annotation:</strong> (underlining key phrases, circling important names or dates, making brief margin notes)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">prediction:</strong> (anticipating what information might be tested), and</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">summarization: (mentally paraphrasing each paragraph's main point as you read). Active reading keeps your mind focused and helps you retain information better than passive reading</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Even simple techniques like underlining topic sentences or putting brackets around important examples can significantly improve your ability to locate information when answering questions. However, avoid over-annotating—excessive marking can be just as ineffective as no annotation at all. Focus on highlighting only the most essential information.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Understanding the Relationship Between Passages and Questions </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">passage-based comprehension:</strong> which means every correct answer must be supported by evidence in the text. Questions generally follow the</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">chronological order: of the passage—questions 1-3 relate to the beginning, questions 4-7 to the middle, and questions 8-10 to the end. However, some questions (particularly main idea or author's purpose questions) require you to consider the entire passage</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Understanding this relationship helps you work more efficiently: when you see a question about a specific detail, you know approximately where in the passage to look based on the question number. Questions also frequently include</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">line references:</strong> (e.g., "In lines 45-48...") or</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">paragraph references:</strong> (e.g., "The third paragraph primarily serves to...") to guide you to the relevant section.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Recognizing Wrong Answer Patterns </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">wrong answer traps:</strong> is just as important as identifying correct answers. The ACT frequently uses several types of incorrect answer choices:</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">too extreme:</strong> (using absolute language like "always" or "never" when the passage is more nuanced)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">distortion:</strong> (twisting information from the passage in a way that changes its meaning)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">out of scope:</strong> (bringing in outside information or addressing topics not discussed in the passage)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;"><strong style="color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">opposite:</strong> (stating the reverse of what the passage says), and</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">partially correct: (including some accurate information but also containing a critical error)</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Learning to identify these patterns allows you to  wrong answers more quickly and confidently, even when you're not 100% certain which answer is correct.</li></ul> <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.3rem; font-weight: 400;"> Creating a Personal Strategy and Improving Through Practice </h4> <ul style="margin: 0.3rem 0 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;"><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">personalized approaches: based on their strengths, weaknesses, and natural reading preferences. Some students prefer to skim the passage quickly first, then read questions and return to find answers</li><li style="margin: 0.15rem 0;">Others read carefully the first time, annotating heavily, then answer questions from memory before checking the passage. Still others read questions first to know what to look for, then read the passage with those questions in mind.
