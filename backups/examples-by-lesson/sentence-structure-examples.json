      "answer_explanation": "The original sentence is a fragment because it lacks a main verb.\n\n**Step 1: Read the sentence and identify the problem**\nThe sentence reads: \"In the late 1960s, the \\\"must-have\\\" toy at the Cincinnati Toy Fair a new type of diecast toy car...\"\n\nWhen you read this aloud, you should feel like something is missing. Where is the verb? What happened at the Toy Fair?\n\n**Step 2: Find the split point**\nThe underlined portion is \"Fair a\"—we need to determine what should come after \"Fair\"\n\n**Step 3: Test each choice**\n- **A (NO CHANGE - \"Fair a\"):** Still no verb connecting the subject to what it is. Fragment!\n- **B (\"Fair,\"):** Adds a comma but still no verb. Fragment!\n- **C (\"Fair;\"):** Semicolons connect independent clauses, but neither side is independent without a verb. Fragment!\n- **D (\"Fair was\"):** Perfect! \"Was\" is the linking verb. Now we have: \"The toy...Fair was a new type of diecast toy car.\" Complete sentence!\n\nThe answer is **D**.",

With just a comma, this creates an error.\n- **B (\"therefore\"):** Same problem—\"therefore\" isn't a FANBOYS word.\n- **C (\"and\"):** \"After hummingbirds evolved...flowers and this advantage allowed...\" The FANBOYS word \"and\" properly connects these clauses. Correct!\n- **D (DELETE):** This would create: \"...flowers, this evolutionary advantage...\" While this follows Rule #4 (Dependent + comma + Independent), the connection is unclear.\n\n**Why C is best:**\nThe FANBOYS word \"and\" creates the clearest connection between the evolution and its result.\n\nThe answer is **C**.",

Follows Rule #2 perfectly! Correct!\n\n- **B (\"sport even though\"):** Independent + no comma + Dependent. This follows Rule #5! Also correct grammatically!\n\n- **C (\"sport, so\"):** Grammatically this follows Rule #2, BUT logically it doesn't make sense. Being bad at skating isn't CAUSED by loving hockey. Incorrect due to illogical meaning.\n\n- **D (\"sport; although\"):** Semicolons must connect TWO independent clauses, but \"although I cannot skate very well\" is dependent. Incorrect!\n\n**Why A is the best answer:**\nChoice A properly uses comma + FANBOYS and maintains logical meaning (contrast between loving hockey BUT being unable to skate).\n\nThe answer is **A**.",
