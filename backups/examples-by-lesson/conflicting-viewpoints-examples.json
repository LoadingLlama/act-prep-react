Carbon dioxide (CO₂) levels have increased by 40% since pre-industrial times, and CO₂ is a greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere. The timing of temperature increases matches perfectly with industrialization. Natural factors like solar activity and volcanic eruptions cannot account for the rapid warming we observe.</p>\n\n  <p style=\"font-weight: 700; font-size: 16px; margin: 1.2rem 0 0.75rem 0; color: #1f2937;\">Scientist 2</p>\n  <p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.6;\">While CO₂ levels have increased, natural cycles are the primary driver of temperature changes. Earth has experienced many warming and cooling periods long before human industrialization. Solar radiation varies over time, and these variations can explain temperature fluctuations. The current warming trend is consistent with natural climate variability, not unprecedented.</p>\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-top: 2.5rem; font-weight: 600; font-size: 17px; color: #1f2937;\">On which of the following points do the scientists agree?</p>",
