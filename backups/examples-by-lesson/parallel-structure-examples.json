      "answer_explanation": "This tests basic parallel structure in a three-item list.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the list**\n\"Made her bed,\" \"cleaning the shelves,\" \"swept the kitchen floor\"\n\n**Step 2: Check grammatical forms**\n- \"Made\" = past tense verb\n- \"Cleaning\" = gerund (verb + ing)\n- \"Swept\" = past tense verb\n\nNot parallel! Two are past tense, one is a gerund.\n\n**Step 3: Determine what form to use**\nThe first and third items use past tense verbs, so the second should too.\n\n**Step 4: Test choices**\n- **A:** \"cleaning\" doesn't match \"made\" and \"swept.\" Incorrect!\n- **B:** \"cleaned\" matches the past tense pattern. Correct!\n- **C:** Adds \"she\" which isn't in the other items. Incorrect!\n- **D:** \"was cleaning\" is past progressive, doesn't match. Incorrect!\n\nThe answer is **B**.",

Incorrect!\n- **B:** \"get...than to pay\" — Wait, actually \"get...than pay\" would be best, but \"to pay\" creates parallelism with the infinitive structure. Correct!\n- **C:** \"getting...than paying\" — both gerunds, parallel, but doesn't work with \"would rather.\" Incorrect!\n- **D:** \"to get...than to pay\" — both infinitives, but \"would rather\" takes base verb not infinitive.
