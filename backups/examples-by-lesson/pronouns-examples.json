      "answer_explanation": "This tests \"who\" vs. \"whom\" in a descriptive phrase.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the phrase**\n\"who opened up a shop down the street\" is a descriptive phrase telling us more about the florists.\n\n**Step 2: Use the he/him replacement trick for just the phrase**\nLook only at the phrase: \"who opened up a shop down the street\"\n\nCan we say \"he opened up a shop down the street\"? ✓ Yes!\nCan we say \"him opened up a shop down the street\"? ✗ No!\n\nSince \"he\" works, we use \"who\" (not \"whom\").\n\n**Step 3: Use the quick trick**\nLook at the word right after \"who/whom\": \"opened\"\n\n\"Opened\" is a verb → Use \"who\"\n\n**Step 4: Test each choice**\n- **A (NO CHANGE - \"who\"):** The florists did the action (they opened up a shop), so we need the subject pronoun \"who.\" Using the he/him trick on the phrase confirms \"he opened\" works. Correct!\n\n- **B (\"whom\"):** This is the object pronoun. Test with the phrase: \"whom opened up a shop\" → \"him opened up a shop\" doesn't work. Incorrect!\n\n- **C (\"which\"):** \"Which\" is used for things, not people. The florists are people, so we can't use \"which.\" Incorrect!\n\n- **D (\"that\"):** While \"that\" can sometimes be used for people, \"who\" is more grammatically precise when referring to people performing an action. \"Who\" is the better choice. Incorrect!\n\n**Why A is correct:**\nThe word after \"who\" is a verb (\"opened\"), and using the he/him test on the phrase shows \"he opened\" works, so \"who\" is correct.\n\nThe answer is **A**.",

Incorrect!\n\n- **D (\"the customer\"):** This would mean the customer always smiles. While this eliminates ambiguity, it changes the meaning.
