      "answer_explanation": "The context suggests the footage was previously unseen or hidden. \"Revealed\" means to uncover or make known something that was hidden, which fits perfectly with \"rare footage.\" \"Exhibited\" and \"displayed\" mean to show something on purpose, but don't capture the sense of discovery. \"Outlined\" means to give a summary, which doesn't fit visual footage.
