Keep in mind that there is no single best approach to the ACT Reading, but there is a best approach for you.\n            </div>\n\n            <p>The right approach depends on your reading speed, your reading level, and a variety of other factors, all of which we will discuss in this chapter.</p>\n\n            <p>The best way to find your favorite method is trial and error. Try different methods on practice ACTs and see which one you find the most effective. Once you find your preferred method, use that same method over and over on practice ACTs so you feel confident in your approach for test day.</p>\n\n            <h3>Our 6 Approaches for ACT Reading Passages</h3>\n            <p>We have 6 different approaches that we recommend for our students:</p>\n            <ol>\n                <li>The Big Read</li>\n                <li>The Big Read with Notes</li>\n                <li>Label Then Read</li>\n                <li>The Speed Reader</li>\n                <li>First and Last</li>\n                <li>Working Backwards</li>\n            </ol>\n\n            <div class=\"concept-box\">\n                <h4>Approach #1 – The Big Read</h4>\n                <p><strong>Method:</strong> Read the entire passage at once and then work through the questions.</p>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>Read the entire passage including the short intro above the passage</li>\n                    <li>Read to understand the passage; do not skim the passage</li>\n                    <li>Read the passage in 2-4 minutes (3-6 minutes for extended time) at a medium pace</li>\n                    <li>Be an active reader.
