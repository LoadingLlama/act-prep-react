Standard deviation tells you how spread out data is from the mean—a critical concept for understanding data variability.</p>\n             \n            <h3>Standard Deviation: What Does It Mean?</h3>\n            \n<p>Standard deviation (σ) measures how far, on average, each data point is from the mean. It quantifies the \"spread\" of data:</p>\n            \n<ul>\n                \n<li><strong>Small standard deviation:</strong>Data is clustered tightly around the mean</li>\n                \n<li><strong>Large standard deviation:</strong>Data is spread far from the mean</li>\n                        </ul>\n             \n            <h3>Calculating Standard Deviation</h3>\n            \n<p>Follow these steps:</p>\n            \n<ol>\n                \n<li>Find the mean of the data set</li>\n                \n<li>Subtract the mean from each data point (these are deviations)</li>\n                \n<li>Square each deviation</li>\n                \n<li>Find the average of the squared deviations (this is the variance)</li>\n                \n<li>Take the square root of the variance (this is the standard deviation)</li>\n                        </ol>\n             \n            <h3>Example Calculation</h3>\n            \n<p>Data: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10</p>\n            \n<p><strong>Step 1:</strong>Mean = (2+4+6+8+10)/5 = 6</p>\n            \n<p><strong>Step 2:</strong>Deviations: -4, -2, 0, 2, 4</p>\n            \n<p><strong>Step 3:</strong>Squared deviations: 16, 4, 0, 4, 16</p>\n            \n<p><strong>Step 4:</strong>Variance = (16+4+0+4+16)/5 = 8</p>\n            \n<p><strong>Step 5:</strong>Standard deviation = √8 ≈ 2.83</p>\n             \n            <h3>Understanding Variance</h3>\n            \n<p>Variance (σ²) is the square of standard deviation. It's useful mathematically but less intuitive because its units are squared. Standard deviation is preferred for interpretation.</p>\n             \n            <h3>The 68-95-99.7 Rule (Normal Distribution)</h3>\n            \n<p>For normally distributed data:</p>\n            \n<ul>\n                \n<li>~68% of data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean</li>\n                \n<li>~95% falls within 2 standard deviations</li>\n                \n<li>~99.7% falls within 3 standard deviations</li>\n                        </ul>\n             \n            <h3>Comparing Datasets</h3>\n            \n<p>Two datasets can have the same mean but different standard deviations:</p>\n            \n<p>Set A: 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 (σ = 0, no variation)</p>\n            \n<p>Set B: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 (σ &gt; 0, has variation)</p>\n            \n<p>Both have mean = 5, but Set B has much more spread!</p>\n             \n            <h3>Example Problems</h3>\n             \n            <h4>Example 1</h4>\n            \n<p><strong>Problem:</strong>Which dataset has the larger standard deviation?</p>\n            \n<p>Set A: 10, 12, 14, 16, 18<br>Set B: 10, 11, 14, 17, 18</p>\n            \n<p>A. Set A<br>B. Set B<br>C. They're equal<br>D. Cannot be determined</p>\n            \n<p><strong>Solution:</strong>Both sets have the same range and mean (14), but Set A has evenly spaced values while Set B has values clustered near the extremes. Calculating both:</p>\n            \n<p>Set A: σ ≈ 2.83 (evenly distributed)</p>\n            \n<p>Set B: σ ≈ 3.16 (more clustered at edges)</p>\n            \n<p><strong>Answer: B</strong></p>\n             \n            <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>\n            \n<p>Standard deviation measures spread. Small σ means data is tightly clustered; large σ means it's spread out. You often don't need to calculate it exactly—just understand which dataset is more spread out. The ACT usually provides standard deviation values and asks you to interpret them.</p>\n            \n</body></html>\n        ",
