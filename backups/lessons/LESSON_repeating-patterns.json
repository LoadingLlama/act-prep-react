The key is to look for common operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division between consecutive terms.</p>\n             \n            <h3>Finding Patterns in Number Sequences</h3>\n            \n<p>When you see a sequence like 2, 5, 8, 11, 14..., ask yourself:</p>\n            \n<ul>\n                \n<li>What operation connects consecutive numbers?</li>\n                \n<li>Is the difference between terms constant? (Arithmetic sequence)</li>\n                \n<li>Is the ratio between terms constant? (Geometric sequence)</li>\n                \n<li>Is there a more complex pattern? (Squares, powers, factorials, etc.)</li>\n                        </ul>\n             \n            <h3>Common Pattern Types</h3>\n             \n            <h4>1. Adding/Subtracting a Constant</h4>\n            \n<p>Example: 3, 7, 11, 15... (add 4 each time)</p>\n             \n            <h4>2. Multiplying/Dividing by a Constant</h4>\n            \n<p>Example: 2, 6, 18, 54... (multiply by 3 each time)</p>\n             \n            <h4>3. Perfect Squares or Powers</h4>\n            \n<p>Example: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25... (1², 2², 3², 4², 5²)</p>\n             \n            <h4>4. Alternating Patterns</h4>\n            \n<p>Example: 1, -1, 1, -1... (alternating signs)</p>\n             \n            <h3>Step-by-Step Strategy</h3>\n            \n<ol>\n                \n<li>Write down the differences between consecutive terms</li>\n                \n<li>Check if the differences are constant (arithmetic sequence)</li>\n                \n<li>If not, check the ratios between consecutive terms</li>\n                \n<li>Look for special sequences (squares, cubes, primes, etc.)</li>\n                \n<li>Test your pattern by checking it works for all given terms</li>\n                        </ol>\n             \n            <h3>Example Problems</h3>\n             \n            <h4>Example 1</h4>\n            \n<p><strong>Problem:</strong>What is the next number in the sequence: 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, ?</p>\n            \n<p>A. 36<br>B. 40<br>C. 42<br>D. 44</p>\n            \n<p><strong>Solution:</strong>Look at the differences between terms:</p>\n            \n<p>6-2=4, 12-6=6, 20-12=8, 30-20=10</p>\n            \n<p>The differences form a pattern: 4, 6, 8, 10... (increasing by 2)</p>\n            \n<p>So the next difference should be 12, making the next term: 30 + 12 = 42</p>\n            \n<p><strong>Answer: C</strong></p>\n             \n            <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>\n            \n<p>Always look at the differences between consecutive terms first. If those differences aren't constant, check if the differences themselves form a pattern. Pattern questions test your ability to spot relationships—practice is key!</p>\n            \n</body></html>\n        ",
