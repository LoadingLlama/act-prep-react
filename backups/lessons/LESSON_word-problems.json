The key is identifying what you know, what you need to find, and which mathematical concept applies. Let's develop a systematic approach!</p>\n            \n            <h3>The Four-Step Strategy</h3>\n            \n            <h4>1. READ</h4>\n            <p>Carefully read the problem. Identify key information and what's being asked.</p>\n            \n            <h4>2. PLAN</h4>\n            <p>Choose which math concept to use. Set up an equation or method.</p>\n            \n            <h4>3. SOLVE</h4>\n            <p>Work through the math carefully. Show your steps. Does your answer make sense? Match the question asked?</p>\n            \n            <h4>4. CHECK</h4>\n            \n            <h3>Common Word Problem Types</h3>\n            \n            <h4>Distance = Rate × Time</h4>\n            <p>d = r × t: A car travels 60 mph for 3 hours. Distance = 60 × 3 = 180 miles</p>\n            \n            <h4>Work Problems</h4>\n            <p>Rate + Rate = Combined Rate</p>\n            \n<p>If A does a job in 4 hrs and B in 6 hrs, together: 1/4 + 1/6 = 5/12 per hour</p>\n            \n            <h4>Mixture Problems</h4>\n            <p>Total = Part₁ + Part₂</p>\n            \n<p>Mix 30% solution with 60% solution. Use weighted average!</p>\n            \n            <h4>Age Problems</h4>\n            <p>Set up equations</p>\n            \n<p>John is 3 years older than Mary. If their sum is 27, find their ages!</p>\n            \n            <h3>Worked Example: Distance Problem</h3>\n            \n            <h4>A train travels 240 miles in 4 hours. What is its average speed?</h4>\n            <p><strong>Step 1: Identify what we know:</strong></p>\n            \n<p><strong>Step 2: Choose formula and solve for r</strong><br>Distance (d) = 240 miles\nTime (t) = 4 hours\nNeed to find: Rate (r)\nd = r × t\n240 = r × 4\nr = 240 ÷ 4\nr = 60 mph</p>\n            \n<p><strong>Step 3: Check - Does it make sense? Yes! 60 mph × 4 hours = 240 miles</strong></p>\n            \n            <h3>Key Translation Phrases</h3>\n            <p>\"More than\" / \"Sum\": +</p>\n            \n<p>\"Less than\" / \"Difference\": −</p>\n            \n<p>\"Times\" / \"Product of\": ×</p>\n            \n<p>\"Divided by\" / \"Per\": ÷</p>\n            \n<p>\"Is\" / \"Equals\": =</p>\n            \n            <h3>Example Problem</h3>\n            \n            <h4>Example 1</h4>\n            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>Sarah is 3 years older than Tom. If their combined age is 27, how old is Tom?</p>\n            \n<p>A. 10<br>B. 12<br>C. 14<br>D. 15</p>\n            \n<p><strong>Solution:</strong>Let Tom's age = t. Then Sarah = t + 3</p>\n            \n<p>t + (t + 3) = 27\n2t + 3 = 27\n2t = 24\nt = 12</p>\n            \n<p><strong>Answer: B</strong></p>\n            \n            <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>\n            <p>Read carefully, identify what you know and need to find, translate words to math, solve, and check! Practice recognizing common problem types: distance, work, mixture, and age problems.</p>\n            </body></html>\n        ",
