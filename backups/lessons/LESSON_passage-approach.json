Here's how to tackle them effectively.\n            </div>\n            \n            <h3>Charts & Graphs Strategies</h3>\n            <p>For the five charts and graphs passages:</p>\n            \n            <div class=\"rules-box\">\n                <h4>30-Second Rule</h4>\n                <p>Spend around 30 seconds before starting on the questions. Focus on:</p>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>Labels of the axes</li>\n                    <li>What is being measured in each chart</li>\n                    <li>Where information is located</li>\n                    <li>Read only the first sentence of the passage and experiments</li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n            \n            <div class=\"tip-box\">\n                <h4>Key Strategy</h4>\n                <p>Most of the information in charts and graphs passages is extra and unnecessary. Don't spend time trying to read and understand the entire passageâ€”it's not necessary and you will run out of time!</p>\n            </div>\n            \n            <h3>Question Difficulty Progression</h3>\n            <p>Within each passage, questions go from easy to hard. The first 2-3 questions are generally straightforward, often just asking you to spot a trend or find a data point. Later questions can get more difficult.</p>\n            \n            <h3>Conflicting Viewpoints Strategy</h3>\n            <div class=\"concept-box\">\n                <h4>Different Approach Required</h4>\n                <p>Rather than skimming, you must treat this more like a reading passage:</p>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>Read and annotate the entire passage</li>\n                    <li>Underline key differences between viewpoints</li>\n                    <li>Most students save this passage for last as it's most time-consuming</li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n            \n            <h3>Time Management Tips</h3>\n            <div class=\"tip-box\">\n                <h4>5-6 Minutes Per Passage</h4>\n                <p>If you spend more than 30 seconds on a problem, bubble in your best guess, circle the question, and move on. You can always come back if you have time.</p>\n            </div>\n            \n            <div class=\"key-takeaway\">\n                <h4>Remember</h4>\n                <p>Trust the questions! If a question begins with \"Based on Figure 2,\" the answer is in Figure 2. The ACT is not trying to trick you.</p>\n            </div>\n        ",
