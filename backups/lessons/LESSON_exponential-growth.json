What's the population after 3 years?</p>\n            \n<p><strong>Step 1: Identify the values:</strong></p>\n            \n<p><strong>Step 2: Use the growth formula</strong><br>a = 500 (initial population)\nr = 0.08 (8% as decimal)\nt = 3 (years)\ny = a(1 + r)ᵗ\ny = 500(1 + 0.08)³\ny = 500(1.08)³</p>\n            \n<p><strong>Step 3: Calculate: Compound interest is a special case of exponential growth where money grows based on interest rate!</strong><br>1.08³ ≈ 1.2597\n500 × 1.2597 ≈ 629.85\nPopulation ≈ 630</p>\n            \n            <h3>Compound Interest</h3>\n            <p>Compound Interest Formula: A = P(1 + r/n)ⁿᵗ:<strong>P</strong>= Principal (initial amount):<strong>r</strong>= Annual interest rate (as decimal):<strong>n</strong>= Times compounded per year:<strong>t</strong>= Number of years</p>\n            \n            <h3>Example Problem</h3>\n            \n            <h4>Example 1</h4>\n            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>A car worth $20,000 depreciates 15% per year.

Decay: multiply by (1 − r). The exponent t is always the number of time periods. Convert percentages to decimals before calculating!</p>\n            </body></html>\n        ",
