These appear frequently on the ACT, so let's master them from the ground up!</p>\n            \n            <h3>What is a Quadratic?</h3>\n            <p>A quadratic is any equation with x²</p>\n            \n<p>Quadratics make a U - shaped curve called a<strong>parabola</strong>. Opens up (∪) if x² coefficient is positive, down (∩) if negative.</p>\n            \n            <h3>Three Forms of Quadratics</h3>\n            \n            <h4>Standard Form</h4>\n            <p>ax² + bx + c = 0</p>\n            \n<p>General form—use this with the quadratic formula</p>\n            \n            <h4>Factored Form</h4>\n            <p>a(x − r₁)(x − r₂) = 0</p>\n            \n<p>Shows roots directly: r₁ and r₂</p>\n            \n            <h4>Vertex Form</h4>\n            <p>a(x − h)² + k</p>\n            \n<p>Shows vertex directly: (h, k)</p>\n            \n            <h3>The Quadratic Formula</h3>\n            <p>MEMORIZE - Not on ACT formula sheet</p>\n            \n<p>x = (−b ± √(b² − 4ac)) / (2a)</p>\n            \n<p>For any quadratic ax² + bx + c = 0: CRITICAL</p>\n            \n<p>This formula is NOT on the ACT reference sheet—you MUST memorize it! It's tested frequently.</p>\n            \n            <h3>Factoring Quadratics</h3>\n            <p>For simple quadratics (when a = 1), try factoring first! It's faster than the quadratic formula.</p>\n            \n            <h4>Example</h4>\n            <p>Factor x² + 7x + 12</p>\n            \n<p><strong>Step 1: Find two numbers that multiply to 12 and add to 7</strong><br>1 × 12 = 12, but 1 + 12 = 13 2 × 6 = 12, but 2 + 6 = 8 3 × 4 = 12, and 3 + 4 = 7</p>\n            \n<p><strong>Step 2: Write as (x + 3)(x + 4): STRATEGY TIP</strong><br>x² + 7x + 12 = (x + 3)(x + 4)<br>Always try factoring first! If it doesn't factor easily in 10 seconds, switch to the quadratic formula.</p>\n            \n            <h3>Example Problem</h3>\n            \n            <h4>Example 1</h4>\n            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>Factor: x² + 7x + 12: A. (x + 3)(x + 4)<br>B. (x + 2)(x + 6)<br>C. (x + 1)(x + 12)<br>D. (x − 3)(x − 4)</p>\n            \n<p><strong>Solution:</strong>Find two numbers that multiply to 12 and add to 7: 3 and 4.</p>\n            \n<p>x² + 7x + 12 = (x + 3)(x + 4)</p>\n            \n<p><strong>Answer: A</strong></p>\n            \n            <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>\n            <p>Try factoring first! If it doesn't factor easily, use the quadratic formula. Memorize the formula—it's not given on the ACT! Remember: quadratics usually have two solutions.</p>\n            </body></html>\n        ",
