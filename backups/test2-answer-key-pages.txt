ooo0  on   00  08  Passage  VI  When  viewed   from  Earth,  the  other  planets  in  the  solar  system  usually  appear  to  move  prograde  (eastward  relative  to  the  stars).  Occasionally,  however,   each  planet  appears  to  briefly  move  retrograde  (westward  relative  to  the  stars).  For   example,  Figure  |  shows  Mars’s  position  rel-  ative   to   the   stars   on   9   dat  February  26,  2006.  lates  between  July  24,  2005,  and  Key  *   star ©  Mars  7/24/2005  *   *  us  os  a  =  10/01/2005  —>~---9-~--  atte  ®  st  Rw:  <<  west  cast  —>  Figure   |  Two   hypotheses   were   proposed   to   explain   why   the  planets  occasionally  appear  to  move  retrograde.  Hypothesis  1  Earth  is  the  solar  system’s  central  body,  and  the  other  bodies  move  around  Earth  in  looped  orbits.  Each   body  (except   Earth)  has   2  circles  associated   with  it:  a  deferent  and   an  epicycle.  Both  circles   rotate  counterclockwise,  and  their  combined  motions  result  in  a  body  following  a  looped  orbit.  In  Figure  2,  the  left  panel  shows  Mars’s  deferent  and  epicycle,  and  the  right  panel  shows  Mars’s  orbit.  Marg  a  ff)  i  Mars  \  lepicycle  \O  !  \   Barth  /  \.  y  defereit  a  Figure   2  ACT-001,  48  As  a  body  passes  through  @  loop,  the  body's  motion  changes  from  prograde  to  retrograde  and  back.  The  larger  a  body's  deferent,  the  more  loops  in  the  body's  orbit,  and  the  more  often  that  body  passes  through  a  loop.  Hypothesis  2  The  Sun  is  the   solar  system's  central  body,  and  the  planets  move  counterclockwise  around  the  Sun  in  elliptical  orbits.  The  larger  a  planet's  orbit.  the  more  time  the   planet  takes  to  complete  a  revolution  around  the  Sun.  As  a  result,  the  line  of  sight  from  Earth  to  a  a  planet  drifts  over  time.  Figure  3  shows  the  orbits  of  arth  and  Mars,  and  the  positions  of  Earth  and  Mars,  on  each  of  the  4  dates  labeled  in  Figure  1,  For  each  date,  the  line  of  sight  from  Earth  to  Mars  is  projected  onto  a  view  of  the  sky.  There  are  2  rules   for  apparent  retrograde   motion:  ©  A  planet  with  an  orbit  larger  than  Earth's  appears  to  move  retrograde  whenever  Earth   passes  between  the  Sun  and  that  planet,  The  larger  that  planet's  orbit,  the  more  often   a   pass   occurs.  ©  A  planet  with  an  orbit  smaller   than  Earth's  appears  to  move  retrograde  whenever  that  planet  passes  between  the  Sun  and  Earth.  The  smaller  that  planet's  orbit,  the  more  often   a  pass  occurs.  Figure  3  GO   ON   TO   THE   NEXT   PAGE.

Explanation  of  Procedures  Used  to  Obtain  Scale  Scores   from  Raw  Scores  each  of  the  four  tests  on  Ore  ato  humber  of  corect  reer   tere  mite  ay  .  Use   the  table  below   to  convert   your  raw  scores  to  scale  s.  For  each  test,  locate  and  circle  your  raw  score  or  the  range  of  raw  scores  that  includes   it  in  the  table  below.  Then,  ead  across  to  either  outside  column  of  the   table   and  circle  the  scale  score  that  corresponds  to  that  raw  score.  As  you  determine   your  Scale  scores,  enter  them  in  the  blanks  provided  Oe  aoa  eeas  Possible  scale   score  for  each  testis  patron  SL  Score  for  any   test  on  which  you  scale  scores.  To  do  this,  add  your   four  scale  scores  and  divide  the  sum  by  4.  If  the  resulting  number  ends  in  a  fraction,  round  it  off  to  the  nearest  whole  number.  (Round  down  any  fraction  less  than  one-half;  round  up  any  fraction  that  is  one-half  or  more.)  Enter  this  number  in  the   blank.   This  is  your  Composite  score.  The  highest  possible   Composite  score  is  36.  The  lowest  possible  Composite  score  is  1.

If  any   test  was  completely  blank,  do  not  calculate  a  Composite  score.  —  Raw   Scores  |  Scale  Test  1  Test   2   Test  3  Ursaial  Soe  Score  English  Mathematics  Reading  Sei  |  36  73-75  58-60   39-40  39-40   36  35  70-72  56-57  38  =  Po  34   69  54-55  37  =  Ba  |  4  4  2.63  36  37   33  |  32  67  51  s   =   z  31  66  50  ae   35  30  pu  65  48-49  34  ke  Fs |  2  64  46-47  33   ee  2 x  62.63  44-45  32  s   a  |  be  61  41-43  31  =   =  |  26  59-60  38-40  a  aes  4  25  57-58  36-37  29  a  4  54-56  34-35  28  27-28   24  23  51-53   32-33   26-27  25-26  23  22  49-50   30-31   25  23-24  22  2  29  24  21-22  21  20  43-45  28   22-23  19-20  20  <  41-42  26-27  i  i  18  ie   40  24-25  20  16-17  18  a  38-39  21-23   18-19   14-15  v7  |  1  35.37  ed  Mu   te  ‘3 15   31-34   14-17   15-16   12   8 3050  14-13   14   10-11  as  |  14  tes  27-28  #10  bai  3  2  bes  24-26  7  a  ;  it  7  21-23  S  ei  H  10  :  21-28   :  A   6  10  10   4  7   i   :  16-17  9  are  3  6   *  : 8  o  Ms  3  H  7  11-12   2   4   3   6  4  9-10  =  3   2   :  ;  78  1  =   ~  s  ;  5-6  me  2  1  :  :   4  “a  1  rs  :  2  23  0  (e}  o  &  Fe   ~
