Vectors commonly are used to show motion, such as velocity and acceleration. Since vectors are not commonly taught in math class, many students are stumped when vectors appear on the ACT. In this lesson, we will teach you everything you need to know for vectors on the ACT!</p>\n<div class=\"diagram-box\" style=\"text-align: center; margin: 1.5rem 0; padding: 1rem; background-color: #f8faff;\">\n    <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Vector_from_A_to_B.svg/300px-Vector_from_A_to_B.svg.png\" alt=\"Vector representation\" style=\"max-width: 400px; height: auto;\" />\n    <p style=\"font-size: 0.9rem; color: #666; margin-top: 0.5rem;\">\n        <em>A vector has both magnitude (length) and direction</em>\n    </p>\n</div>\n\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">G) What is a Vector? A vector shows the magnitude and direction of a motion. Vectors are drawn as arrows on the coordinate plane. For example, if a car is driving at 30° east of north at 10 miles per hour, the vector would be:</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">_10</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">oh 307</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">hh</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">| -10</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The magnitude (length) of the vector is 10, which shows the speed that the car is traveling. If the car was driving at 20mph, the magnitude (length) of the vector would be 20. The direction is shown by the direction of</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">the vector, which is pointing 30° east of north.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Vectors on the ACT are most commonly written in the following forms:</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Standard form:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">v = Ai+ Bj</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Component Form:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">v = (A,B)</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">In standard form, Ai shows the x-component of the vector and Bj shows the y-component of the vector. In simpler terms, the A shows how far the vector goes left or nght and the B shows how far the vector goes up or down. In component form, the A shows the x-component and the B shows the y-component. The easiest way to teach this is with some examples. Let’s consider vectors X and Y below:</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Standard Form</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Vector X = 3i+4 Vector Y = —4i—2j</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Ct</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">RNw>oO</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">ens</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">/,</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">/</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Component Form</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">XxX</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">if</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Vector</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">X = (3,4)</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">i</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Vector Y = (—4,—2)</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">&NwOo</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">-5</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">When starting at the origin, a vector written in Ai + Bj or (A, B) notation ends at point (A, B). For vector X, we see the vector goes 3 units to the right and 4 units up and ends at the point (4,3). For vector Y, we see the vector goes 4 units to the left and 2 units down and ends at the point (—4, —2).</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 280</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Vectors</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Vector Addition and Subtraction The most common vectors question on the ACT is vector addition and subtraction. The good news 1s that vector addition and subtraction is simple! When given multiple vectors, all we do is combine like terms.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 1: What is the sum of vectors (2,5) and (—6, 8) ?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A. (8,13)</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B. (—4,13)</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C. (-8, —3)</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">G)</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D. (—4, 3)</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: To add vectors in component form, we combine like terms, so we add the A values, the x-components, and B values, the y-components, together.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">For the A values, we get: 2 + (—6) = —4</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">For the B values, we get.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5+ 8 = 13</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Combining our answers, we get (—4, 13). The answer is B. It’s simple arithmetic! The only way the ACT can make these questions slightly more difficult 1s by adding a coefficient, as shown in Example 2.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 2: The vectors A and B can be written as 5i — j and 12i — 4j respectively. If vector C is equal</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">to 2A — B, which of the following represents vector C ? A. 22i—6j</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">B. 10i-—2j</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">C. -2i+2j</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">D. 2i-—6j</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: When there is a coefficient in front of a vector, such as the 2 in 2A, we distribute the coefficient into in the vector.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">2A = 2(5i — J) = 10% — 2j</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Now that we know 2A, we can subtract B from 2A to find vector C:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">C = 2A—B = (10i — 2f) — (12i — 4) To solve, we distribute the negative sign and combine like terms. C= 10i —-2j—121+4j= —2i+ 2j The answer is C.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Vector Addition and Subtraction On A Graph For more advanced vectors questions, you need to know how to draw vector addition and subtraction on</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a graph using the tip-to-tail method. When adding or subtracting vectors, we will use the following steps:</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Start at the origin and draw the Ist vector. For example, if we have 3 vectors A, B, and C and are solving for A + B + C, we first draw vector A. The point where the first vector ends, where the top of the arrow is located, is called the tip. This will be our new starting point for drawing the next vector in the equation.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">For the 2nd vector, start at the tip of the 1st vector and draw the 2nd vector. The tail of the second vector (the straight part of the arrow) starts at the tip of the first arrow, hence the name tip-to-tail. For our example, we draw vector B and start from the tip of vector A.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Repeat this process for any additional vectors. For our example, we have so far done A + B. We still need to add vector C, so we start at the tail of vector B and draw vector C.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">4.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Draw a vector from the origin to the tip of the final vector in the equation. This vector</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">represents the final vector that you solved for. For our example, we draw a vector from the origin to the tip of vector C. The vector that we draw is the vector for A</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 281</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">+B+C.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Let’s go through an example to see how this works.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 3: For the vectors shown in the graph below, which of the following represents A + B —C?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.

Magnitude most commonly comes up on the ACT with questions involving velocity.

The magnitude of a vector is rarely tested on the ACT, but you should memorize the equation above just in case. The equation above is the same as the Pythagorean theorem. If you forget the equation on test day, you can draw the vector on the coordinate plane, make a triangle, and use the Pythagorean theorem to solve.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>",

The easiest way to do this is to find the x-value of the point on f(x) that is shifted to g(1). At g(1), the x-value is 1. To find the x-value of the point on f(x), we can reverse the shift and shift 2 unit right from</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x = 1tox = 3. So, we know the point that ends up at g(1) starts at f(3).

Let’s start with</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x? + y? = 16</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">This equation is a circle with its center at the origin and a radius of 4. Make sure that you remember that the</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">number represents r*. Many students forget this and mistakenly think the radius here is 16. The equation for a circle with a center at (A, k) and a radius r is</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(x—h)?+(y—k)* =r? We call this the standard form ofa circle. This is the equation that you need to memorize for test day, as questions using this form come up far more often. Again, let’s put some numbers in to make sure we understand how this works.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(x — 3)? +(v +5)? = 49</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">!</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(n=)</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">e</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">This equation is a circle with a center at (3, —5) and a radius of 7. Make sure that you notice the sign of the h and k values in the equation is the opposite of the actual coordinate of the center (h,k). The expression</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(x — 3)? shows the x-coordinate is at x = 3, not x = —3. The experssion (y + 5)? shows the y-coordinate is at y = —5 not</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">y= 5. A common mistake is to think the center of this circle is at (—3, 5).</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 195</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 1: A circle in the (x, y) coordinate plane has a center (—9, 4) and a radius of 6.

Since the center is at (—9, 4), we need to see the opposite signs of 4 and k, which here are +9 and —4 respectively, in the circle equation.

The answer is D.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">G) Advanced Circle Questions For more difficult circle questions, the ACT requires a deeper understanding of some basic principles of how circles work. While these principles may at times seem simple, recognizing these principles will be critical to solving more advanced circle questions. Principle #1: The two endpoints of any diameter on a circle have their midpoint at the center of</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">the circle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Try this on your own. Grab a piece of paper and drawa circle.

If you need to review how to use the midpoint formula, go back to Lesson. Principle #2: The distance between the center and any endpoint of a diameter of a circle is equal</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">to the radius of the circle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">If this principle seems obvious, it is because it is. It is just the definition of a radius! However, it is helpful to recognize if you are only given two endpoints of a diameter and are asked to find the equation of the circle.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 4: In the xy-plane, points (4,2) and (6,10) are the endpoints of a diameter on circle.

Sketching a coordinate plane, labeling the endpoints of the diameter, and drawing the circle can help you identify what steps you need</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">to take to solve the question.

Many textbooks switch a and b depending on the shape of the ellipse, but we will just think of a as the x-radius and b as the y-radius in this course to make this topic simpler to teach. When written in standard form, ellipses always have a + sign in the middle and are always equal to 1. Instead of having a diameter, ellipses have a major and minor axis. The major axis is the longer diameter of the ellipse, and the minor axis is the shorter diameter of the ellipse. It is important to remember that the lengths of the axes are equal to 2a and 2b.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">All of that probably seems very confusing to any of you who have not done ellipses before, so let’s go over this equation with some numbers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Evy</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">WV</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The center of this ellipse is at the origin.

These four points are called the vertices. The length of the major axis is 8 and the length of the minor axis is 4.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 5: Which of the following equations describes the ellipse shown in the standard (x, y)</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">coordinate plane below?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">:</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">‘</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">*</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">(|</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">—+—=1</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">16</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">36</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x2</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">y*</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">(4,</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">0)</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x*+y? = 36</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 198</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Circles, Ellipses, and Hyperbolas</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: The ellipse has its center at the origin.

The major axis is the longest diameter of the ellipse. The two focus points are equal distances from the center. On the ACT, you do not need to know how to find the foci, but you do need to know what they are and where they generally appear on an ellipse.

We know the foci are on the major axis, so the y-value of both points should be at y = 8.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Therefore, we know answer choices D and E are incorrect. Point (—2, 8) is the center, so A is incorrect. Points (—7, 8) and (3,8) are vertices, so B is incorrect.

In recent years, the ACT has been adding more questions with advanced topics, so we certainly expect hyperbolas to appear more frequently on future ACTs.

From the first equation, we know that 4A = lw, so plugging in the 44, we can find the new area in terms of A.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">New Area = 1.5(4A) = 6A The answer is D.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Method #2 — Substitution: If solving this question algebraically seems confusing, well that’s because it is! To make this question easier, use the substitution we learned in Lesson and pick values for the length and width of the original poster. Let’s say the length is 2 and the width is 3, so the original poster has an area of 6. Now, use the numbers we picked to solve the rest of the question.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">New Width = 3(3) =9</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">New Length = 2(0.5) = 1 New Area = lw = (9)(1) =9 The original area was 6 and the new area is 9. The new area is 1.5 times larger than the original area, so we</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">can apply that same change to the poster’s original area of 4A.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">New Area = 1.5(Original Area) = 1.5(4A) = 6A The answer is D.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Areas, Volumes, and Units The ACT loves to ask area or volume questions with various units. The most common are yards and feet or feet and inches. Students often answer these questions incorrectly because they make mistakes with unit conversion, even though the math is very simple. For example, let’s consider the following example:</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 4: A professional soccer field is 136 yards long and 93 yards wide. What is the area of a</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">professional soccer field in square feet?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">113,832</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B. 37,944</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">12,648</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">OD. 4,216</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: The key to solving these questions properly is convert the units BEFORE solving for the area</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">or volume. For Example 4, we should convert the length and width of the soccer field from yards to feet and then solve for the area.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">1 yard is 3 feet, so we can use that conversion to find the length and width in feet.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Length: 136 yards x 3 = 408 feet</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">-16</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Width: 93 yards x 3 = 279 feet</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Geometry Part 2 - Shapes</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">To find the area of the soccer field, we use the area of a rectangle equation and solve.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">A = lw = (408 ft)(279 ft) = 113,832 ft? The answer is A.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">You should memorize the unit conversions in bold below:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Yards and Feet</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Feet and Inches</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">1 yard = 3 feet</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">1 foot = 12 inches</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">1 square yard = 9 square feet</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">1 square foot = 144 square inches</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">1 cubic yard = 27 cubic feet</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">1 cubic foot = 1,728 cubic inches</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The ACT has commonly tested unit conversion questions on recent tests. When solving these questions, always convert units BEFORE solving for any area or volume. For more advanced questions, knowing the other conversion above can also be useful. The square yard, square feet, and square inches are used when finding area while the cubic yard, cubic feet, and cubic inches are for volume.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Volumes of Other Three-Dimensional Solids We already know how to find the volume of a rectangular prism (a box), a cube, and a right cylinder, but how do we find the volumes of other three-dimensional solids? The volume of any three-dimensional shape can be calculating using the equation V=Bxh</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">where B is the area of the base and h is the height. This equation is helpful for calculating the volume of a shape that is not one of the ones that we have already covered or is an odd shape that does not have a simple volume equation.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 5: Ming is building a sculpture out of wood. The base of the sculpture is shown below. If Ming</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">plans to make the sculpture 7 feet tall, what is the volume, in cubic feet, of the entire sculpture?</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Gap,</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">70</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">2ft</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">210</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">15 ft</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">280</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">|</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">|</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: First, we need to find the area of the base, which here is a trapezoid. Using the trapezoid area</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">formula, we find the area:</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The area of the base is 30 ft?. Now, we can use the volume equation and the height, which is 7 feet, to solve. V=Bxh= (30)(7) = 210 The answer is C.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">-17</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Right Triangles</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">All right triangles follow the Pythagorean Theorem:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a* + b* = ¢c* where a and b are the lengths of the legs and c is the hypotenuse. You can only use the Pythagorean Theorem equation for right triangles.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 6: In the triangle ABC, point D is the midpoint of AB, AC = 12 m, and BC = 15 m. To the</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">closest meter, what is the length of CD?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">14</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">13</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">9</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">15</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">coi</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">|</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">PD</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: To find the length of CD, we need to find the length of AD and use the Pythagorean theorem. To find AD, we need to first find AB using the Pythagorean theorem.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">127 + b* =15? > 144+ 5? = 225 > b* =81 b=9 AB = 9. Point D is the midpoint of AB, so we know that AD is half of AB. AD = 4.5. Now that we know</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">AD, we can use the Pythagorean theorem again to solve for CD.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">127+. 4.5% =c* > 1444+ 20.25 = c* > 164.25 = c? c= 12.82</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">CD = 12.82, which is closest to 13. The answer is B.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">TIP — Pythagorean Triples Pythagorean triples are sets of whole numbers that work in the Pythagorean theorem. On the ACT, you should look out for the two common Pythagorean triples. 3, 4, 5 Right Triangle</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">5, 12, 13 Right Triangle</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">|</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">13</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">12</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">4</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">These triangles can also be scaled up by multiplying all of the side lengths by the same number to create more Pythagorean triples. For example, a3, 4, 5 nght triangle can be doubled to become a 6, 8, 10 right triangle, tripled to become 9, 12, 15, and so on.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">-18</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Geometry Part 2 - Shapes</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Special Right Triangles You will need to be familiar with two special right triangles: 45° — 45° — 90° and 30° — 60° — 90°.

If your calculator does not have it, you will need to memorize the equation.

For these questions, we can answer the question “how many choices do I have” for each position where we need to select an item. To see how this works, let’s work through the examples below:</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 5: For his graduation dinner, Eric needs to select his outfit. If Eric has 6 dress shirts, 5</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">pairs of dress pants, 7 ties, and 3 pairs of shoes, how many different outfits could Eric put on?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">30</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B. 210</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C. 630</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1,260</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: This example is the simplest type of organized counting question. We recommend drawing</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">out a sketch with positions for each item as shown below:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Shirts</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Pants</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">=</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Ties</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Shoes</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Total Outfits</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">All we need to do now is put the number of choices in each position. Since Eric has 6 shirts, we put a 6 in the position for shirts. Since Eric has 5 pairs of pants, we put a 5 in the position from pants, and so on.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">6</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Shirts</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Pants</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">7</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Ties</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Shoes</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">=</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">630</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Total Outfits</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">To solve, multiply all the numbers together to find the total number of possibilities.

Easier versions of these questions appear in the middle of the test anywhere from questions 15-30 while more advanced ones appear in the last 15 questions. Use the “draw a diagram and label the spots” method that we used for these examples and solving these questions should be quick and easy!</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Advanced Combinations, Permutations, and Organized Counting Advanced combinations, permutations, and organized counting questions are some of the most difficult on the ACT Math Test, so this section is only for strong math students aiming for top ACT Math Scores.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">If you are not a strong math student, do not worry about mastering this section. There are a variety of ways the ACT can test you on these topics, so in the rest of this lesson we will cover the most common ways the ACT has tested these in the past. Understanding the following examples will give you the skills you need to handle these challenging questions 1n case you see them on test day.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Question Type #1 — Advanced Organized Counting</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 8: At the end of a men’s basketball game, all 5 players on the court high five each other player</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">and the coach. What was the total number of high fives given?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A. 36</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B. 25</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C. 21</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">15</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: We can solve this questions using combinations or organized counting. Both methods are shown, so you can find out which seems easier to you. Method #1 — Combinations: A high five takes a pair of people, so this question is actually just asking us to</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">find out how many pairs of 2 people can be selected from the 5 players and the coach. The order does not matter, so we use a combination. We have 6 total people, son = 6, and need to select 2, so r = 2.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The answer is D. If that seems confusing or you do not feel confident with combinations, you may prefer using method #2. Method #2 — Organized Counting: The key to solving this question is to have an organized approach and to recognize the pattern to save time. To make this simpler, let’s call the players A, B, C, D, E. Now, let’s consider the first player A. To high five the 4 other players and the coach, player A must make 5 high fives. We can show the high fives as © to give a visual as well.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">ASPB</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">ASC</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A&D</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A&E</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">A#& Coach</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Total High Fives</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">= 5</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Now, let’s consider player B. Player B has already high fived player A, so he only needs to high five players C, D, and E and the coach. Bec</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">BeD</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">BeE_</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Be Coach</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Total High Fives = 5 + 4</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">What about player C? Well, player C has already high fived players A and B, so he only needs to high five placed D and E and the coach. CeD</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">CeE</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Ce# Coach</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Total High Fives=5+4+3</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Player D has already high fived players A, B, and C, so he only needs to high five player E and the coach. DeE</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C#</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Coach</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Total High Fives=5+4+3+2</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 225</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Player E has already high fived players A, B, C, and D, so he only needs to high five the coach. E © Coach</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Total High Fives</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">=5+44+3+4+2+4+1</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Everyone has already high fived the coach, so we are done. Total High Fives</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">=5+4+34+2+4+1=15</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The answer is D. You likely recognized the pattern pretty quickly, so these questions can be solved pretty</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">quickly with this method. The organized counting method and pattern can appear in any similar questions where we are being asked about the various ways to count events that involve making pairs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Question Type #2 — Advanced Combinations and Counting Multiple Outcomes</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 9: There are 12 donuts in a box in the break room. 7 of the donuts are glazed, 3 are chocolate,</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">and 2 are cinnamon sugar.

The big mistake most students make is only counting one of these outcomes. For the outcome #1, we need to find the probability of first getting a</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">chocolate donut and then getting a cinnamon sugar donut:</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Probability (Outcome #1) = P(Chocolate) x P(Cinnamon Sugar) = — x</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">12°11</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">6</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">132</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">For outcome #2, we need to find the probability of first getting a cinnamon sugar donut and then getting a</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">chocolate donut:</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Probability (Outcome #2) = P(Cinnamon Sugar) x P(Chocolate) = D x Ti</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">6</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">132</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">To get our final answer, we add the probabilities of both outcomes and simplify:</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">6</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">6</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">12</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">732132132,</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">11</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The correct answer is A. Anytime you see a question like this asking you to find the probability of a specific event, make sure that you remember that various orders can lead to the desired outcome and, to solve correctly, you may need to solve for the probabilities of multiple outcomes.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 226</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Factorial, Permutations, Combinations, and Organized Counting</h3>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>",

Here, we have the absolute value bars on the left side of the equation, so we will move all constants outside of the absolute value bars to the right side. We start with any constants outside of the absolute value bars that can be added or subtracted, which in this case 1s the —6. 3|2x+1]|-—6=45 To move the —6 to the right side, we add 6 to both sides. 3|2x +1] =51 Next, we must move the 3 to the night side. We can do this by dividing both sides by 3 to get |2x+1|=17 Now that the absolute value bars are on one side and the constants are on the other, we can solve by setting the term inside the absolute value bar equal to +17 and —17 and solving both equations. 2x+1=17</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">2x+1=-17</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">2x = 16</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">2x</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">= —18</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x=8</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x=-9</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We getx = 8 and x = —9, so the answer is D.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 173</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Absolute Value and Inequalities Absolute value with inequalities questions are the most difficult type of absolute value question you will face on the ACT. Whenever solving these questions, the solution is an interval. To see how this works, let’s start</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">with a simple example:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Ix] <3 We need to find all x-values that are less than 3 units away from zero in either direction. On a number line, this is all points that are less than +3 and greater than —3.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">0</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">—3</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">o</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The solution would be the interval —3 < x < 3. We do not include +3 or —3 because they are exactly 3 units from zero and not less than 3 units from zero. What if instead we had</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Ix] =>3 Now, we need to find all x-values that are greater than or equal to 3 units from zero in either direction. Ona number line, this is all points that are less than or equal to —3 and greater than or equal to +3.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"><</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">¢</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">|</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">—3</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">0</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">> x</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The solution would be the interval x < —3 and x = 3. Here, we include the +3 and —3 because they are exactly 3 units from zero. For any questions with an unknown in the absolute value bars and an inequality, the solution is an</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">interval. There are 4 steps to solve these questions.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Move all terms outside of the absolute value bars to the right side of the equation. For example,</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">given |x + 3| — 2 < 5, we need to add 2 to both sides to get |x + 3] < 7</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Determine where on a number line the inequality is true. For |x + 3| < 7, the value in the absolute value bars, x + 3, must be greater than —7 and less than +7.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Set the expression inside the absolute value bar in an inequality equation(s). For |x| < a or |x| < a, set up the equation as —a</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\"><x <aor—-—a<x <a. For |x| > aor |x| = 4, set up the</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">equation as x < —aand x > aorx < —aand x =a. For |x + 3| < 7, we set up our inequality equations as -7</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">4.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\"><x +3 <7.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solve the equations to get the intervals for the unknown variable. For —7 < x + 3 < 7, we solve by subtracting 3 from all terms.

Let’s say the first litter has an average weight of 1 pound (p = 1) and the second litter has an average weight</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">of 3 pounds (m = 3). We can use our numbers to solve for the average weight of the puppies in both litters. Total Weight of 1st Litter = 7 x 1=7</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The first litter had 7 puppies with an average weight of 1 pound, so the total weight of the litter is 7 pounds. Total Weight of 2nd Litter</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">=5 x 3 = 15</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The second litter had 5 puppies with an average weight of 3 pounds, so the total weight is 15 pounds. Now, we can find the average weight of each puppy from these two litters.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">_ 7#15 22</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">12</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">«11</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">12</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">«6</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">With our values of p = 1 and m = 3, we found that w = = To find the correct answer choice, plug in our</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">11</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">values of p = 1 and m = 3 to the answer choices and see which one gives you w = =: Below, you can see how the correct answer choice C gives us the correct value for w. w= 7(4)+5(3) _ 22 _ 11</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">12</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The answer is C.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 103</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">12</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">6</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 4: During the first 30 minutes of work at Birkee’s Bakery, Vaivani decorated 23 cookies per</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">minute for the first 10 minutes and then at 14 cookies per minute for the next 20 minutes.

Since the first average of 23 cookies per minute is for 10 minutes and the second average of 14 cookies per minute is for 20 minutes, these averages cannot be treated equally. In math, this is called a weighted average. To solve</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">weighted average questions with two items, we can use the equation below:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Weighted Average =</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(average #1)(weight #1) + (average #2)(weight #2) weight #1 + weight #2</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">In this equation, the two averages are the given averages, so we plug in 23 for average #1 and 14 for average #2. The weight refers to the significance of the data point. Exactly what the weight is will depend on the question. For Example 4, the weight is the number of minutes, with 10 being weight #1 and 20 being weight #2. If there was a question where we were trying to calculate your final grade and 70% of your grade was from homework and 30% was from tests, the percentages of 70 and 30 would be the weights. The weights are</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">used to reflect that certain averages have more “weight,” or more significance, than others.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Now, let’s get back to Example 4 and use the weighted average formula to solve:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Average Number of Cookies =</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">(23)(10)+(14)(20) __</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">10+20</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">7</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">17</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The answer is D.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The weighted average formula is a very important one and can be used to solve many ACT average questions. Looking back to Example 2, we can use a weighted average to solve. In that question, the averages are given as 85 for the first class and 90 for the second class. The weight is the number of students in each class, which is 6 and 9. Average Score =</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">(85)(6)+(90)(9) _ 38</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">6+9</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We even could use the weighted average formula for Example 3. The averages are given to be p and m. The weight is the number of puppies in each litter, which is 7 and 5. (p)(7)+(m) (5) _ 7p+5m</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Average Puppy Weight =</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">74+5</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">12</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Make sure that you understand how the weighted average formula works.

Ifa</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">new family moves in with a household income of $1,859,000, which of the following values for the</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">neighborhood will most likely change the least?

In statistics, we call values that are far higher or lower than any other numbers in the data set outliers. Any outlier will greatly increase the range and maximum value. The new family’s income is also so large that it will increase the mean household income for the neighborhood. The median will change the least. Since the median is the middle value in a data set, any outliers always have a minimal effect on the median. The answer is B.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 7: For her science fair experiment, Monica wanted to find out if her tree frog or bullfrog has the</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">bigger jump.

For these questions, we will need to use a more efficient method than listing all the values and crossing off to find the median value.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 8: The school newspaper recently surveyed 51 students about their monthly consumption of</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">cheeseburgers.

To</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">find the median term, there are three quick steps:</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Add 1 to the total number of items in the data set.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Divide that number by 2.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">e</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">If we have a data set with an odd number of items, the number we get is the term that is the median.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">e</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">If we have a data set with an even number of items, we will get an answer that ends in 0.5. In this case, the median is the average of the two middle terms. The two middle terms are the integers right above and below the value that we get from our first two steps. For example, if we have a group of 20, we would get 10.5 in step 2. This tell us that two middle terms will be the 10th and 11th terms. We find the median by finding the average of the 10th and 11th terms.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Find where the term is in the table.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">In this question, we have 51 students who were surveyed, so following Step 1 above</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">51+1</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">= 26</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">we find the 26th student will be the median data point in the set. To find where the 26th student is in the table, start at the top of the table and simply add up the students until you find the 26th student. Here, there are 7 students who ate 0 burgers and 19 who ate 1 burger. If we add 7 and 19 together, we get 26, so we can tell that the 26th student ate 1 burger. As a result, the median is 1 and the answer is B.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 106</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Mean, Median, Mode, and Range</h3>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>",

The imaginary unit is defined as</p>\n<div class=\"diagram-box\" style=\"text-align: center; margin: 1.5rem 0; padding: 1rem; background-color: #f8faff;\">\n    <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/A_plus_bi.svg\" alt=\"Complex plane\" style=\"max-width: 400px; height: auto;\" />\n    <p style=\"font-size: 0.9rem; color: #666; margin-top: 0.5rem;\">\n        <em>The complex plane: real numbers on the x-axis, imaginary numbers on the y-axis</em>\n    </p>\n</div>\n\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">i=vV-1 Since part of complex numbers are “imaginary,” it is difficult to grasp how they work. But do not worry, you only need to learn a few methods for how to handle complex numbers when they appear on the ACT.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Adding and Subtracting Complex Numbers For addition and subtraction with complex numbers, we combine like terms. For example,</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(84+ 5i) + (5 —2i) = 134+ 3i Simple right? For subtraction questions, always make sure that you distribute the negative sign to both terms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(2-31) -(5-7) =2-3i1-5+7i=-3+4i Many students make the mistake of forgetting to distribute the negative sign and get an answer of —3 — 10i. Be careful because the ACT will have this common mistake as an incorrect answer choice.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 1: What is the difference of complex numbers 22 — 14i and 7 — 3i ?</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">A. 15-17i</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">B.15-11i</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">CC. -15+11i</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">D. 29-17i</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Solution: Set up the equation and combine like terms.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(22 —14i) — (7 — 3i) = 22 -141-—-7 + 3i=15-11i The answer is B.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Multiplying Complex Numbers Before we go into the details of how to multiply complex numbers, you need to know that</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">i=-1 Multiplying complex numbers is just like multiplying binomials: use FOIL, which stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last. For example,</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(3 — 5i)(2 — 21) = 6 — 6i — 10i + 1072 = 6 — 161 + 107?</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We are not done yet. Since there is an i? term when we multiply complex numbers and i? = —1, we must plug in —1 for i?. 6 — 16i + 10(—1) Combining the numbers, we get the answer of —4—-16i</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 2: What is the product of complex numbers 1 — 3i and 11 + 2i ?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">11-6i</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">12 -i</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">11</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">— 38i</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">17 —31i</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Solution: Multiply the two imaginary numbers together and combine like terms.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(1 — 3i)(11 + 2i) = 11 + 2i — 333i — 6i7 = 11 — 31i — 6i?

The complex conjugate is a complex number with an identical real part and an imaginary part with the opposite sign. In algebra terms, a+ bi and a — bi are complex conjugates. If you prefer numbers, 2 + 3i and 2 — 3i are complex conjugates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">To find the complex conjugate of any complex number, switch the sign of the imaginary part. So why does this matter? The complex conjugate is important because the product of any complex number and its complex conjugate is a real number.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(a + bi)(a — bi) = a* + b* With numbers, we can see how the imaginary terms cancel out and we just get numbers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(2+ 3i)(2-—3i) = 4-6i1+ 6i- 917 = 4-917 = 4-—9(-1) = 13</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Notice that 27 + 3% = 13, so we can skip all that math if we memorize the shortcut for the product of complex conjugates. Complex conjugates are most often used when complex numbers are fractions with the imaginary part in the denominator. Fractions are not allowed to have the i in the denominator. To fix this problem, we can multiply the top and bottom of the fraction by the complex conjugate. For example, if we are given</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">10</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">1—-2i</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">we need to multiply the top and bottom of the fraction by the complex conjugate, which here is 1 + 2i.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">10</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">142i</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">- xX</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">;</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">1-2i</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">142i</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We get 10 + 20i</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We can now simplify and get 2+ 4i</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 3: Which of the following is equivalent to the equation below?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">4,</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">A. =+=i</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5,</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">4</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">=—-i</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">15</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">20.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">7</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">7</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">4</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">C.=—-=i</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">4</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">D.=-=i</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: To simplify, multiply the top and bottom of the fraction by the complex conjugate of 3 + 41.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">3-4it</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">ott 344i</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We get</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">15 + 20i</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">25</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 239</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We can now split the fraction and simplify to get</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">re,</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">cl</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The answer is A.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">TIP — Use Your Calculator If you calculator has an i button, you can type most complex numbers questions into your calculator, and it will tell you the answer. You do not need to do any math! For those of you with a TI-83, TI-84 TI-Nspire (non CAS), and many Casio calculators, you can enter complex numbers in your calculator! If you have a different type of calculator, it is worth looking up if you have an i button. To see how this trick works, go back to Examples 1—3 that we just solved and plug them into your calculator. When you press ENTER, the calculator will show you the correct answer!</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The Powers of i You should memorize the following pattern of i powers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">ji=i i</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2— —1</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">3 = —t</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">i*=1 Knowing this pattern will be essential to solving certain imaginary numbers questions that ask you to solve for</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a higher power of i, such as i1°?. The method for solving these questions is covered in Lesson on p. 192, so you can go to that chapter to learn how to solve questions with higher powers of i.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">For most students, that is all that you need to know about complex numbers! The ACT will also rarely include questions that involve the complex plane, which we will discuss next. Since</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">it is very rarely tested, the complex plane can be skipped for students on a time crunch to get ready for the ACT. In general, it is only important for students aiming for top math scores who want to know everything</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">that can be on the ACT.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 240</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Complex Numbers</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Advanced Complex Number Topics The following advanced complex number topics are rarely tested on the ACT. If these topics do appear on the test, they are usually later in questions 35-45. The good news is these questions are usually pretty easy to solve as long as you know the rules that you will learn in the rest of this lesson.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The Complex Plane The complex plane is a way to represent complex numbers on a coordinate plane. The complex plane works</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">just like the standard (x, y) coordinate plane, except that now the x-axis is “real” and the y-axis is</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">“imaginary.” For graphing complex numbers, you need to know the following rule:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Any complex number a + bi is graphed on the complex plane at point (a, b).

This makes sense because the complex number has a value of 3 for the real number, which is on the x-axis, and a value of 4 for the imaginary number, which is on the y-axis. For the</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">same reasoning, 1 — 3i is at (1, —-3) and —1 + 2i is at (—1, 2).</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 4: When graphed in the complex plane, the sum of complex numbers —2 + 4i and —3 — 2i</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">appears in which quadrant?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">I</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B.

The triangle will have a base of 3 anda</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">height of 4 and 32 + 4? = 52, which tells the distance from the origin is 5.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 24]</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 5: |7 — 4i| =?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.3</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">B. vV33.

Questions like this appear quite often on the ACT, and they seem almost impossible to solve at first glance. However, once you learn the trick to solving repeating patterns questions, they are actually easy!</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Repeating Decimals The first and easiest type of repeating patterns question is one with a repeating decimal. Remember, a line above a decimal shows the decimal repeats over and over again without ending. For example,</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">0.1234 = 0.1234123412341234 ...</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">As you will see in the following example, we can use the repeating pattern to find values that occur way later</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">in the decimal without actually writing it out.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 1: What is the 307th place after the decimal point in the repeating decimal 0.34562 ?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B. 3</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C. 4</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: The trick to solving repeating decimals questions is using the repeating pattern to our advantage. To show you how this works, let’s write out the decimal in repeating form.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">0.34562 = 0.345623456234562 ...</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We want to go to the end of the repeating unit, which here is the 2. Since the pattern repeats every 5 places, every 5th place after the decimal point will be a 2.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">0.34562 = 0.345623456234562 ...</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Sth</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">ee = 10th_=—</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">15th</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The 5th place, the 10th place, the 15th place are all 2. As the repeating decimal continues, every digit that is a multiple of 5 will be a2. 25 places, 50 places, 500 places...all of these will be 2.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We are looking for the 307\" place after the decimal point. To find that value, we need to find a multiple of 5 near 307. The closest multiple of 5 is 305, which will be a2. Once we know that the 305th place is a 2, we</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">can count forward in our sequence. The 306th digit is a 3, and the 307th digit is a4. The answer is C.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 2: What is the 703rd place after the decimal point in the repeating decimal 0.596127 ?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B. 5</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C. 6</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D. 9</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: Let’s use the same trick we just learned in Example 1. Here, we have 6 digits repeating. We go to the end of the repeating unit, which here is a 7.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">0.596127 = 0.596127596127 ...</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">'</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">4</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">6th</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">12th</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Every number that is a multiple of 6 after the decimal point will be a 7. We are looking for the 703rd place after the decimal point. To find that value, we need to find a multiple of 6 near 703. The closest multiple is 702, which is</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a7. Once we know the 702nd place is a 7, we can count forward in the sequence. The 703rd</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">term is 5. The answer is B.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 189</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Repeating Patters with Powers and the Units Digit What is the units digit of 7123? This is an example of second and more difficult type of repeating patterns question. Before we learn how to solve these questions, let’s make sure that you know what the units digit refers to.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The units digit of a number is the digit in the one’s place. For example, the units digit in 945 is 5, and the units digit of 10,381 is 1. Now that we know what the units digit (or one’s place) is, let’s get back to learning how to solve repeating powers questions that ask about the units digit.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 3: What is the units digit of 7/22 ?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B. 3</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C. 7</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D. 9</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: If we try to enter this into the calculator, most calculators will either give us an error or will show us a number in scientific notation. Either way, we cannot see the number in the units digit, so we need to take</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">another approach. To solve, we need to identify the repeating pattern as the exponent increases. Take a look at the powers of 7 written below and see if you can spot the pattern.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">71 =7</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">7° = 16,807</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">77 = 49</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">7° = 117,649</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">7? = 243</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">77 = 823,543</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">7* = 2,401</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">7® = 5,764,801</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">As the powers increase, we see a repeating pattern with the units digit. The units digits above are in the pattern</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">7,9, 3,1, 7,9, 3, 1...</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The units digits repeat in the pattern of 7, 9,3, 1 over and over again as the powers increase. Now that we see</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">the pattern, we can use the same technique we did with repeating decimals: go to the end of the repeating unit.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">7,9, 3,1,7,9,3, 1...</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">tof</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Ath</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Sth</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The 4th power and the 8th power have a units digit of 1. As the repeating pattern continues, all powers that are</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a multiple of 4 will have a units digit of 1. 71%, 74°, 749° will all have a units digit of 1.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We are looking for 7127, so we need to find out what number is the 122nd term in the pattern. To do this, we want to see if 122 1s a multiple of 4 and, if it is not, find the closest multiple of 4 near 122.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">122 is nota</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">multiple of 4, and the closest multiple of 4 is 120. This tells us that 72° has a 1 in the units digit. Counting forward in the pattern, 712+ has a7</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">in the units digit and 7122 has a 9 in the units digit. The answer</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">is D.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 190</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Repeating Patterns</h3>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 4: 3% has a9 in the ones place.

The units above follow the pattern</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3,9, 7, 1,3, 9, 7, 1...</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The pattern of 3, 9, 7, 1 repeats over and over again as the powers increase. In this question, 3* has a 9 in the ones place. The easiest method to find out what digit is in the ones place of</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">3*+3 is to pick a value for x and use the pattern above. Since 3* = 9, we can use x = 2. This works because the 9 is in the ones place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Now, we need to find out what 3**? has in the ones place. Since we picked x = 2, 3**? becomes 3°. 3° = 243, so there is a 3 in the ones place. The answer is B. We could have picked any value of x that made 3% have a 9 in the ones place. Since 3° = 729, we could have used x = 6 and solved from there. 3%*? becomes 3?. 3? = 19,683, which has a 3 in the ones place. The term 3**3 is telling us to go 3 terms forward in the repeating pattern. If we start at any term that has a 9 in the units digit and count 3 terms forward, we will always get to a term with a 3 in the units digit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Commonly Tested Repeating Patterns with Powers and the Units Digit There are a variety of numbers that have a repeating pattern in the units digit as the power increases.

For those of you who have not learned</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">about complex numbers yet, this will be covered in Lesson. All you need to know for now is that i =~v-—1.

You should memorize this pattern. Since the pattern is every 4 terms, we will use the same method we just used with</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">repeating powers.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 5: 10i*” — 7 is equal to:</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">—10i-—7</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">10i + 7</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">C. 3i</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D. 3</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: To solve, we need to find out what i*° is equal to.

Now that we know i*” = —i, we can plug in —i for i*” and solve. 10i47 —7 =10(-i) —7 = —10i —7 The answer is A.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 6: If k is a multiple of 4, i***+ equals:</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">B. t</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">C. -i</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D. -1</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: The easiest way to solve this question is to pick a value for k.

For repeating decimals, this should be easy. For repeating powers, you will need to have the pattern memorized or write out the powers until you see the pattern repeat. Find the number of items in the repeating unit. For example, 0.235638 has 6 items. All of the powers and i examples had 4 items.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Go to the end of the repeating unit. In 0.235638, the end of the repeating unit is the 8. In the powers patterns, the end of the repeating unit is the 4th term. This is the value of the term we will find in step 4. Find a multiple of the number of items in the repeating unit (step 2) closest to the target number.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">For example, if you want to find the 103rd number after the decimal point in 0.235638, find a multiple of 6 near 103. The closest one is 102. The 102nd term is an 8.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Count forwards or backwards in the repeating pattern to find target term. In 0.235638, the 102nd term is 8 and the 103rd term is 2.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>",

There is a wide range of Statistics topics that are included on the ACT, all of which we will cover in this lesson. Most students have learned minimal or no statistics in math class, so these topics usually challenge students simply because they do not know the rules or definitions. If you memorize all the rules and definitions in this lesson, you will be prepared for any statistics questions on the ACT.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Description of A Survey Imagine we want to find how many pairs of shoes students the average student at a high school owns. To find out, we would conduct a survey where we ask a population of students at the school how many pairs of shoes they own. For this example, let’s say there are 500 students at a high school. In statistics, there are a variety of methods of surveying that you need to be familiar with. The common definitions, along with an example for how we would apply it to our pair shoes survey, are listed below. e</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Census: A survey that includes every member of the population. If we conduct a census for our example, we survey all 500 students at the high school. This method would find the true value for the average number of pairs of shoes students at the high school own.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">e</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Sample Survey: A survey that includes a selected subset (smaller group) of the population. If we conduct a sample survey for our example, we survey a small group of students, say 50 students, and would use their answers to make an estimate about the average number of pairs of shoes each student at the high school owns. We would not be able to find the true value — only an estimate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">e</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Randomized: Participants are randomly selected from the group. A randomized study/survey</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">produces reliable results. An example of a randomized survey would be if we randomly selected 50 students at the high school and asked them how many pairs of shoes they own. This would give us an estimate for the average number of pairs of shoes each student at the high school owns. e</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Non-randomized: Participants are not randomly selected from the group. A nonrandomized</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">study/survey can lead to biased results. An example of a nonrandomized survey would be if we ask the first 50 students who arrive at school how many pairs of shoes they own. This may produce a biased (inaccurate) result because we do not get a random sample of the entire population (all 500 students). For example, if the football team has practice before school, the first 50 students to show up might all be boys who are football players. The average number of pairs of shoes the 50 football players own is not likely representative of how many shoes on average the rest of the students at the high school own.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">If you understand these descriptions of a survey, you should be prepared for any questions related to this on test day.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 1: Sarah wants to get an estimate of how many seniors plan on attending a 4-year college on the</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">East Coast after graduation. To do so, Sarah plans to ask all the seniors who have lunch during fifth period and record their responses. Seniors who have lunch during other periods were NOT included in the study. Which of the following phrases describes Sarah’s method?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Nonrandomized census</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Randomized census</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Nonrandomized sample survey</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Randomized sample survey</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: Sarah is only surveying students who have lunch in fifth period, so she is not conducting a census. A census would be surveying all seniors at the school. The seniors included in her survey are only the ones who have lunch in fifth period, so she is getting a nonrandomized selection. A randomized</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 292</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Statistics</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">selection would use a method, such as picking names from a hat, to randomly select a group of seniors from all seniors at her school. Sarah is asking a subset (small group) of seniors from the entire population, so she is conducting a survey. In an experiment, the person conducting the experiment is manipulating a variable to find out how it influences the results. Sarah is not conducting an experiment. The answer is C.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Shapes of Distributions After collecting data in a survey or census, data points are commonly presented in a graph to show how the points are distributed in the set. When the data points are graphed, we can see the shape of the distribution. There are 5 common distribution patterns you need to know for the ACT. The shape of the distribution is described by its number of peaks, the possession of symmetry, its tendency to skew, or its uniformity. Each distribution is show below. Normal Distribution</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">e</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Symmetric bell shape with one</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Uniform Distribution</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">e</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">e</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Two modes (peaks) in the data</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">©</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Example: Number of people at</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">outcomes</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">peak e</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Equal probability for all</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Bimodal Distribution</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Mean and median are equal;</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">e</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Example: Roll a fair dice 200</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">set</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">both are located at the center of</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">times and record the results.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a restaurant at different hours.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">the distribution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">All number on the dice have</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The two peaks would be during</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">an equal probability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">lunch and dinner.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">e Example: Ask the heights of</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">1,000 randomly selected men.

Most students receive higher</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">e</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">scores while fewer have lower scores.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Example: Ask the salary of 500 randomly selected adults. More people have lower and medium salaries while fewer have high salaries.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 293</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 2: A computer program that randomly selects an integer between 1 and 20 will be run 8,000</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">times. Each time a number is selected, the number will be recorded. Which of the following will most likely characterize the distribution of the 8,000 recorded numbers?</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">A. Normal</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">B. Uniform</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">C. Skewed left</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">D. Skewed right</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: Since the computer program is randomly selecting integers, the probability for each integer being selected is the equal. If we plot the results, we expect to see a uniform distribution. The answer is B.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Standard Deviation Standard deviation is a measure of the spread of values in a data set. A low standard deviation indicates the numbers tend to be closer to the average of a data set while a high standard deviation indicates that numbers tend to be farther from the average of a data set. You do not need to know how to compute standard deviation on the ACT, but you do need to understand the concept. All that you need to know is: A set of numbers that is closer together has a lower standard deviation, and a set of numbers that is farther apart has a higher standard deviation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">All you need to do to correctly answer standard deviation questions correct is memorize this rule. Let’s take a look at two examples to see how this might come up on test day.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 3:</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Company A:</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">18, 25, 26, 26, 27, 35, 36, 38</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Company B: 64, 66, 66, 66, 68, 68, 68, 70</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Company C: 22, 40, 78, 78, 88, 90, 90, 96</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Three water filtration companies (A, B, and C) each provided 8 samples of water to be tested for purity. The purity scores are listed above. Which of the following statements about the standard deviation of the purity scores is correct?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Company A has the lowest standard deviation.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Company B has the lowest standard deviation.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Company C has the lowest standard deviation.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">It cannot be determined which company has the lowest standard deviation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: To find out which company has the lowest standard deviation, we look for which set of numbers is the closest together. The purity scores for Company B are the closest together, so company B has the lowest standard deviation. The answer is B. Notice that the actual values of the numbers do not affect standard deviation. It does not matter how big or small the numbers are; all that matters is how close the numbers are to each other.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 294</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Statistics</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Standard deviation questions can also include a table or graph. If we are given a table or graph, we are still looking for how spread apart the data points are. Data points that are more closely clustered have a lower standard deviation while data points that are more spread apart have a higher standard deviation.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 4: The table below give the distribution of weekly rainfall for City A and City B over 17</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">weeks during the summer of 2021.

The values for the weekly rainfall for city A are very spread out, with 6 weeks having less than 1 inch of rainfall and 5 weeks having greater than 4 inches of rainfall. City B has very consistent rainfall, with 11 of the 17 weeks falling between | and 1.99 inches, so the weekly rainfall is not very spread out. City A is much more spread out than city B, so the standard deviation of weekly rainfall in city A is greater. The answer is A.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Stem and Leaf Plot A stem and leaf plot is a method for presenting data in a simple visual form. Data points are split into a</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">“stem,” the first digit(s), and a “leaf,” the last digit. Stem and leaf plots provide a visual way to represent large data sets and make it easier to observe the frequencies of different events. To show you how this works, let’s consider a family reunion with 14 people in attendance. The ages of</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">everyone at the family reunion are listed below:</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">17, 21, 24, 25, 30, 41, 45, 45, 48, 49, 54, 61, 77, 79</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">A stem and leaf plot for the data is shown below. Stem | Leaf</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1 | 7</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2/1,4,5</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3 | 0</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">4/</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1,5,5,8,9</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5 | 4</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">6]</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">7 | 7,9</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The stem and leaf plot shows all the ages. Remember, the “stem” is the first digit, and the leaf is the last digit. Starting at the top of plot, the stem of 1 and leaf of 7 represents the 17 in the data set. Moving down, the stem of 2 has leaf values of 1, 4, and 5, which represents the 21, 24, and 25 in the data set respectively. The 3 and 0 represents the 30, and so on.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 295</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">As we can see, the stem and leaf plot provides a visual representation of the data and makes it easier to observe the frequencies of the different ages. From the plot, we can clearly see that the highest concentration of people at the family reunion are in their 40s. There is one more important thing to know for stem and leaf plots: the number of leaves is equal to the total</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">number of data points. In our example above, there are a total of 14 leaves to represent the ages of the 14 people in attendance at the family reunion.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 5: The stem and leaf plot below shows the heights of 26 lemon trees at Greener Pastures</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Nursery.

The question tells us there are 26 lemon trees, so we know the total number of lemon trees. If the question did not tell us the total number of lemon trees, we would count the total number of leaves in the stem and leaf plot to find the total. The lemon trees that have a height less than 50 inches are all ones with a stem of 3 and 4. For the stem of 3, the 4 leaves show the heights of 4 lemons trees to be 33, 33, 35, and 39 inches. For the stem of 4, the 7 leaves show the heights of 7 lemon trees to be 40, 41, 43, 46, 46, 48, and 49 inches. Therefore, there are a total of 11 trees with a height less than 50 inches. Now, we can find the probability. Lemon Trees With Height Less Than 50 Inches _ 11</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Total Lemon Trees</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">~ 26</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The answer is B.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Sample Proportion The sample proportion (p) describes the proportion of individuals in a sample with a certain characteristic or trait. To find the sample proportion, we divide the number of individuals who have a certain characteristic or trait by the total number of individuals in the sample. You can think of the sample proportion as the probability of a certain trait appearing in a randomly selected individual in the sample. Just like probability, sample proportion can be expressed as a fraction or a decimal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">To see how this works, let’s look at an example of how this can appear on the ACT.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 6: DKMC Fine Woodworking is doing a quality control test on its popular new coffee tables.</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">To conduct the test, the workers selected a random sample of 120 coffee tables out of the 1,000 tables they built in 2022 to inspect and identified 9 of the tables had a poor stability. Let p be the proportion of coffee</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">tables with a poor stability. What is p, the sample proportion, for this sample?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A. 0.0075</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B. 0.009</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C. 0.075</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D. 0.09</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 296</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Statistics</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: The sample proportion is the number of tables with poor stability, 9, out of the entire sample, 120.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">You can see how this is set up below:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Tables with poor stability</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">9</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Pp ~ Total tables in the sample 120 = 0.075 The total number of tables built in 2022 is irrelevant to finding the sample proportion. The answer is C.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Box and Whisker Plot A box and whisker plot is another way that a data set can be visually displayed. The box and whisker plot gives a five-number summary of the data: the minimum, the maximum, the first quartile, the median, and the third quartile.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">20</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">e</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">50</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">80</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">110</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">140</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">170</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The whiskers display the minimum and maximum of the data. For the example plot, the minimum is at 30 and the maximum is at 160.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">e</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The box ranges from the first quartile (25 percentile) to the third quartile (75\" percentile) of the data. In other words, the middle 50% of the data points, those from the 25\" to 75\" percentiles, all fall within the box. The first quartile, the lowest 25% of data points, is from the minimum to the left</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">edge of the box. The fourth quartile, the largest 25% of data points, is from the right side of the box to the maximum. e</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The middle line in the box displays the median for the data. For the example plot, the median is</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">110.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">e</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">§=©The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile. The</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">width of the box shows IQR. The IQR is equal to the value for the right side of the box (the third quartile) minus the value for the left side of the box (the first quartile). For the example plot, the third quartile is 130 and the first quartile is 80, so the IQR is 50 (130 — 80 = 50).</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 7: Ms. Pearson’s first and second period classes each sold brownies to raise money for charity</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">after a forest fire destroyed many local businesses. There are 24 students in the first period class and 29 in the second period class. Each student in the class sold brownies and then reported the number of brownies they sold to Ms. Pearson. The data for the number of brownies sold by each student are displayed in the box and whisker plot below.

This rule is very rarely tested, but, if it does appear on the ACT, it appears in the hardest questions at the end of the test and are usually pretty easy to solve as long as you have the rule below memorized. The Empirical Rule e</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">68% of the data is within one</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">standard deviation of the mean.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">68%</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">e 95% of the data is within two</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">standard deviations of the mean.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">e 99.7% of the data is within three standard deviations of the mean.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">|</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">95%</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Z</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">/</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">|</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">\\</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">99.7%</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">aA</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">-3</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">q</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">|</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">-2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">-1</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">0</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">SN</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">_</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">JI</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">+1</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">+2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">+3</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Standard Deviations Looking at the normal distribution shown above, the mean is the very middle line. The empirical rule tells us that 68% of the data points lie within 1 standard deviation of the mean. In other words, 68% of the data points are between the -1 and +1 on the graph above. 95% of the data points lie within 2 standard deviations of the mean, which tells us that 95% of the data points are between the -2 and +2 on the graph above. Finally, 99.7%</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">of the data points lie within 3 standard deviations of the mean, so 99.7% of the data points are between the -3 and +3 on the graph above. As we already said, this is very rarely tested. When this has appeared on the ACT, you have just needed to have the empirical rule memorized. The example below shows how this has been tested in the past. There are a few more advanced examples in the problem set for you to complete in case the ACT presents this is a more difficult way.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 8: The scores on a fitness test are normally distributed. The mean score was 110 and the</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">standard deviation was 10.

This means that the score of 90, which is 20 points below 110, is exactly 2 standard deviations below the mean, and the score of 130, which is 20 points above 110, is exactly 2 standard deviations above the mean. The empirical rule tells us that 95% of the data points lie within 2 standard deviations of the mean. Therefore, 95% of the scores are between 90 and 130. The answer is C.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 298</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Statistics</h3>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>",

There is a wide range of Statistics topics that are included on the ACT, all of which we will cover in this lesson. Most students have learned minimal or no statistics in math class, so these topics usually challenge students simply because they do not know the rules or definitions. If you memorize all the rules and definitions in this lesson, you will be prepared for any statistics questions on the ACT.</p>\n\n  <p>Description of A Survey Imagine we want to find how many pairs of shoes students the average student at a high school owns. To find out, we would conduct a survey where we ask a population of students at the school how many pairs of shoes they own. For this example, let’s say there are 500 students at a high school. In statistics, there are a variety of methods of surveying that you need to be familiar with. The common definitions, along with an example for how we would apply it to our pair shoes survey, are listed below. e</p>\n\n  <p>Census: A survey that includes every member of the population. If we conduct a census for our example, we survey all 500 students at the high school. This method would find the true value for the average number of pairs of shoes students at the high school own.</p>\n\n  <p>Sample Survey: A survey that includes a selected subset (smaller group) of the population. If we conduct a sample survey for our example, we survey a small group of students, say 50 students, and would use their answers to make an estimate about the average number of pairs of shoes each student at the high school owns. We would not be able to find the true value — only an estimate.</p>\n\n  <p>Randomized: Participants are randomly selected from the group. A randomized study/survey</p>\n\n  <p>produces reliable results. An example of a randomized survey would be if we randomly selected 50 students at the high school and asked them how many pairs of shoes they own. This would give us an estimate for the average number of pairs of shoes each student at the high school owns. e</p>\n\n  <p>Non-randomized: Participants are not randomly selected from the group. A nonrandomized</p>\n\n  <p>study/survey can lead to biased results. An example of a nonrandomized survey would be if we ask the first 50 students who arrive at school how many pairs of shoes they own. This may produce a biased (inaccurate) result because we do not get a random sample of the entire population (all 500 students). For example, if the football team has practice before school, the first 50 students to show up might all be boys who are football players. The average number of pairs of shoes the 50 football players own is not likely representative of how many shoes on average the rest of the students at the high school own.</p>\n\n  <p>If you understand these descriptions of a survey, you should be prepared for any questions related to this on test day.</p>\n\n</div>",

Solving simpler questions like Example 1 algebraically works but using substitution is a good backup method.

Factoring can help you simplify expressions or identify the solutions of a quadratic equation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The “Box” Method We can use the “box” method to find the factors for a quadratic equation. The factors will appear on the outside of the box and the quadratic will appear in the box.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">To see how this works, let’s factor the quadratic below:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">f(x) = 3x7-x-2</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x</p>\n\n<ol class=\"instruction-list\">\n<li>Place the x? term in the top left of the box.

If you have a different method that works for you, use that method. We will not review factoring any more beyond this example in this course. If you need to review factoring, look up some lessons and practice problems online and in your textbooks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">“Easy to Factor” Quadratics Keep an eye out for perfect squares and difference of squares on the ACT. These are very common in quadratics questions, and they can be factored quickly and easily as long as you spot the pattern.

We will refer to these as the “solutions” in the rest of this lesson. To find the solution(s), set the quadratic equation equal to zero and factor. Let’s pick up with the example we are currently working on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">3x*-x-2=0 We just showed how we can factor this quadratic to get</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(3x + 2)(x-1) =0 To find the solutions, set each factor equal to zero and solve. 3x+2=0</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x-1=0</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x=--</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">and</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x=1</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The solutions are x = = and x = 1.

In other words, the function does not have any x-intercepts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">As an example, the function f(x) to the right has no real solutions. This function cannot be factored to solve for any real values of x.

At x = 3, the function goes straight through, so the (x — 3) should be to the first power. The answer is A. Shortcut Solution — Use Your Graphing Calculator (if you have one): For those of you with a graphing calculator who know how to use it, you can just graph the answer choices and see which one matches the graph! Sure, it may take some time, but you will be able to guarantee that you get the correct answer.

As you can see in</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">the example above, we can tell the vertex is at (1,—4). We can think of the vertex as the midpoint of a parabola because the x-coordinate of the vertex is always the midpoint of the two solutions, or x-intercepts. The x-coordinate of the vertex is equal to the average of the solutions. Using the parabola above as an example, we can see how this works. Since the solutions to the parabola are located at x = —1 and x = 3, the x-coordinate of the vertex is at x =</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">—14+3</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">= 1, which matches the graph.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Remember, the vertex is always the maximum or minimum of a quadratic. For the example above, the minimum is at y = —4.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 9: For the equation f(x) = (x — 6)(x + 2), what is the value of x at the minimum value of</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">the function?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">—2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B. 0</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C. 2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D. 4</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: The minimum value of a parabola is at the vertex, so we need to find the coordinates of the vertex. Since the function is already in factored form, we see the solutions are at x = 6 and x = —2. The x-coordinate of the vertex is the average of the solutions, so we can find</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">_ 64+(-2) _</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">==</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The x-coordinate of the vertex is at x = 2, so the answer is C. Shortcut Method — Backsolve: To find which answer choice minimizes the function, plug the answer</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">choices in for x and see which one gives you the smallest value for f(x).</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The average method works perfectly if you are given a quadratic that is already factored. But what if you are not given a quadratic in factored form or vertex form? Good news! There is a second way to quickly find the vertex.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">For any quadratic in the form of ax* + bx + c, you can find the x-coordinate of the vertex using b Za</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Make sure you memorize this equation! It can really help you quickly and easily solve any questions where you need to find the vertex of a parabola.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 140</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Quadratics</h3>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 10: Andre runs a business that sells used cameras.

With that being said, any students aiming for a math score of 30 and above should still make sure that you memorize all of the logarithm rules just in case!</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Natural Logarithms On rare occasions, the ACT may also ask you questions with natural logarithms. Natural logarithm questions are very uncommon, so this is a topic that anyone rushing through this course can skip. Any</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">natural logarithms questions are almost guaranteed to appear in the difficult questions at the end of the math test.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The same rules that we have covered so far in this lesson all apply for natural logarithms, except than</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">the base is always “e,” which is an irrational number approximately equal to 2.71828. The base is not actually written in natural logarithms, so the “e” is invisible. Inb=c</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">iS same as</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">e©=b</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Whenever there is a natural logarithm question on the ACT, it most commonly asks you to solve for a variable. To do so, you will need to go from logarithmic form to exponential form and then solve for the variable using basic algebra.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 5: If In(x — 1) = 3, thenx =?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">e? +1</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">B. 1-e?</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">C. n2</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">D. n3+1</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: First, we need to go from logarithmic form to exponential form. The base 1s e and the exponent is 3, SO we get</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">ee=x-1 To solve, we add 1 to both sides to isolate x.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">ee+1=x The answer is A.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 124</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Logarithms</h3>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>",

Word problems are often written in a way that makes it confusing to figure out exactly what is happening in the question. Word problems include a wide variety of math topics that we have already learned</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">in this course, so we will not cover any specific type of word problem in this lesson. Instead, we will focus on the tips that can help you solve all types of word problems more effectively and efficiently.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Tip #1 — Do Not Be Intimidated Word problems look scary. Many students see a big paragraph and say, “no way, I can’t solve that.” They feel intimidated before even trying to solve the question. Do not let this be you! Word problems at their core are no more difficult than any other ACT Math questions. When you see a big paragraph on test day, take a deep</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">breath and solve it one step at a time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Tip #2 — Turn Words into Equations When approaching a word problem, take it one sentence at a time. As you read through the question, identify each piece of key information and write it down in an equation. If you can convert the question from a word problem into an equation or equation(s), the question will be much easier to solve. One of the most common types of word problems is a system of equations question, which we covered in Lesson on pp. 129-130. For these questions, you will need to turn the word problem into two equations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Once you have converted the word problem into two equations, you will be able to solve the question with the methods we learned in Lesson.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Tip #3 — Backsolve with the Answer Choices For some word problems, writing your own equation(s) is very difficult and may not be the fastest or easiest way to solve. If you cannot write out the equation(s) or are not sure if the equation(s) that you wrote are correct, try backsolving. Sometimes it is faster and easier to take the answer choices, go through the steps of the word problem, and see if you have the correct answer. Even if you cannot tell which answer is correct, backsolving can often help you eliminate some answer choices and make a better guess. If you need to review how to backsolve, go back to Lesson.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Tip #4 — Guess and Move on (If You Have To) If you get to a word problem, try using the tips above, and still have no idea how to solve it, circle the question, bubble in your best guess, and move on! It is easy to waste a lot of time reading and rereading long, confusing word problems. Students who do this often end up running out of time. Save those precious minutes to answer more questions that you know how to solve. We know it sounds backwards but giving up quickly on a word problem that you have no idea how to solve may help you actually get a better score. If you complete the rest of the questions in the section and have time remaining, you can always come back to any questions that you guessed on. Sometimes, when re-reading the question, you will realize how to solve it. It is easier to think more clearly when you are no longer worried about finishing the rest of the questions on the test.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 246</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Word Problems</h3>\n\n</div>",

    "originalContent": "<div class=\"lesson-content\">\n  <h2 class=\"lesson-title\">Lesson: Algebra Skills</h2>\n\n  <h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Algebra Skills</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Many ACT questions test your core algebra skills. To answer these questions correctly, we need to be able to isolate an unknown such as x or y or solve an equation. For any algebra question, be sure to take your time, write out each step of the question, and use the calculator to avoid silly mistakes like making a mental math error or forgetting a negative sign.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">In this section, we will cover the algebra skills that you will need in your toolbox for test day.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1. PEMDAS</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">In algebra, order of operations is critical to solving math questions correctly. PEMDAS 1s an acronym to help</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">you remember the order of operations in algebra. The rules of PEMDAS are below:</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">P-— Parentheses: Complete any calculations inside parentheses first.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">E-—Exponents: Next, complete any exponents or square roots.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">MD-— Multiplication and Division: Complete any multiplication and division (left-to-right)</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">4.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">AS-— Addition and Subtraction: Complete any addition and subtraction (left-to-right)</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Make sure you do the multiplication and division step left-to right! This is where the ACT most often tries to trick students. For example, if we are given 16+4x2-—3</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We need to work left-to-right when completing multiplication and division. If solved correctly, we will start by dividing 16 by 4 and then multiply by 2. Once we complete the multiplication and division, we will subtract 3.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Correct: 16+4xX2—-3 =4x2-3 =8-3 =5</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Many students make the mistake of doing the multiplication first and then dividing.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Incorrect:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">16+4x2—3 = 16+8-3 = 2-3 =-1</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 1: What is the value of the expression 22 + (—4)? +2 x (5+ 10)?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">285</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">142</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">120</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D. 72</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Solution: First, complete any calculations in parentheses.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">22 + (—4)?+2x15 Next, complete the exponents. 22+16+2x15</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Complete any multiplication and division from left-to-right. 22+16+2xX15= 22+8x15=22+4+120 Finally, complete the addition.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">22 +120 = 142</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The answer is B. As long as you follow the PEMDAS steps correctly and work left-to-right correctly, these questions should be easy! Shortcut Solution — Use Your Calculator: You can also enter these questions directly into your calculator. Your calculator is programed to do PEMDAS correctly, so as long as you enter the equation correctly, the calculator will just tell you the answer. It’s that easy!</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">-52</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Algebra Skills</h3>\n\n<ol class=\"instruction-list\">\n<li>Negative Numbers</li>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The ACT really really really loves questions with negative numbers. These questions are a prime place where</p>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">students make simple mistakes by not knowing how to properly do algebra with negative numbers. Let’s review where students most often make mistakes to make sure that you ace these questions on test day.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Subtracting Negative Numbers You likely already know that when subtracting a negative number, the negative signs turn into a positive sign and you add the numbers together. For example,</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2—(-4)=24+4=6</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">That’s easy! The mistake students more often make is forgetting to distribute a negative sign to multiple terms. For example, if you are solving 5x — (2x —5) make sure to distribute the negative sign to both the 2x and the —5. Many students forget to distribute the negative sign.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Incorrect: 5x — (2x —5) = 5x-—2x-5= 3x—5</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Correct: 5x — (2x —5) = 5x-—2x—(—5) = 3x4+5</h3>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 2: Which of the following expressions is equivalent to 2(a + b) — 3(a — 4b) ?</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">A. —a+14b B. —a + 6b C. —a— 3b D. —a — 9b</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">G)</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Solution: Distribute the —3 to both the a and —4b and combine like terms.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">2(a+ b)—3(a—4b) = 2a+ 2b — 3a — 3(-4b) = 2a+ 2b—-—3a+12b = -—a+14b The answer is A.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Negative Numbers and Exponents The second common mistake occurs when negative numbers are raised to a power. The important thing to understand is</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">—2? is not the same as (—2)? For —2?, you first square the 2 and then multiply by the negative sign. For (—2)?, you just square —2. Asa result, we see</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">—2? = -4</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">(-2)? = 4</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">This principle is very important to understand and can be tested on more difficult ACT questions. Make sure you always put negative numbers in parentheses when you enter them into your calculator! If you do not use the parentheses, you will get the wrong answer.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 3: If x is a real number such that —x? < 0, which of the following must be true?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">#0</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x >0</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">C.x <0</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x 20</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution — “Math Teacher Way”: The negative sign is not in parentheses, so we need to do the exponent</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">first and then multiply by the negative sign. In order for —x? to be negative, x? must be positive. For x? to be</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">positive, x must be positive. x cannot equal 0 since —0? = 0. The answer is B.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">53</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">G)</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Shortcut Solution — Substitution: For conceptual math questions like this, it is easiest to pick test numbers, plug them into the equation, and see if they work or not. Here, let’s try x = —2, x = 0, and x = 2.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Forx = —2,-(—2)? = -(-8) = 8 For x = 0, —(0)? = 0 Forx = 2,-(2)? = —(8) = -8 The only value that gave a number less than 0 is x = 2, so the answer is B.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">©</h3>\n\n<ol class=\"instruction-list\">\n<li>Combining Like Terms</li>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Whenever you have the chance, you should combine like terms. Doing so will help you simplify the equation and get to the correct answer more quickly.</p>\n\n</ol>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 4: If 2(3x — 6) + 3y = 6x — y + 8, what is the value of y?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">-1</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Solution: First, distribute the 2 on the left side of the equation.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">6x —12+3y =6x-—y+8</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We have x and y terms on both sides of the equation, so we need to combine like terms. Here, the 6x terms on both sides cancel, so we get —12+3y=-y+8</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Now, combine the y-terms and the numbers and solve. Add y and 12 to both sides to get. Ay = 20</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">y=5 The answer is A.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">©</h3>\n\n<ol class=\"instruction-list\">\n<li>Cross Multiply Fractions</li>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Whenever you have two fractions equal to one another, we can cross multiply to get rid of the fractions. xy</p>\n\n</ol>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Z</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Cross multiplying, we get</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Ww</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">xwW = yz</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 5: If = = - , what is the value of x?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A=</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">14</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B448</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">cf7</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Ds3</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Solution:</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">*=5</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">4</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">7</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">21x = 24</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">,</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">24</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">8</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">21</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">7</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The answer is C.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">-54</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Algebra Skills</h3>\n\n<ol class=\"instruction-list\">\n<li>Square Both Sides of an Equation Correctly</li>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">In algebra questions with square roots, you often need to square both sides to get rid of the square root. It is important to remember that you need to square both sides and not just each individual term. Students will often make a mistake on a question like the example below.</p>\n\n</ol>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 6:</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Vx =x-2</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">What value(s) of x solve the equation above?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">4</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1,4</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: When we see the x under the square root in this question, we start by squaring both sides of the equation. Most students will properly get rid of the square root on the left side of the equation, but they make</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">a mistake on the right side by doing this:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x=x?-4 WRONG! We cannot just square each individual term. We must square the entire equation on each</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">side, so it should look like this:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(vx)? = (x — 2)? If you prefer, you can also write out the right side of the equation like this to help make sure you remember to properly expand the expression.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(Vx)? = (x — 2)(x — 2) If we properly square both sides of the equation, we get</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x=x*-4Ax+4 From here, we can combine like terms, set the equation equal to zero, and factor. Moving all of the terms to the right side, we get</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">O0=x*-—5x4+4 0= (x-4)(x-1) x=1,4</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">It looks like there are two answers to this question, but that is not the case! Anytime you square both sides of an equation, you NEED to plug the answers back into the original equation to look for extraneous</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">solutions. Sometimes when you square both sides of an equation, you get fake answers that look correct but do not actually work. Let’s start by checking x = 1.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">v1=1-2</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">14-1</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We see that x = 1 does not work in the original equation, so it is an extraneous solution. Now, we can check x=4.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">V4=4-2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2=2</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We find that x = 4 works in the original equation, so the answer is B. Shortcut solution — Backsolve: We can backsolve this question using the answer choices. By plugging the answer choices in of 1, 2, and 4 in for x, we can test each answer choice. Only 4 works, so the answer is B. Test-Taking Tip: Whenever you see a question like this, you should just plug the answer choices back</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">in. It is much faster and easier than solving out algebraically!</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">-55</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<ol class=\"instruction-list\">\n<li>Algebra with Inequality Signs</li>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">To solve inequalities on the ACT, treat the inequality signs (<,>,<, =) like an = sign and solve using algebra. Inequalities can be solved as normal algebraic expressions with the exception of one very important</p>\n\n</ol>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">rule:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">When multiplying or dividing by a negative number, switch the direction of the inequality sign.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">This rule is the most important thing to remember from this section and where students most commonly make</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">mistakes on inequalities questions. As a quick example, let’s see how to solve the equation below. —5x-3>11 —5x</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">> 14</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">When dividing by —5, we switch the direction inequality sign, so</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">14</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x<></p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Let’s see a second example:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">5x +10 < 2x — 44 The first step is combining like terms. We subtract 2x from both sides to get the x-terms on the left side. We</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">then subtract 10 from both sides to get the numbers on the right side. 5x — 2x < —44—10 3x</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">< —54</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x<—2</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x<-18</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">In this example, we never multiply or divide by a negative number, so the inequality sign stays the same. Just</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">because we are working with a negative number does not mean we need to flip the inequality sign. Some students flip the sign whenever they divide and see a negative sign. Don’t make that mistake! Only flip the inequality when you multiply or divide both sides by a negative number.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 7: Which of the following inequalities 1s equivalent to 2x — 6y < 4x — 14?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x > 6y — 14</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x >3y—7</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">C.x<—-3y+7</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x > -3y+7</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: To solve, we need to isolate x. We need to do this because all the answer choices have x isolated on the left side of the equation. To isolate x, we need to move the x-terms to the left side and all other terms to the right side. To do this, we need to subtract 4x from both sides and add 6y to both sides. 2x —6y < 4x — 14 2x —4x < 6y — 14 —2x < 6y— 14</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">To get x by itself, we need to divide both sides by —2. Since we are dividing by a negative, we also need to switch the direction of the inequality sign. x></p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">6y — 14</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">—2</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Now, we can simplify the terms on the night side of the equation and solve. x>—-3y+7 The answer is D.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">-56</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Algebra Skills</h3>\n\n<ol class=\"instruction-list\">\n<li>Taking Square Roots in Algebraic Equations</li>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">When solving an algebra question, you may need to find the value of a variable that is squared. For example, if we have the equation</p>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x2 =9 we need to take the square root of both sides to solve. Many students take the square root and get x = 3, which is WRONG! To take the square root properly, we need to use the following rule</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">When taking the square root of a squared variable (x*), add a + in front of the number. For the example equation above, we should solve using the following steps to solve properly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x? =9 [x2</p>\n\n<ol class=\"instruction-list\">\n<li>Take square root of both sides.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">= +9</h3>\n\n<ol class=\"instruction-list\">\n<li>Adda +</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">y= 43</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">sign in front of the number.</p>\n\n<ol class=\"instruction-list\">\n<li>Simplify</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x = —-3,3</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Notice that we get 2 answers! This makes sense because both (—3)? and 3? equal 9. Now, it is important to clarify that this only applies to taking the square root of algebraic equations with</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">squared terms, like x*. You do not add a + sign when taking the square root of only a number.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Correct: /9 = 3</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Incorrect: /9 = +3</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The square root of 9 is only 3, not +3. Square roots are always positive. Understanding this difference is important for solving questions involving square roots and variables correctly.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 8: What value(s) of x are solutions to the equation x? + 10 = 46?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A. —6 B. 6 C. 0,6 D. —6,6</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: When solving an equation with an x* term and numbers, start by getting the x? term on one side by itself. To do that, we need to subtract 10 from both sides.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x? +10</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">= 46</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">= 36</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Now, we can take the square root of both sides.

To answer these questions correctly, we need to be able to isolate an unknown such as x or y or solve an equation. For any algebra question, be sure to take your time, write out each step of the question, and use the calculator to avoid silly mistakes like making a mental math error or forgetting a negative sign.</p>\n\n  <p>In this section, we will cover the algebra skills that you will need in your toolbox for test day.</p>\n\n  <p>1. PEMDAS</p>\n\n  <p>In algebra, order of operations is critical to solving math questions correctly. PEMDAS 1s an acronym to help</p>\n\n  <h3>you remember the order of operations in algebra.

We would guess your answer is numbers! On the ACT,</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">some questions have many unknown variables and few or no numbers at all. Students often find these</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">questions more difficult. If you prefer to work with numbers, let’s work with numbers! With substitution, we substitute simple numbers in for variables and solve the question using numbers instead of relying on more complex algebra with variables.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Substitution can be done with these four steps:</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Pick a number for the variable(s) in the question.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Pick easy numbers...avoid using 0 and 1. Use 2, 3, 4 or other easy numbers. Use 10 for percent problems, 10 or 20 for group size, etc.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">b.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Select different numbers for each variable. For example, if a question has an x and a y, pick x =2andy =3.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">c.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Follow any rules in the question. For example, if a question says x is a number that is negative and even, pick x = —2.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Write down the number(s) that you have picked.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Use your number(s) to work your way through the question and find your answer.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">4.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Plug your number(s) into the answer choices. The correct answer will be the one that matches your answer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Substitution may seem a bit confusing just reading the steps, so let’s take a look at some example questions to see how useful this technique can be.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 1: Jeremy has n boxes of candy bars. Each box contains m bars of candy. Jeremy has to sell</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">70% of his candy bars to make enough money for rent. Which of the following expresses the number of candy bars Jeremy must sell in terms of m and n?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<ol class=\"instruction-list\">\n<li>7(m +n)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">B. 70nm</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">C.nm+m</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">D. 0.7nm</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: This question may at first seem intimidating with all the variables. To make this question easier, let’s plug in numbers. We can say that Jeremy has 2 boxes of candy, so n = 2, and that each box contains 5 bars of candy, som = 5. With our numbers, Jeremy has a total of 10 candy bars. He needs to sell 70% to make enough money for rent, so we can find the total candy bars that he must sell by finding 70% of 10.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">0.7(10) =7</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">With our numbers, Jeremy must sell 7 candy bars, so our answer is 7. Now, we can plug in the values we selected for n and m into the answer choices and see which one is equal to 7. Here, we find that D works.</p>\n\n<ol class=\"instruction-list\">\n<li>7nm = 0.7(2)(5) = 7</li>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">None of the other answer choices are equal to 7 when we plug in our values for n and m. No matter what numbers you pick for n and m, you will find that D is the answer.</p>\n\n</ol>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 2: If cos (2x°) = a, which of the following must be true for all values of x, in degrees?</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">A. sin(2x°)=a_</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">B. sin(x°+90°)=a_</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">C. cos(90°—2x°)=a _</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">D. sin(90° — 2x°) =a</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: The easiest way to solve this question is to pick a value for x and use your calculator. Let’s pick x = 10°. First, we need to find out what a equals if x = 10°.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">cos(20°) = 0.9397</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">(1-4)</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Now that we know what a equals, we can plug in x = 10° for the x-values in the answer choices to see which is equal to 0.9397. Here, we can see how the correct answer choice of D works.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">sin(90° — 20°) = sin(70°) = 0.9397 This trick will work for any value of x that we pick. The answer is D. Note that since we are solving in</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">degrees, your calculator must be in degree mode. If you get a value other than cos(20) = 0.9397 when you input cos(20) in your calculator, your calculator is in radian mode.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 3: If the length of a rectangle is tripled and the width is halved, how many times larger is the</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">area of the new rectangle than the area of the original rectangle?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1.5</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B. 2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C. 3</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D. 4</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: To make this question easier, we can pick values for the length and width of the rectangle. Let’s make the length 3 and the width 2. Now, we just follow the steps in the questions. Original</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">The length is tripled: 3(3) =9 The new length is 9.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">New</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">The width is halved: 2(-) =1 The new widthis 1.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Next, we find the areas of the rectangles and compare. The new rectangle has an area of 9. The original rectangle has an area of 6, so we find that the new rectangle is 1.5 times as large. The answer is A</p>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>",

The answer is D.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Alternate Method — Plug a point into y = mx + b form. When dealing with lines in y = mx + b form, you can also plug the (x, y) coordinates of a point on the line into the equation and then solve for the y-intercept. To see how this works, let’s go back to example 5.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Once we found the slope was —4, we could have set the equation up like this:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">y=—-4x+b</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">To find b-value, we can plug in one of the points from the line for x and y and solve for b. Here, we will</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">use (2, 10).</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">10 = —4(2) +b b=18</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Now that we know the b-value, we can write the equation in slope-intercept form: y=-4x+18</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Note that this “Plug a point into y = mx + b form” approach and the point-slope form method we used in the solution to Example 5 both find slope-intercept form. You can use whichever one you feel more comfortable with on test day.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">~34</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Lines</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Standard Form</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lines can also appear in standard form:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Ax+By=C</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The coefficients in this form do not show the slope or the y-intercept.

Let’s say the original price of Fred’s bicycle $100. 100 is always a good number to pick for percentage problems because it is easy to calculate percent changes from 100.

Sometimes, we just know that one value is bigger or smaller when compared to another value. In these situations, we use inequalities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Algebra with Inequalities To solve inequalities on the ACT, treat the inequality signs (<,>,<, =) like an = sign and solve using algebra. Inequalities can be solved as normal algebraic expressions with the exception of one very important</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">rule:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">When multiplying or dividing by a negative number, switch the direction of the inequality sign.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">This rule is the most important thing to remember from this section and where students most commonly make</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">mistakes on inequalities questions. As a quick example, let’s see how to solve the equation below. —2x+5<11 —2x <6</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">When dividing by —2, we switch the direction inequality sign, so x>-3</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Let’s see a second example:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">3x+6>x—4</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The first step is combining like terms. We subtract x from both sides to get the x-terms on the left side. We</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">then subtract 6 from both sides to get the numbers on the right side. 3x—x>--4-6 2x >-10</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x>-5 In this example, we never multiply or divide by a negative number, so the inequality sign stays the same. Just</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">because we are working with a negative number does not mean we need to flip the inequality sign. Some students flip the sign whenever they divide and see a negative sign. Don’t make that mistake! Only flip the inequality when you multiply or divide both sides by a negative number.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 1: Which of the following inequalities describes the solution set for 6x</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">29</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">A. x2 ></p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Boxs</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">29</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">C.xs-7</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">+12 < 9x +17?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">D.x2-7</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: To solve, we need to isolate x.

For a system of inequalities in the coordinate plane, the solution is where the shaded regions overlap. For example, let’s consider the system of inequalities 4x — 2y > 8 and x + 3y > —2. To graph these inequalities, we need to rearrange them into slope-intercept form to isolate y.

Advanced Graphing Inequalities On more difficult questions, the ACT will ask you how to graph inequalities with parabolas, circles, and even ellipses. All these graphs still follow the same rules we just discussed for the solid lines vs. dashed lines. Students most commonly get confused about where to shade for these inequalities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Parabolas Parabolas shade just like lines do. For greater than and greater than or equal to (> and =), shade above the line. For less than and less than or equal to (< and <), shade below the line.

In this question, the equation of the line must be y = —2x + 2 or y = —2x — 2. The y-intercept is at 2, so we know D</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">is incorrect. We need</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">to shade below the line, so the equation for the line must be y < —2x + 2. C is also incorrect. Notice that the equation of the parabola is the same in all of the answer choices. On questions like this, you do not need to be able to write the equation of the parabola yourself. You just need to know which inequality sign to use based on where the solution set is. Here, the solution set is above the parabola, so the inequality sign</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">must be >.

To solve these questions correctly, we need to use SOH-CAH-TOA and then solve for the unknown side.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 5: In the triangle below, which of the following expressions is equal to x?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">9sin 67°</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">9cos 67°</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">9</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">S 9 on 67°</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2 9 = 67°</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">67°</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: The first step is to identify which trigonometric function involves the values we are given and x. We know angle A, the hypotenuse, and are solving for the opposite, so we use the sine function. We can set up the sine function and plug in the values we are given.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">sind = —2Ppeste_ =, sin67° =~9 hypotenuse Next, we solve for x by multiplying both sides by 9 and get x = 9sin67°</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The answer is A. If the question asks for the numerical value of x, we can plug 9 sin 67° into the calculator to find the actual length, which here is 8.28. When solving trigonometry functions in your calculator, make sure that you have your calculator in the correct mode. Calculators have 2 modes (degree mode and radian mode). If you are entering an angle measured in degrees, such as 9 sin 67°, you must use degree mode. If you are entering an angle measured in radians, you must use radian mode. If you are not familiar with radians, we will learn about them later in this lesson.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 147</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Another version of a question testing this concept gives us no angle but tells us the value of the sine, cosine, or tangent. With no angle, using trigonometry seems confusing at first, but, if we know how to set up trigonometric functions, we solve with the same SOH-CAH-TOA knowledge we used in Example 4.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 6: In triangle ABC shown below, cos B = - and the length of AB is 6.

To start, you need to know the basics of what a sine and cosine function look like when graphed. If you have never learned sine and cosine functions, memorize the basics about each function listed below. This will help you solve most questions on this topic on test day.

If you have never learned radians, do not focus too much on this, as you only need to understand the basics for the ACT. Radians are just another way to measure an angle. The conversion is 7 radians = 180 degrees. Trigonometric functions are most commonly graphed with radians on the x-axis. *Note that the “basics to know” listed above only apply are for sine and cosine functions where only the amplitude and period (more on those shortly) are changed. Horizontal shifts can change the start and end points of the functions.

Looking at the graph, we see that the period is 477. Remember, the easiest way to find the period from a graph is to look for the distance between the peaks of the function.

Advanced sine and cosine graphing questions can include vertical or horizonal shifts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Vertical Shifts A constant added or subtracted to a sine or cosine function causes a vertical shift.

The amplitude of f(x) is 2, so the minimum value of the function isa y = —2.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">To have no x-intercepts, we must shift the function up by more than 2 units, so the answer is C. If we shift</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">f(x) up exactly 2 units, the minimum points will be on the x-axis, so there will still be x-intercepts. If we shift f(x) up by less than 2 units, there will be even more multiple x-intercepts.

The easiest way to find the period of a tangent function is to find the distance between the vertical asymptotes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Transformations of Tangent Functions Tangent functions follow the same rules as sine and cosine functions for vertical and horizontal shifting</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">that we summarized on the previous page. That covers pretty much everything you need to know for tangent graphs on the ACT! If you know the basics of what a tangent graph looks like, how to find the period of a tangent function, and the rules for vertical and horizontal shifting, you should be able to solve a tangent graphing question if it appears on your ACT.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 156</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Trigonometry</h3>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 12: Which of the following equations properly describes the function shown below?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">y=tan2x—-1</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">GUO</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">y=tan4x—-1</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">y=tanx—-2</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">y=tan>-1</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">ins</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">(</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">I</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">if\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Tf</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">7</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">I</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Solution: To solve, we need to find (1) the vertical shift and (2) the period.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The vertical shift is the easier part, so we will start with that.

Many of you will have never learned these before, so we will teach you everything you need to know in this lesson. These two topics are very common on the ACT, so you need to memorize both the law of sines and law of cosines equations for test day.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Law of Sines The Law of Sines rules written below is true for any type of triangle.

For Law of Sines (and Law of Cosines), we no longer use</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">SOH-CAH-TOA. So, for the sines in the equation above, do not think opposite over hypotenuse. Instead, remember that an expression such as sin(20°) has a numerical value, so we treat it as a number.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Law of Sines can also be written as:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">b</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">c</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">sin(A) sin(B) sin(C) This equation is the same as the one above — everything is just flipped. You can memorize and use either equation. Both are equally effective. You need to memorize the equation because the ACT does not always give it to you on the test. We use the Law of Sines to solve for an unknown side or angle in a triangle.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 13: Which of the following correctly solve for the value of x in the triangle below?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">850sin(28°) sin (110°)</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">7.90</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">110°</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">850sin (28°)</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">850</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">tan (110°)</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">850</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">850sin (28°) sin (110°)</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: When solving Law of Sines questions, we want to look for pairs of angles and opposite side lengths.

Law of Cosines is used to find a missing side or angle in a non-right triangle. The Law of Cosines equation is</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">show below:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a* = b* + c* — 2be cos(A)</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">c</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">b</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We use Law of Cosines when we do not have two pairs of angles and opposite side lengths. It is important to notice that the a-value in the equation is the side length opposite the angle A. The other two side lengths, b and c, are interchangeable since they do the same thing in the equation. On the ACT, you are not always given the Law of Cosines, so you need to memorize the equation. The ACT sometimes includes the equation in a note below the question, but it is not always provided. You need to know how to set up the Law of Cosines correctly. Depending on the difficult of the question, you may need to perform additional algebra to solve for the unknown value, as we did in the Law of Sines examples.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 15: Three dancers, Alex, Bialy, and Charlie, are standing on stage at the points shown by the</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">comers of the triangle below.

The triangle is not a right triangle, so we cannot use normal SOH-CAH-TOA. We are not provided two pairs of angles and opposite side lengths, so we cannot use Law of Sines. The side length we are solving for is opposite the angle that we are given, so the length between Bialy and Charlie is the a-value. 35 and 31 are b and c. Plugging these values into the Law of Cosines equation, we get:</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a* = 357 + 31? — 2(35)(31) cos 28° To solve for a, we take the square root of both sides.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a = 352 + 312 — 2(35)(31) cos 28° The answer is C.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">*Note: For Law of Cosines questions on the ACT, the answer choices usually give away that you need to use Law of Cosines.

The one your math teacher made you memorize all of those points for? Well, it’s back. However, the unit circle is NOT a commonly tested topic on the ACT (and the least commonly tested trigonometry topic). You should only study this if you feel confident on the other trigonometry topics or are aiming for a top ACT Math score.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">You do not need to memorize all the points but should know the basics of the unit circle for the ACT.

A complete unit circle is shown below.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">(0, 1)</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">7</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Angles on the unit circle can be expressed in degrees or radians. Just as we can describe the temperature in Fahrenheit or Celsius, we can describe an angle in degree or radians. If you have not worked with radians before, all you need to know is that 7 radians = 180 degrees. It is important to memorize this conversion for test day. We will cover radians vs. degrees at the end of this lesson in more depth. There are a few important principles to know with the unit circle.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The cosine of any angle on the unit circle is equal to the x-coordinate of the corresponding point.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">For example, cos(60°) = 2.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The sine of any angle on the unit circle is equal to the y-coordinate of the corresponding point.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">For example, sin(60°) = 4</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The tangent of any angle on the unit circle is equal to</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">y—coordinate x—coordinate</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">¥3/2</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">.

The unit circle below shows the values (positive or negative) for cosine, sine, and tangent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Sine Positive</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">All Positive</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">ns</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Tangent Positive</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Cosine Positive</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">A common moniker to memorize this is “All Student Take Calculus.” “AII” tells us all 3 values are positive in</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">the 1st quadrant. “Students” stands for Sine and tells us only sine 1s positive in the 2nd quadrant and the other values are negative. “Take” stands for Tangent and tells us only tangent is positive in the 3rd quadrant. “Calculus” tells us only Cosine is positive in the 4th quadrant.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 162</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Trigonometry</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The most common way the ACT tests this knowledge is with a more advanced version of Example 3 that we solved earlier in this lesson.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 17: For an angle with a measure of q in a right triangle, sing = = and tang = — =, what is the</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">value of cos q ?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A -=</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">15</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B-=</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">9</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">c=</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">9</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">ode</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">15</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: This question is identical to Example 3 except that tan q is now negative instead of positive? How does that change the question? Well, since sin > 0 and tan < 0, we know that g must be in the 2nd quadrant. In the 2nd quadrant, cos < 0, so we already know that C, D, and E are incorrect. The rest of the solution is the same as we already did for Example 3, so we will not show it again here. The</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">only difference is that when we solve for cos gq = = from the triangle we drew, we make the value negative since we are in the 2nd quadrant, so the answer is A.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Radians vs. Degrees Radians are another unit to measure angles. Just like we can measure temperature in Fahrenheit or Celsius, we can measure an angle in degrees or radians. For the ACT, you need memorize the conversion below: 7 radians = 180°</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">To convert between radians and degrees, use following 2 rules:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">o</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">To convert from radians to degrees, multiply by a</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">To convert from degrees to radians, multiply by</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Madi’</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">W radians</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">180°</h3>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 18: Angle D has a measure of 200°.

Some examples that you may be familiar with include money in a bank account earning 8% interest each year or the number of bacteria on a plate doubling every week. For most questions on the ACT, we use the simpler form of the exponential growth and decay equations shown</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">below:</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Growth:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">A=P(1+r)!</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Decay:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">A=P(i-r)é</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">P = initial value</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">A = current value</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">r = rate of the growth or decay t = time interval</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We use the simple form of the equation above when the time interval is in years, which is most common on the ACT. At the end of this lesson, we will introduce you to the more complex form just in case it appears on your ACT.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Exponential Growth To see how these equations work and appear on a graph, let’s examine the equation for a bank account that has</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">an initial balance of $100 and an 8% annual interest rate.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A= 100(1 + 0.08)*</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A = 100(1.08)¢</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The $100 is the initial value, and the 8% is the growth rate. 8% is expressed as 0.08 in decimal form, so we get a value of 1.08 inside the parentheses. A represents the current value after ¢ time intervals. Since the amount of money in the bank account is increasing at a non-linear rate over time, we have exponential growth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Now, let’s see how this exponential growth equation appears on a graph.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">250</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">200</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">0</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">‘</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">aA</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">4</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">6</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">7</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">€&</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">9</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">For any exponential growth equation, the graph will have an upward curve like this one. The y-intercept of</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">the graph shows the initial value, which in this example is $100. Note that the graph is NOT linear. Even though the growth rate remains constant at 8%, the annual increase</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">in the amount of money in the account will not be the same. In the first year, the $100 grows by 8%, which is</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">$8, so the final amount in the account at the end of year 1 is $108. For the second year, the money is growing at 8% but the starting value is now $108, so the amount of money will increase by 8% of $108, which is $8.64. This explains why a constant rate of change does NOT lead to a constant amount of change and why exponential graphs are not linear.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 260</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Exponential Growth and Decay</h3>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 1: Julia estimates that the numbers of bees in a hive increases by 30% every month. If Julia</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">buys a hive with 50 bees, which of the following properly models Julia’s estimate for how many bees, 5, will live in the hive in m months?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">B=50+30m</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B.

B=50(1.3)TM</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: The initial number of bees in the colony is 50, and the growth rate is 30%. Since the growth is 30% each month and not a fixed numerical value, we have exponential growth and not linear growth. A, which is linear, and C, which is quadratic, are incorrect. The value in the parentheses must be 1.3 and not 0.3 since the</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">growth rate is 30%. The 1.3 comes from the (1 + 0.3) in the growth equation. The answer is D.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Exponential Decay Now let’s consider an example of exponential decay. A new car purchased for $20,000 loses 10% of its value each year after the purchase date.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A = 20,000(1 — 0.1)°</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A = 20,000(0.9)</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The $20,000 is the initial value, and the 10% is the rate of decay. 10% can be expressed as 0.1 in decimal form, so we get a value of 0.9 inside the parentheses. A represents the current value after ¢ time intervals. Now, let’s see how this exponential decay equation appears on a graph.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">“\\</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">“ymel</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">|</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">RS</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">are</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Again, note that the graph is NOT linear. The car continues to lose 10% of its value each year, but the</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">numerical decrease in the car’s value is not the same every year. Anytime we have an exponential decay equation, the graph will have a downward curve like this one. The y-intercept of the graph shows the initial</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">value, which in this example is the purchase price of $20,000.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 2: The Santa Barbara Newspaper is losing subscribers at a rate of 12% per year.

The 12% decrease can be expressed as 0.12 and, since we asked to find the number of subscribers in 2 years, t = 2.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Subscribers = 24,000(1 — 0.12)? = 24,000(0.88)* = 18,585.6 The question says, “closest to,” so we are not going to see the exact value in the answer choices. We need to pick the answer closest to the value of 18,585.6.

The a and b values are constants.

Write an equation that</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">models the size of the population, P(x), in x years. P(x) = 150(2)* The initial Rhino population is 150, so a = 150. The population is doubling every year, so the rate of change, b,is 2. x represents the number of years.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 2: After a lake is polluted, the population of fish in the lake follow exponential decay. A</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">survey finds that one third of the fish in the lake survived after 1 month. If the estimated initial</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">population of fish in the lake was 12,000, write an equation that models the number of fish, F(x), in m months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">F(x) = 12,000 (=)</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">m</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The initial population of fish in the lake is 12,000, so a = 12,000. The population is one third of its starting</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">value after 1 month so b = = m represents the number of months. Graphing General Exponential Form (Bonus Topic) The ACT can include questions where you need to know how to graph exponential equations, but these are rare and you are unlikely to see it on test day.

For the graph on the left, a = 1, so the y-intercept is at (0,1). The equation y = 2* is the same as y = (1)2*, so we do not see the 1 in the equation. For the graph on the right, a = 2, so the y-intercept is at (0, 2).</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Advanced Exponential Growth and Decay Equations (Bonus Topic) The exponential growth and decay equations that we learned at the beginning of this lesson are the simplified versions. The ACT very rarely includes questions for which you need to know the compound exponential growth and decay equations listed below. This topic is rarely tested and advanced, so you should only worry about this if you are aiming for top ACT Math scores.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Compound Growth:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">P = initial value</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">A=P(1+ - yn</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">A = current value r = rate of the growth or decay</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Compound Decay:</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A=P(1--)\"</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">¢ = time interval</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">n = number of times compounded per time interval</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Compounding growth or decay equations are most commonly used for calculations involving money. We only need to use these more advanced forms of the equations when the compounding occurs multiple times within each time interval. I know that seems a bit confusing, so let’s take a look at an example to make it clearer.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 3: Rachel puts $2,000 in a savings account that has an annual interest rate of 4% and</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">compounds every 6 months. Which of the following equations correctly calculates the value of her investment in 3 years?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A. 2,000(1.04)2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B. 2,000(1.04)®</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C. 2,000 (1 +*)</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D. 2,000 (1 +°)</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">6</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: Anytime an annual growth or decay rate is provided and the compounding occurs at a rate that is less than a year, we use the compound growth or decay equations. For Example 3, the compounding occurs every 6 months and the interest rate is annual, so we must use the compound growth equation shown above. Since the compounding occurs 2 times per year (there are 2 6-month periods each year), n = 2. The initial</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">value is $2,000, so P = 2,000. The rate of growth is 4%, so r = 0.04. We are finding the investment value in 3 years, sot = 3. Plugging all of these values into the compound growth equation, we get:</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">. “</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Value in 3 Years = 2,000 (1 + ></p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">0.04 6</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">= 2,000 (1 + —)</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The answer is D.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">If the question had no compounding and the investment just had an annual interest rate of 4%, we would use the simpler equations we learned at the start of this chapters and the correct answer would be A. Again, this topic is very rarely tested on the ACT, but it has been on the test before and is fair game. You should memorize both forms of the exponential growth and decay equations we learned in this lesson if you are aiming for top math scores.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 263</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>",

For most questions on the ACT, we use the simpler form of the exponential growth and decay equations shown</p>\n\n  <p>below:</p>\n\n  <p>Growth:</p>\n\n  <p>A=P(1+r)!</p>\n\n  <p>Decay:</p>\n\n  <p>A=P(i-r)é</p>\n\n  <p>P = initial value</p>\n\n  <p>A = current value</p>\n\n  <p>r = rate of the growth or decay t = time interval</p>\n\n  <p>We use the simple form of the equation above when the time interval is in years, which is most common on the ACT. At the end of this lesson, we will introduce you to the more complex form just in case it appears on your ACT.</p>\n\n  <p>Exponential Growth To see how these equations work and appear on a graph, let’s examine the equation for a bank account that has</p>\n\n  <p>an initial balance of $100 and an 8% annual interest rate.</p>\n\n  <p>A= 100(1 + 0.08)*</p>\n\n  <p>A = 100(1.08)¢</p>\n\n  <p>The $100 is the initial value, and the 8% is the growth rate. 8% is expressed as 0.08 in decimal form, so we get a value of 1.08 inside the parentheses. A represents the current value after ¢ time intervals. Since the amount of money in the bank account is increasing at a non-linear rate over time, we have exponential growth.</p>\n\n  <p>Now, let’s see how this exponential growth equation appears on a graph.</p>\n\n  <p>‘</p>\n\n  <p>aA</p>\n\n  <p>€&</p>\n\n  <p>For any exponential growth equation, the graph will have an upward curve like this one. The y-intercept of</p>\n\n  <p>the graph shows the initial value, which in this example is $100. Note that the graph is NOT linear. Even though the growth rate remains constant at 8%, the annual increase</p>\n\n  <p>in the amount of money in the account will not be the same. In the first year, the $100 grows by 8%, which is</p>\n\n  <p>$8, so the final amount in the account at the end of year 1 is $108. For the second year, the money is growing at 8% but the starting value is now $108, so the amount of money will increase by 8% of $108, which is $8.64. This explains why a constant rate of change does NOT lead to a constant amount of change and why exponential graphs are not linear.</p>\n\n</div>",

For every value of x, there is exactly one value of f(x). For any function, there will be an input, which appears as the term in the parentheses of a function, and an output, which will be the value that f(x) equals.</p>\n<div class=\"diagram-box\" style=\"text-align: center; margin: 1.5rem 0; padding: 1rem; background-color: #f8faff;\">\n    <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Linearity.svg\" alt=\"Function graph example\" style=\"max-width: 400px; height: auto;\" />\n    <p style=\"font-size: 0.9rem; color: #666; margin-top: 0.5rem;\">\n        <em>A function maps each input to exactly one output</em>\n    </p>\n</div>\n\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Function Basics In order to solve functions questions on the ACT, we first need to know where to properly plug in the input to a function. For the function</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">fx) =5x-2 we plug in the input for x. You are likely used to the input being a number, but the input can include variables</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">as well. No matter what the input is, we plug it in for the x in the equation:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">f(3) =5(3)-2=13</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">f(—2x) = 5(—2x) — 2</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">=-10x —2</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">f(a-—11) = 5(a-—11) —2=5a—57</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 1: If f(x) = 3Vx + 11, what is the value for f(25) ?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">15</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B. 26</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C. 34</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D. 64</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Solution: To solve, plug in the input to the function.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">f(25) = 3V25 4-11 = 3(5) +11 =154+11 = 26 The answer is B.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 2: A function, f, is defined by f(x,y) = 4x — y?.

A composite function is a function that is written inside of another function. We will use the examples below to learn how to solve composite functions questions correctly.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 4: If f(x) = 3x + 10 and g(x) = x — 5, what is the value of f(g(8)) ?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B. 9</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">19</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D. 29</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: If you are asked to solve a composite function, there are two methods to solve: (1) solve for the composite function or (2) work inside out. Both methods are shown below.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Method #1 - Solve for the composite function: In this question, we want to solve for the function f(g(x)). To do so, we plug the entire g(x) function in for the x in the f(x) function.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">f(g(x)) = 3( -—5) +10 = 3x-15+4+10 = 3x-5</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Now that we know the composite function f ( g (x)) = 3x — 5, we can plug in 8 for x and solve. f(g(8)) = 3(8)</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">-5 =24-5=19</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The answer is C.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Method #2 - Work inside out: Rather than solve for the composite function, we can also work from the</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">inside out to solve for</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">f(g(8)). To start, we can solve for g(8). g(8) = 8-5=3</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We now know that g(8) = 3, so we can simplify the function we are solving for.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">f(g(8)) =f) Now, we just solve for f(3).</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">f(3) = 38) +10=19 The answer is C.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Both of these methods work for any composite function questions on the ACT, so you should use the one that you are more comfortable with.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 5: If f(x) = 2x? — 7 and g(x) = x + 3, what is f(g(x —1))?</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">A. 2x? +2</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">2x7+8x+1</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">2x*+12x+4+11</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">D. 2x2 -3</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: This question looks more difficult since we now have x — 1 as the input, but we should still treat this as a composite function. Both of the methods outlined in Example 4 will work to solve. Below, we will</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">use the inside out method. First, we can solve for g(x — 1):</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">g(x—-1) =(*-1)+3=x+2</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We now know that g(x — 1) = x + 2, so we can simplify what we are solving for.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">f(g@-1)) =f +2) Now, we solve for f(x + 2).</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">f(«+2) =2(« +2)? -—7 = 2007 4+4x44)-7 = 2x7 4+8x4+8-7 = 2x74+8x41</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 90</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Functions</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">f(g(x —1)) = 2x?+8x+1 The answer is B.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">**Common Mistake to Avoid: Remember that (x + 2)? # x* + 4. You need to multiply out the term because (x + 2)? is the same as (x + 2)(x + 2).</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Other Function Notations Do you know what (f ° g)(x) or (fg)(x) means? If not, you are not alone. Most students we work with see these other function notations and are confused about what to do. No need to worry though! All of the other function notations that can come up on test day are in the table below. If you memorize what these notations mean, you will be prepared to solve any questions with them on test day.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Operation</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Function Notation</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Composite</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Fe g)(x) = f(g)</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Sum</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Ff + 9)(x) = f@) + g(x)</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Difference</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Ff -— g9)(x%) = f@) -— 9g)</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Product</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(Fax) = Fe g9)(x) = FX) x g(x)</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Quotient</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">@ (x) = ~</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 6: If f(x) = 2x? + 1 and g(x) = x? — 1, which of the following expressions represents</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(fa)(x)?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">3x?</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">B. 2x?2-1</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">C. 2x*-1</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">D. 2x*-x?-1</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: (fg)(x) is the same as f(x) x g(x), so we need to multiply the functions together.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(fg) (x) = (2x? + 1I)(x* — 1) To solve, we need to multiply these quadratics together by FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last).

These are challenging to solve and normally appear in the last 10 questions of the test.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">To solve this question, we first need to remember that (f ° g)(x) = f(g(x)). We also know that g(x) = 2x + 1, so we can plug in 2x + 1 for g(x) and get</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(fog) (x) = f(g@)) = f(x +1)</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">9]</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The input of 2x + 1 is plugged in for x in the function f(x) we are trying to find. Since we know that</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Cf</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">°g)(x) = (2x + 1)? — 3, we can replace 2x + 1 with x to work backwards and find f(x). We get</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">f(x) =x? -3.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Now that we know f (x), we can find (g ° f)(x). Again, remember that (g ° f)(x) is the same as g( f (x)). To solve, we need to plug f (x), which is x* — 3, into g(x)</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">— 3) = 2(x? —3)+1=2x?-5 (g°f)() = g(f(x)) = g(x?</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The answer is B.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Functions on Graphs When a function is graphed, the input, x, is on the x-axis and the output, f(x), is on the y-axis. Another way to better understand how functions appear on a graph is to remember that for any linear function</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">f(x)=mx+b</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">isthesameas</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">y=mx+b</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">When graphing a function f(x), you can think of f(x) as the y-coordinate and x as the x-coordinate. Using</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">the input as x and the output as y, we can find points in the standard (x, y) plane and graph any function.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 8:</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">7</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">i</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">\\</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">\\</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">\\</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">La</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">(NAS</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">an,</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">[| \\</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">fl</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">2o0n</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">[</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">fo</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">|\\</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">—— |</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">~aJ</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"><<</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">nN</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The function f(x) is shown in the standard (x, y) coordinate plane above.

Well, now we just look for the highest point on the graph, which is at y = 6. Easy right? For any questions asking for the minimum or maximum value of a function, you just need to look</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">at the graph and find the smallest or largest y-value.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">-92</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Functions</h3>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 9:</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">ariamieie</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">WEA</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The function f(x) = 4 cos(7x) + 1 is graphed in the standard (x, y) coordinate plane above.

We see the function crossing the x-axis 4 times, so the answer is D.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Domain and Range Another common type of common functions question will ask you about the domain or range of a function. e</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Domain: The set of all possible input, x, values to a function.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">e</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Range: The set of all output, y, values to a function.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">If you are looking at the graph of a function, the domain is all the x-values that appear on the graph and the range is all the y-values that appear on the graph.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">To see how this works, let’s find the domain and range of the graph below.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We see x-values on the graph from x = —1 to x = 3, so for the graph above the domain is {-1 < x < 3}. Since the dots on the graph are solid, we include —1 and 3 in the domain and use the less than or equal to and greater than or equal to signs. If the dots were open, the domain would instead use the greater than and less</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">than signs and would be {—1 < x < 3}. . We see y-values on the graph from y = —2 to y = 4, so for the graph above the range is {—2 < y < 4}.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 93</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 10:</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The graph of f(x) = 3sin(27x) — 3 is shown above.

We see y-values from y = —6 to y = 0, so the range of f(x) is -—6 < y <0. The answer is A.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 11:</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The graph f(x) =</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">A. fyly #1}</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(x—4)(x-2) (x—-1)(x-2)</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">is shown above.

We call this a horizontal asymptote at y = 1. Because there are no points on the graph where y = 1, the range of the function will not include y = 1. All points above the horizontal asymptotes y = 1 appear on the graph, but what about below?</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Do you see that open dot at the point (2,—2)? We call this point a hole in the graph. Holes occur when the</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">numerator and denominator of a function both equal 0. If we plug in x = 2 to f(x), we will get f(2) = =. We can also spot that there is going to be a hole at x = 2 because we see (x — 2) in the numerator and denominator. When the same term appears in the numerator and denominator, it always creates a hole. Holes in the graph are undefined and are never included in the domain. But a hole does not automatically mean the value is not included in the range, as there could be another point with the y-value elsewhere on the graph. In the graph above, however, there is no point where y = 2, so it is also not included in the range. As a result, we see that the function includes all y-values except at y = 1 (the horizontal asymptote) and</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">y = —2 (the hole). In fancy math terms, this would appear as {y|y # —2 and y ¥ 1}, which means all values of y except y = —2 and y = 1. The answer is C. Horizontal asymptotes are rarely tested on the ACT, but you should still know how to solve for them just in case. If you need to review asymptotes, the rules for solving them are covered in Lesson.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">~ 94</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Functions</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Continuing to look at the graph in Example 11, you can see there is a vertical invisible line at x = 1 that the graph approaches but never crosses. There is no point on the graph when x = 1. We call this a vertical asymptote at x = 1. Because there is no point on the graph where x = 1, the domain of the function will not include x = 1. We will also cover the rules for vertical asymptotes in Lesson. There is also an open dot at x = 2. We call this point a hole in the graph. Holes are not included in the domain since there 1s no point where x = 2 on the graph. All other values for x appear on the graph, so the</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">domain is all values of x except x # 1 and x # 2. Mathematically, the domain could be written as</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">{x|x # 1 and x # 2}. Vertical asymptotes occur when the denominator of a function is equal to 0. If we plug in x = 1 to</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">f(x), we get f(1) = =, which is undefined. Again, since vertical asymptotes are points where the function is undefined, they are never included in the domain. What if you are not given a picture graph in the question? To solve for vertical asymptotes, you set the denominator equal to zero and solve. If there is a hole in the graph, such as the one at x = 2 in example 11, we cancel those terms. So for the graph in example 11, the only term left in the denominator is x — 1. To find the vertical asymptote, we set x — 1 equal to 0 and solve. x—-1=0 x=1</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We see there is a vertical asymptote at x = 1. Even if we were not given the graph, we could easily solve for any vertical asymptotes. Remember vertical asymptotes are points where the graph is undefined and are not included in the domain.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 12: The domain of f(x) = —— is the set of all real numbers EXCEPT:</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B. —3</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">C. 2 and</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">D. —2 and</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: Whenever you are asked about the domain and see a fraction in a function, look for where the function is undefined. To make the function undefined, set the denominator equal to 0 and solve for x.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x*—5x+6=0 (x —2)(x-—3)=0 x=2,3</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">f(x) is undefined when x = 2 and x = 3, so these points are not included in the domain of the function. If we graphed f(x), we would see vertical asymptotes at x = 2 and x = 3. The answer is C.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 13: Two real-valued functions are defined as f(x) = Vx + 1 and g(x) = x — 3.

Values underneath a square root must be greater than or equal to 0. Any value of x that makes the term underneath the square root negative cannot be included in the domain. To find the domain with a square root, set the term underneath the square root greater than or equal to zero and solve for x. x—-32>0</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">95</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x>3</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The domain of f(g(x)) is x = 3. Written in interval notation, this is [ 3,00). The answer is B.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">To illustrate why the domain is restricted, let’s plug in x = 1, which is not part of the domain, to f(g(x)) and see what happens.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">f(gQ)) =v1-34+1= V-24+1 You cannot have a negative term underneath the square root, so x = 1 has no real number output and therefore cannot be included in the domain. If you need to review vertical and horizontal asymptotes or just want more practice, go to Lesson.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Inverse Functions Inverse functions, written as</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">f~1(x), are rarely tested on the ACT, but they are pretty easy to solve, so let’s go</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">over them just in case you see an inverse functions question on test day. To find the inverse of any function,</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">switch the input x and the output f(x) and solve for f(x). Let’s see how this works in the example below.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 14: Given the function f(x) = —<—. what is the value for f~1(6.5) ?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">7</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B-=</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C. =</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: To find the inverse, we switch the input x and the output f(x).

As you work through the rest of these lessons, use these techniques whenever you can to solve questions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Backsolving is plugging the answer choices back into the question. On the ACT, you are given 4 answer choices for multiple choice questions, and one of those 4 choices must be correct. Rather than solving the question algebraically and determining whether your answer matches one of the answer choices, you can guess-and-check with the answer choices to find which one is correct. Backsolving is often the fastest and easiest way to solve ACT questions, especially if you get stuck and cannot solve a question algebraically, so use it to your advantage.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Backsolving can be done using five steps:</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Start with B or C. Plug the value in the answer choice back into the question. The answer choices are always in order of smallest to largest or largest to smallest so starting in the middle saves you time.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solve the question using this value. Find any other unknowns if necessary.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">If this answer choice works correctly, you’re done! Bubble it in and move on.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">4.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">If this answer choice does not work, cross it off. If you know the correct answer needs to be smaller or larger than the value you just tried, cross off any other incorrect answers.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Pick one of the remaining answer choices and plug it back into the question. Repeat this until</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">you find the correct answer. Remember, one of the 5 answer choices must work!</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 1: If Vx + 10 — 2Vx — 2 = 0, what is the value of x?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A. 2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B. 6</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">14</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">18</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: The quickest and easiest way to solve this question is backsolving. Finding the correct answer is just a process of guess-and-check. Below, you can see how the correct answer B, when x = 6, makes the equation be true.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">V6+10—2V6—-—2=0</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">V16 —2V4 =0</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">4—2(2)</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">= 0</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">4—-4=0</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">0=0</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The answer is B. If we plug in any of the other answer choices, we will get an equation that is not equal on</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">both sides and is incorrect.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 2: Which of the following is a solution to the equation of x? + 5x? + 6x =0?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A)</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">-3</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B)-1</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">©1</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">D)j2</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: Most students look at this question and think, “Oh no, I need to factor this to solve.” However, the easiest way to solve this question is backsolving! We plug the answer choices into the equation to see which one makes it equal 0. Below, you can see how the correct answer, when x = —3, makes the equation be true.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">(—3)? + 5(—3)? + 6(-3) = 0</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">—27+45-18=0</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">0=0</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The answer is A.

For this method, we will use the point(s) to test which equation works correctly. Remember, if a point is on a graph, it must make the equation of the graph true.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 3: A linear function f passes through the points (1,5), (3,9), and (7,17).

Answer choices C and D</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">both work, so we need to use a second point to test answer choices C and D. Let’s use the point (3, 9).</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">For answer choice C: f(3) = 4(3)</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">+1.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">f()=13 =</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(Cis incorrect.)</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">For answer choice D: f(3) = 2(3)+3.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">f()=9 ~~ (Discorrect.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The answer is D.

Negative and odd</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">C. Positive andeven</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">D. Positive and odd</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: Method #1 — Substitution. The easiest way to solve this question is to use substitution and pick numbers form and n. As long as we follow the rules in the question (m is positive and even, n is negative and odd), we can pick any numbers. It is best to pick small numbers to make the algebra easier. Let’s pick m = 2 and n = —3. Now, we can plug our values for m and n into the equation and solve for p.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">mn? + 3m =p</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">2(—3)? + 3(2) =p 2(9)+6=p 18+6=p 24=p</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">With our values, we got p = 24, which is a positive, even number, so we can see that C is correct. No matter what numbers we select, as long as we follow the rules outlined in the question, p will always be positive and even.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Method #2 — Rules of Even and Odd Numbers. We can also solve this question conceptually by using our rules for odd and even numbers in the table above.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Let’s start by figuring out if p will be positive or negative. For the mn? term, m > 0 and n? > 0 (since squared terms are always positive). A positive number multiplied by a positive number is always positive, so</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">mn? > 0. Sincem > 0,3m > 0. Since both mn? and 3m are positive, the sum of those terms will be positive. p is positive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Next, let’s find out if p is odd or even. Let’s start with the mn? term. We know that m is even, but what about n7? n is odd, so n? is odd x odd, which is odd. So, mn? is even x odd, which is even. 3m is also going to</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 62</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Number Theory</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">be even, since 3m is odd x even, which is even. As a result, we see that mn? + 3m is even + even, which is even. p is even. Using our rules for even and odd numbers, we find that p is positive and even. C is the correct answer. *Note: Solving questions like Example 3 conceptually is often much more difficult and time-consuming, so we always recommend using substitution for questions like this if you can.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Greatest Common Factor The greatest common factor of a set of numbers is the largest positive integer that divides evenly into all numbers in the set with no remainder. For example, for the set of numbers 12, 18, and 30, the greatest</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">common factor is 6. 6 is the largest number that divides evenly into 12, 18, and 30.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 4: What is the greatest common factor for the set of numbers 56, 112, 182?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A. 2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B. 8</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">14</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D. 28</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: The easiest way to solve any greatest common factor question with numbers is to backsolve</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">using the answer choices. We are looking for the largest number that divides evenly into 56, 112, and 182. To solve, all we need to do is grab a calculator and start with the largest value in the answer choices, which is</p>\n\n<ol class=\"instruction-list\">\n<li>28 divides evenly into 56 and 112 but does not divide evenly into 182, so 28 is incorrect. 14 divides</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">evenly into 56, 112, and 182, as we can see below:</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">56+14=4</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">112+14=8</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">182+14=13</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The correct answer is C. 8 does not divide evenly into 182. 2 divides evenly into all 3 numbers but 2 is smaller than 14, so 2 is not the greatest common factor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">For more advanced greatest common factor questions, the ACT can ask you to find the greatest common factor for an expression with variables. For these questions, we are looking for the largest term that we can factor out from all other terms. For a simple example to start, let’s consider the expression</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">3x2 + 6x</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The greatest factor is 3x, because we can factor our 3x from both the 3x? term and the 6x term. If we factor 3x from 3x7, we have x left over. If we factor 3x from 6x, we have 2 left over. We can rewrite the expression above as</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">3x(x + 2) to show the greatest common factor, 3x, factored out from the original expression.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 5: What is the greatest monomial factor for the expression 3x?y — 12x? ?</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">A. 3x3</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">B. 3x?</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">C. 12x?y</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">D. x</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: To find the greatest monomial factor (monomial factor is just a fancy algebra word for an algebraic expression with only one term), we need to find the largest number and variable(s) that we can factor out from both terms. Let’s start with the number. What is the largest number that we can factor out from both terms? The answer is 3 because both 3 and 12 are divisible by 3.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 63</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">What about the variables? To factor out a variable, the variable must appear in all terms in the expression.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Since y only appears in the 3x?y term and not in the —12x term, we cannot factor y out from both terms. Okay, so what about x? Ifa variable appears in all terms in the expression, we can factor out the lowest</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">power. The first term, 3x*y, has x? while the second term, —12x?, has x2. The lowest power is x2, so we can factor out an x”.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Combining the number, 3, and variable, x’, that we factored out, we find the greatest monomial factor is 3x?. We can rewrite the original expression as</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">3x2 (xy — 4) to show the greatest monomial factor factored out from the original expression. The correct answer is B.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Least Common Multiple The least common multiple is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all numbers in the set. For</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">example, the least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6 because 6 is the smallest number that is divisible by both 2 and 3. A multiple of a number is when we multiply that number by another number. For example, the multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and so on. Any positive number that is divisible by 41s a multiple of 4.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 6: What is the least common multiple for 5, 6, and 20?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A. 20</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B. 30</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C. 60</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">120</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: To find the least common multiple, we can list the multiples of 5, 6, and 20 and look for the smallest number that appears on all 3 lists.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Multiples of 5:</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5,10, 15,20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50,55, 60, 65, 70...</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Multiples of 6:</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">6,12, 18,24, 30, 36,42, 48, 54, 60, 66...</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Multiples of 20:</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">20,40, 60,80...</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We see the least common multiple is 60. While 120 and 3,000 are divisible by 5, 6, and 20, they are not the smallest number that is a multiple of all 3 and therefore not the least common multiple. The answer is C. Shortcut Solution: The fastest and easiest way to solve is to backsolve using the answer choices. We do not recommend using the method above. However, it is important to understand the method above, as you may need to use that method for other types of least common multiple questions. To solve, grab your calculator, start with answer choice A, and see if the number is divisible by 5, 6, and 8. Here, 20 is not divisible by 6, so we would next try 30. 30 is not divisible by 20, so we would move on to 60. 60 is divisible by all 5,6, and 20, so we know we found the answer. We are looking for the least common</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">multiple, so there is no need to even check any larger numbers once you find an answer choice that works.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 64</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Number Theory</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Prime Factorization Prime factorization is a method of expressing a number as a product of its prime factors. The most</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">common approach to prime factorization is making a factor tree. In the factor tree, we keep dividing numbers and creating more branches until we are left with only prime numbers. Let’s start by finding the prime factorization of 20.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">20</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">\\</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Prime Factorization of 20</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">,0</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">20=2x2x5</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">aa</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The prime factors (2, 2, and 5) are shown in bold. To show the prime factorization of 20, we multiply all the prime factors together, so the prime factorization of 20 is 2 x 2 x 5.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 7: Which of the following is the correct prime factorization of 6,006?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A. 2:3:+7:11:13</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B.6:7-:11:13</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C. 6:7:143</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D. 7-11-13</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Solution: To solve, we can set up a factor tree for 6,006.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">6,006</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3,003</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Prime Factorization of 6,006</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a \\</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">6,006 =2x3x7x11x13</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1,001</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">7</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">143</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">xs The dots in the answer choices are another way in math to show multiplication. From our factor tree, we see the prime factors (shown in bold on the factor tree) are 2, 3, 7, 11, and 13. The answer is A. All the other answer choices are incompletely factored or do not multiply to 6,006. In B and C, 6 is nota prime number. In D, 7+ 11-13 does not multiply to 6,006.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The prime factorization shown above is only one example of a correct factor tree. Depending on the numbers you divide by to start, you factor tree may look a bit different than the one above. For example, the first branches from 6,006 could be 6 and 1,001. No matter how you start the tree, you will get the same prime factorization as long as you do the math correctly and continue to divide the branches of the tree until you get only prime numbers.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">-65</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">One Solution vs. Infinite Solutions vs. No Solution We need to know how to tell when an algebraic expression will have one solution, infinite solutions, and no solution. To start, let’s see how a question testing you on this topic might appear on the ACT.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 8: For the equation 3x — 8 = ax — 12, under which condition will there be no solution?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a=0</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">B.a=3</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">C.ax#3</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a>0O</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Before we come back to solve Example 8, let’s learn the rules for one solution, infinite solutions, and no solution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">One Solution Any algebraic expression that can be solved for a single value of x will have one solution. For example, if we have the expression. 9x —2=5x+10</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">we can solve for x. Subtract 5x from both sides and add 2 to both sides to get:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">4x =12 x=3</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We get 1 solution for x. Memorize the rules below to know how to spot this quickly. Rule for 1 Solution</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The coefficients of the x-terms are different. The constants (numbers) can be the same or different.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Anytime the expression has x-terms with different coefficients and no higher powers of x, such as x?, there is always 1 solution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">In the example we just solved, the x-terms, 9x and 5x have different coefficients, so, using the rule for 1 solution, we know there will be 1 solution without having to solve the equation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Infinite Solutions An algebraic expression with infinite solutions must be true for any value of x. For an equation to have</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">infinite solutions, both sides of the equation must be identical. Some examples of equations with infinite</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">solutions are below:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">6x —12 = 6x-12</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">7x? = 7x?</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x9—4*%4+5=x°-4x4+5</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">For the expressions above, we can plug any value for x and the expression will be true. Rule for Infinite Solutions</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Both sides of the equation must be identical. The coefficients of the x-terms and the constants</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(numbers) must be the same. Anytime both sides of the expression are identical, any value of x makes the expression true, so there are infinite solutions.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 66</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Number Theory</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">No Solution An algebraic expression with no solution cannot be solved for any value of x. For this to occur, the expression must have the same coefficients for the variable(s) on both sides and the constants (numbers)</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">must be different. Some examples of equations with no solution are below:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x-2=x4+5</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">6x —12=6x+4+1</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">7x? = 7x* +10</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">No matter what value we plug in for x, we can never make any of the equations above true. Notice that the</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">terms with variables (the terms with x or x? in the above examples) are equal but the numbers are not. Anytime an equation looks like this, there is no solution. Rule for No Solution</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The coefficients of the x-terms are the same. The constants (numbers) are different. Anytime we see these characteristics in an algebraic expression, there is no solution. Now that we know the rules, let’s go back to Example 8.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 8: For the expression 3x — 8 = ax — 12, under which condition will there be no solution?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a=0</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a=3</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">C.a#3</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a>0</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: For there to be no solution, we need the coefficients of the x-terms to be the same and the constants (numbers) to be different. In the equation above, the number are already different, so we just need to make the coefficients of x-terms the same. For this to occur, we need a = 3 so the expression becomes 3x —8=3x-12</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">which has no solution. The answer is B.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Two Solutions for Algebraic Expressions For a challenge question, the ACT can also include an algebraic expression that has two solutions. For an</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">algebraic expression to have 2 solutions, the equation must either (1) have an x*-term or (2) have an x-term inside absolute value bars.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Two Solutions with an x2-term Let’s say we are given the algebraic expression x* — 6 = —2. To solve, we could add 6 to both sides and get</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x? =4 Taking the square root of both sides we get. x=+2</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">So, we get 2 solutions! Remember that in Lesson (pg. 56) we learned that when we take the square root</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">of both sides with x2, we must put a + in front of the number. Two Solutions with Absolute Value Let’s say we are given the expression |x| + 3 = 10. To solve, we subtract 3 from both sides and get Ix} =7</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">></h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x=7 and x=-7</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">When we have a variable inside the absolute value bars, there will be 2 solutions.

Ratios do not give the exact number of items but instead allow us to concisely compare the relationship between two things at the same time. As an example, if we have oranges and apples in a basket in the ratio of 2:3, it does not necessarily mean that we have 2 oranges and 3 apples. Instead, the ratio tells us that for every 2 oranges, there are 3 apples. Asa result, you can think of this ratio as 2x: 3x because we must multiply 2 and 3 by the same value to keep the 2:3 ratio. Using this “x” trick will help you on many ratio questions where you are given a ratio but not any</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">exact numbers. On the ACT, you will need to solve ratio questions in four different ways. We will review the four types of</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">ratio questions below along with the methods you should use to solve them:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">#1 - Ratio and a Total</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 1: The ratio of red marbles to green marbles in a bag 1s 4:6.

We can think of the ratio 4:6 as 4x: 6x, where the 4x represents the red marbles and the 6x represents the green marbles. Red Marbles + Green Marbles = 80 4x + 6x = 80 10x</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">= 80</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x=8</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">To solve for the red marbles, we plug x = 8 back into the 4x.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Red Marbles = 4x = 4(8) = 32 The answer is C.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Method #2: Set up a Proportion.

    "reformattedContent": "<div class=\"lesson-content\">\n  <h2>Ratios and Proportions</h2>\n\n  <p>Ratios We use ratios to make comparisons between two things. Ratios do not give the exact number of items but instead allow us to concisely compare the relationship between two things at the same time. As an example, if we have oranges and apples in a basket in the ratio of 2:3, it does not necessarily mean that we have 2 oranges and 3 apples. Instead, the ratio tells us that for every 2 oranges, there are 3 apples. Asa result, you can think of this ratio as 2x: 3x because we must multiply 2 and 3 by the same value to keep the 2:3 ratio. Using this “x” trick will help you on many ratio questions where you are given a ratio but not any</p>\n\n  <p>exact numbers.

To</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">answer these questions, consider the event that you are counting and compare it to the total number of possible outcomes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">To learn how probability works, let’s work through a few questions with the following example:</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 1: A bag has a total of 38 chocolate candies. 18 of the candies are blue, 10 are red, 5 are</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">yellow, 3 are green, and 2 are pink.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Question 1: Andy will reach into the bag and pick one candy.

Therefore, the probability</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">of selecting a yellow candy is = The answer is C. Question 2: Evelyn is going to pick one piece of chocolate candy from the bag. What is the probability that she will NOT pick a blue candy?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">9</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">=</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">19</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">10</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">19</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">9</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Cc. —</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">38</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">10</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">38</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: There is a total of 18 blue candies in the bag, which means there are 20 candies that are not blue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The probability of selecting a chocolate candy that is not blue is =, which simplifies to = The answer is B. Pretty easy, right? Now, these questions get a bit more difficult when you have probabilities that involve multiple events. It is important to remember that with multiple events, we multiply the probabilities of each individual event together. Make sure that you remember to multiply fractions and not add them, as the most common mistake students make 1s incorrectly adding the fractions when you are supposed to multiply.

Rule #1 — The sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes is equal to 1.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">For example, let’s think of a flipping a coin. The probability of flipping a head is =, and the probability of flipping a tail is = Of course, = + - = 1. All coin flips must end in a head or a tail, so the sum of the probabilities of those events must equal 1.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 3: In aclass of fifth graders, students were asked to pick their favorite lunch, and no student</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">was allowed to select more than one lunch as their favorite: - picked pizza, - picked chicken nuggets, — picked pasta, and = picked tacos.

These very commonly appear at the end of the math test in questions 30-45. There is a high likelihood you will see one of these questions on test day! We will cover how to solve the most common types in the following examples.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 8: A fair spinner with 5 equally sized regions and an arrow has regions numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, and</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">5 respectively. A second fair spinner with 3 equally sized regions and an arrow has regions numbered 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The arrows are both spun at the same time and the numbers the two arrows land on are added together.

Let’s start by finding the total number of possible outcomes. The first spinner has 5 possible outcomes while the second spinner has 3 possible outcomes. To find the total number of possible outcomes, we multiply</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">lst spinner</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">2nd spinner</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Total</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Outcomes</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Outcomes</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Outcomes</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">That’s the easy part. Now for the hard part. We need to find the total number of outcomes that add to an odd number. The most reliable way to do this is to find an organized way to count the outcomes and keepa tally of</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">the odd numbers. To make our tally, we will use the following rule:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Odd + Odd = Even Even + Even = Even</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Odd + Even = Odd</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">To start, let’s say the first spinner lands on a 1. The second spinner could land on a 1, 2, or 3. Of these three possible outcomes, only 1 + 2 sums up to an odd number, so we have 1 outcome in the tally. Next, let’s say the first spinner lands on a 2. The second spinner could land on a 1, 2, or 3. Of these possible outcomes, 2 + 1 and 2 + 3 add to an odd number, so we have 2 more outcomes to add to our tally (so 3 total). Now, let’s say the first spinner lands on a 3. There is going to be 1 outcome that sums to an odd number. How do we know this so quickly? Well, 1 and 3 are both odd, so we know that 3 will follow the same pattern that 1 did and will only have 1 outcome that sums to an odd number (3 + 2) We add 1 more to our tally (so 4 total). What if the first spinner lands on a 4? Since 4 is even, we can use the pattern we found for 2. There are going</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">to be 2 outcomes (4 + 1 and 4 + 3) that sum to an odd number. We add 2 more to our tally (so 6 total). Finally, if the first spinner lands on a 5, there is going to be 1 outcome (5 + 2) that sums to an odd number. We add 1 more to our tally and find that there are 7 total outcomes that sum to an odd number.

Example 8 just shows one type of question and one approach to solve, but different questions will require different approaches. A good first step is to always draw a diagram and start</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">listing outcomes. If there is a pattern, as there was in Example 8, you will be able to spot it.

However, using this simple diagram trick makes questions like this quick and easy to solve!</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Expected Value The expected value is the outcome you expect for a probability based event, like how many questions you might answer correctly if you guess on a multiply choice test. For example, if you guess randomly on a 60-question multiple-choice math test which choices A, B, C, and D, you can expect to get 25% correct (15 out of 60).</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The calculation behind this is simple: take the probability of an event occurring and multiply by the number of events.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Expected Value = P(A) x A Where P(A) is the probability that event A occurs and A is the number of times event A occurs. For our</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">multiple-choice test example, the probability of guessing an answer correctly is - and the number of questions is 60, so</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Expected Value = P(guess correctly) x number of questions = =x 60 = 15 If you guess randomly on the 60 questions, the expected number of correct answers is 15.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 11: A bag contains 12 identically sized, solid-colored balls. 3 balls are black, 5 are green, 2 are</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">blue, and 2 are yellow.

More advanced expected value questions will include multiple possible outcomes from the same event. For example, let’s say that there are four cards on the table facedown. Each card has a number written on it, which represents the amount of money the winner gets. If two cards have a 1, one card has a 3, and one card has a 11, what is the expected value of playing the game? The approach is the same as before, except that now we need to add the sum of all the expected values using the equation</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Expected Value = P(A) x A + P(B)xB+ P(C)xC... P(A) is probability that events A occurs, and A is the payout for event A. P(B) is probability that events B occurs, and B is the payout for event B, and so on for however many events there are. For our example, the probability is the likelihood of picking a card with a certain number. The payout for each event is the number</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">on the card.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">There are 2 cards with a 1, so the probability of randomly picking a card with a 1 on it is =.

    "originalContent": "<div class=\"lesson-content\">\n  <h2 class=\"lesson-title\">Lesson: Systems of Equations</h2>\n\n  <h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Systems of Equations</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">A system of equations is a set of two equations with the same set of unknowns. The ACT most commonly hides systems of equations questions in word problems. You will need to turn the word problem into two equations and then solve for one or both unknowns. Before we tackle the word problems, let’s start with how to solve a system of equations when we are given the equations. The easiest methods are elimination and substitution. You will need to be familiar with both of these methods to solve systems of equations questions correctly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Elimination We cannot solve an equation with two variables, so elimination is all about trying to eliminate one variable and get an equation with only one unknown that can be solved. To do this, we need to make the coefficients for one variable have the same value and opposite signs in the two equations. With addition, one of the variables will cancel out, leaving us an equation with just one unknown that can be solved.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 1: If 10x — 4y = 16 and 2x + 4y = 8, what is the value of y?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B. 2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C. 4</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D. 8</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: Whenever we have a system of equation where none of the variables are already isolated, “elimination” 1s the fastest way to get to the answer. Since we are asked to solve for y, we want to cancel the x-terms. To do so, we multiply the second equation by —5. 10x —4y = 16</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">—5 (2x + 4y = 8) 10x —4y = 16 —10x — 20y = —40</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Next, add the equations together and solve for y. Notice that the x-terms cancel out. —24y = —24 y=1 The answer is A.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Substitution In substitution, we want to isolate one variable in the fastest and easiest way possible. Once we have an isolated variable, we can substitute that value into the other equation and have an equation with one variable that we can solve.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 2: If 12x + 8y = 8 and y = 6x — 14, what does x equal?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">—2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C. 2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D. 7</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: If we are given a question where one of the variables is already isolated, use the “substitution” method. In this question, y is already isolated. We know that y = 6x — 14 from the second equation, so we can substitute 6x — 14 for the y in the first equation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">12x + 8(6x —14) =8 12x +48x-—112=8 60x -112 =8</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 128</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Systems of Equations</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">60x = 120 x=</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The answer is C.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Word Problems Many word problems are systems of equations questions in disguise. For these questions, the biggest challenge is turning the words into equations. If you can do that successfully, you then just need to solve the system of equations. Systems of equations questions on the ACT most commonly look something like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 3: For her garden, Mary buys 42 plants for a total of $108. Mary is only going to plant</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">tomatoes and peppers. If a tomato plant costs $3.00 and pepper plant costs $2.00, how many pepper plants did Mary buy?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">10</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">12</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">16</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">18</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: Let x be the number of tomato plants and y be the number of pepper plants. We can write two equations. The first equation comes from the fact that we know Mary bought a total of 42 plants. x+y</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">= 42</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The second equation includes the prices of each plant to add to the total amount of money Mary spent buying the 42 plants. 3x + 2y = 108</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Once we have these two equations, we can use elimination to solve. We are solving for the number of pepper plants, y, so we can eliminate the tomato plants, x, by multiplying the first equation by —3.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">—3(x+ y = 42) 3x + 2y = 108 —3x —3y = —126 3x + 2y = 108</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Next, add the equations together and solve for y. Notice that the x-terms cancel out. —y=-18 y=18 The answer is D.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">On more challenging questions, there can be more than two unknowns, and we will need to write more than 2 equations.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 4: Malik made $738 selling his artwork this month and is counting his cash. Malik only has $1,</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">$5, and $20 bills. He counts and notices that he has 5 more $5 bills than $20 bills and 6 more $1 bills than $5 bills. How many $1 bills does Malik have?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">33</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B. 38</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C. 48</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D. 53</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: Method #1 — “Math Teacher Way”: Let x be the number of $1 bills, y be the number of $5 bills, and z be the number of $20 bills. We can write three equations. First, we are told that Malik has $738. To find the total amount of money Malik has, we multiply the number of bills by the dollar amount of each bill.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Those must add up to a total of $738. 1x + 5y + 202 = 738</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 129</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We have one equation with three unknowns. Well, that looks no fun! We cannot solve an equation with three unknowns, so we need to write a few more equations with the rest of the information from the question.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We are told Malik has 5 more $5 bills than $20 bills and 6 more $1 bills than $5 bills, so the other equations are</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">zZz+5=y yt6o=x</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We are asked to solve for $1 bills, which is x, so we want to put y and z in terms of x. First, let’s use the equation y + 6 = x above to solve for y in terms of x. Subtracting 6 from both sides we get y=x-6</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Next, we need to solve for z in terms of x. To do so, we can plug in x — 6 for y in the equation z + 5 = y. Z+5=x-6 Z=x-—11</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Now that we have y and z in terms of x, we can plug these values into our first equations and solve for x. 1x +5(* — 6) + 20(x — 11) = 738 1x + 5x — 30+ 20x — 220 = 738 26x = 988 x = 38</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The answer is B. Okay...that was not easy. Good news! There is an easier way to solve questions like this.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Method 2 — Backsolve: The answer choices tell us the possible number of $1 bills. We can use the answer choices and play guess-and-check to see which one is correct. Let’s say we are going to check if answer choice B works or not.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Answer choice B says there are 38 $1 bills. If there are 6 more $1 bills than $5 bills, there would be 32 $5 bills. If there are 5 more $5 bills than $20 bills, there would be 27 $20 bills. Now, we just need to see if the</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">total is equal to $738.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">38(1) + 32(5) + 27(20) = 738</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">38 $1 bills worked to get a total of $738, so the answer is B.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">None of the other answer choices would give you $738. That’s much easier than doing all that fancy algebra, right? For questions with more than 2 unknown values, always backsolve using the answer choices.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>",

You have likely learned scientific notation before, so in this lesson we will review how to write numbers in scientific notation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">How To Write Numbers in Scientific Notation Scientific notation is always written as a product of two numbers: the digit term and the exponential</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">term. The base of the exponential term is always 10. Using our example from above, we can identify these different numbers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">15,000,000 = 1.5 x 10” The 1.5 is the digit term and the 107 is the exponential term. The digit term must always be greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">So how did we turn 15,000,000 into 1.5 x 107? It’s all about counting how many places we move the decimal point, as the number of places we move the decimal point tells us the power in the exponential term. In the original number 15,000,000, the decimal is located at the end of the number. To turn this into scientific</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">notation, we need to move the decimal between the | and the 5.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">15,000,000.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">UUW</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">= 1.5 x 107</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\"><q—__</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The decimal point moves 7 spots to the left, so the power in the exponential term is 7.

Answer choice D is incorrect because the digit term, the 25 in these answer choices, is too large. In scientific notation, the digit term must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10. Ok, so we know how to write large numbers in scientific notation. What about small numbers less than 1? We use the same approach, except now we must move the decimal point to the right.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">0.000916</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">LULL</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">—></h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">= 9.16 x 1074</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The decimal point moves 4 spots to the right, so the power in the exponential term is —4.

This is not because matrices are especially difficult; instead, it is because many students have never worked with matrices before! While matrices may seem intimidating at first, they are actually quite simple once you learn the rules for how to add, subtract, and multiply matrices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">What is a Matrix? A matrix is a rectangular arrangement of numbers into rows and columns. Matrices are useful in math because</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">they allow more complex equations to be reduced into a simpler form with fewer variables. To show you an example of what we mean, let’s see how a system of equations below can be represented in a matrix.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">10x — 3y = 40</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">[1°</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">—3</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">40)</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">4x + 8y = 18</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">4</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">8</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">18</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">th x yy constants</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">As you can see, the system of equations can be represented by numbers in the matrix. The easiest type of matrix question on the ACT could ask you to understand this concept.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Matrix Dimensions The dimensions of a matrix refer to the number of rows and number of columns in the matrix. Matrix dimensions are written as (rows X columns). You can also think of this as (height x width). The examples below show you some matrices of various dimensions.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">(2x1):[*]</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">(2x2): [73 fey</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">(1x3): [10 1 9]</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">ACT questions do not ask directly about matrix dimensions, but we need to understand matrix dimensions for the other topics that we will learn in this lesson.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Matrix Addition and Subtraction Matrix addition and subtraction is just simple arithmetic. Using matrices with the same dimensions, you complete the arithmetic for each position in the matrix. Take a look at the example below to see how it’s done!</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">[ 7|+ [“ i” ~ . 5 Top Left. -5+10=5</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Top Right:</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Bottom Left: —1+(—5) = -6</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">4+ 7= 11</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Bottom Right: 7 +(—2) = 5</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">To solve for top left position, use the values in the top left. The top left of the first matrix, —5, plus the top left in the second matrix, 10, gives us the value in the top left of the resulting matrix 5. We repeat this process for all other spots in the matrix to solve for the entire matrix.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 1: In the matrices shown below, what is the value of a + b ?</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">OS he D8 g)=</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">(3</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C. —2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D. —5</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D. —8</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 178</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Matrices</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: To find a + b, we need to find the values of a and b. Let’s start with a. To find a, we need to look at the values in the top night position. We can see that 14+a=9</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solving this equation by subtracting 14 from both sides, we find a=-5 To find b, we look at values in the bottom left position.

All other topics for matrices are “advanced” and almost always appear somewhere in questions 30-45. While these topics are “advanced,” many matrices questions are not too difficult once you know the rules for how to solve them. The rest of this lesson will cover the more “advanced” topics that commonly appear on the ACT and how to solve them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Finding the Determinant of a (2 X 2) Matrix On the ACT, you need to know how to find the determinant of a (2 X 2) matrix. The determinant of a matrix is just a property of a matrix. All you need to know about the determinant is how to find it in case the ACT asks you a question about it. Determinant questions are generally not very difficult as long as you memorize</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">the formula below:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Fora(2 xX 2) matrix \\@</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">A , the determinant = ad — bc</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">To find the determinant, all you need to do is multiply top left (a) x bottom right (d) and subtract top right (b) X bottom left (c). To show you how this works with numbers, let’s use the matrix below.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">—6</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">12</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">To find the determinant, we plug the values from the matrix into the equation ad — bc:</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Determinant = (2)(12) — (—6)(3)</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">= (24) — (—18)</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">= 24+ 18</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Determinant = 42</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">On the ACT, a determinant question could be that simple! However, the ACT more commonly includes a variable as show in Example 3.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 3: The determinant of matrix B is equal to 10. What is the value of x?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">—4</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">‘|</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">B=[% x</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A. —4</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B. —-1</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C. 0</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D. 4</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: To solve for x, we need to set up the determinant equation and solve for x. We are told that the determinant of matrix B is equal to 10, so the determinant equation is</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">—4(x) — 6(1) = 10 —4x —6= 10 —4x</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">= 16</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x=-4 The answer is A.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Determinant questions appear occasionally on the ACT. However, the far more commonly tested “advanced” matrix questions involve matrix multiplication, which we will learn next.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 180</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Matrices</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Matrix Multiplication The most common type of “advanced” matrix question on the ACT is matrix multiplication. There are two steps in matrix multiplication: (1) determining whether multiplication will be defined or undefined and (2)</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">completing the multiplication.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Defined vs. Undefined Results from Matrix Multiplication The first step in matrix multiplication is determining if the result of matrix multiplication will be defined or</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">undefined and, if the result 1s defined, what the resulting matrix’s dimensions will be. To do this, we use the dimensions of the matrices and the following steps.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Write down the dimensions of the two matrices that you are multiplying together. For example,</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">if you are multiplying matrix A, a (1 X 2) matrix, and matrix B, a (2 x 3) matrix, we write:</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">AB = (1X 2) x (2x 3)</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Draw a box around the middle 2 numbers and see if those 2 numbers match. This tells you if the</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">matrix is defined or undefined. For our example, we would put a box like this:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">AB = (1 x/2) x (2|x 3) a.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Ifthe numbers do not match, the matrix is undefined. You can stop here, as there is no more math that needs to be done.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">b.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Ifthe numbers match, the matrix is defined. For a matrix to be defined, the number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Continue to step 3 to find the dimensions of the resulting matrix. Our example above is defined, so we will continue to step 3.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Bring down the first and last numbers (the 2 numbers outside the box) to find the dimensions of</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">the resulting matrix. With our example, we bring down the 1 and 3 to see the resulting matrix will</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">be a (1 X 3) matrix, as shown below:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(1 x|2) x (2|x 3)</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">NX</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">¢</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">AB = (1x3)</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">4.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Now that we know that the matrix AB is a (1 X 3) matrix. The second step, which we will learn next in this lesson, is to complete the matrix multiplication to find the values that will be in the matrix.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 4: Using the matrices shown below, which of the following is a (2 x 3) matrix?</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a=[5|</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.

BC</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C=[ 45 . |</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D. CA</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: To find which matrix will be a (2 x 3) matrix, we need to first know the dimensions of the matrices</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">presented in the question. Matrix A is (2 x 1), matrix B is (2 x 2), and matrix C is (2 x 3). Now, we need to set up the matrix multiplication for all the answer choices. We can start with answer choice A, matrix AB.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">AB = (2 x[1) x (2]x 2) The middle numbers in the box do not match, so AB is undefined.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 181</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Next, let’s try answer choice B, matrix CB.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">CB = (2 x[3) x (2|x 2) The middle numbers in the box do not match, so CB is undefined.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Next, let’s try answer choice C, matrix BC.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">wc = ax</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x axa)</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">NX</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">£</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">BC = (23)</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">BC is a (2 X 3) matrix, so C is correct. To finish explaining the answer choices, let’s go over answer choices D</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">as well. For answer choice D, we get</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">CA =(2 x[3) x (2]x 1) The middle numbers in the box do not match, so CA is undefined.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">BA is defined and is a (2 X 1) matrix. The only answer choice that results in a (2 X 3) matrix is BC, so the answer is C.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Questions like Example 4 appear occasionally on the ACT, so make sure you understand this before moving on to the next topic. You will more commonly use this skill as the first step in matrix multiplication, a topic that the ACT loves to test</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">in the more difficult questions that appear towards the end of the ACT Math test.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 182</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Matrices</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Matrix Multiplication — How To Find The Values In The Matrix Multiplying matrices is a tricky task that can be broken down into two major steps: (1) finding out if the matrix is defined or undefined (the skill we just learned on the last two pages) and (2) determining the resulting values in the matrix.

To find the values that go in matrix AB, we do a combination of multiplication and</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">addition. To start, let’s solve for top left spot in matrix AB, which is labeled as w below.

When multiplying matrices, always start at the left of the row and the top of the column. We multiply the 1st terms, 2 and 3, together.

To show you an example of what we mean, let’s see how a system of equations below can be represented in a matrix.</p>\n\n  <p>10x — 3y = 40</p>\n\n  <p>[1°</p>\n\n  <p>—3</p>\n\n  <p>40)</p>\n\n  <p>4x + 8y = 18</p>\n\n  <p>th x yy constants</p>\n\n  <p>As you can see, the system of equations can be represented by numbers in the matrix. The easiest type of matrix question on the ACT could ask you to understand this concept.</p>\n\n  <p>Matrix Dimensions The dimensions of a matrix refer to the number of rows and number of columns in the matrix. Matrix dimensions are written as (rows X columns). You can also think of this as (height x width). The examples below show you some matrices of various dimensions.</p>\n\n  <p>(2x1):[*]</p>\n\n  <p>(2x2): [73 fey</p>\n\n  <p>(1x3): [10 1 9]</p>\n\n  <p>ACT questions do not ask directly about matrix dimensions, but we need to understand matrix dimensions for the other topics that we will learn in this lesson.</p>\n\n  <p>Matrix Addition and Subtraction Matrix addition and subtraction is just simple arithmetic. Using matrices with the same dimensions, you complete the arithmetic for each position in the matrix. Take a look at the example below to see how it’s done!</p>\n\n  <p>[ 7|+ [“ i” ~ . 5 Top Left. -5+10=5</p>\n\n  <p>Top Right:</p>\n\n  <p>Bottom Left: —1+(—5) = -6</p>\n\n  <p>Bottom Right: 7 +(—2) = 5</p>\n\n  <p>To solve for top left position, use the values in the top left. The top left of the first matrix, —5, plus the top left in the second matrix, 10, gives us the value in the top left of the resulting matrix 5. We repeat this process for all other spots in the matrix to solve for the entire matrix.</p>\n\n</div>",

    "originalContent": "<div class=\"lesson-content\">\n  <h2 class=\"lesson-title\">Lesson: Miscellaneous Topics</h2>\n\n  <h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Miscellaneous Topics</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">As we said at the very start of this course, the ACT tests a TON of math topics from algebra, geometry, precalculus, and more. In this lesson, we will cover all the miscellaneous topics that we have not covered yet in this course. All topics in this lesson have appeared on the ACT before and will appear on the ACT again in the future. However, none of these miscellaneous topics are commonly tested, so you should</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">only focus on this lesson after you have mastered the other much more commonly tested chapters in the rest of these lessons. The topics in this lesson progress from the easier and more commonly tested topics to the more difficult and less commonly tested topics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Venn Diagrams A Venn diagram is a diagram of overlapping circles that helps visualize the logical relationship between sets</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">and their elements. You have likely seen a Venn diagram before, but if this concept is new to you, let’s use the example below to see how it works.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 1: Among a group of 23 students, 14 play tennis, 10 play soccer, and 4 play both. Of the 23</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">students, how many play neither tennis nor soccer?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A. 3</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B. 4</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C. 5</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">7</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Solution: To start, we can draw a Venn diagram and start labeling some numbers.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Soccer</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Tennis</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">I</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Both tennis</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Neither tennis</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">and soccer</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">nor soccer</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The left circle represents students who play tennis, so we need a total of 14 students inside that circle. The right circle represents students who play soccer, so we need a total of 10 students inside that circle. The overlapping region in the middle represents the students who play both soccer and tennis. We are told that</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">total is 4, so we can label the overlapping region with a 4. The area inside the rectangle and outside of the circles represents the students who play neither tennis nor soccer. We can fill in the other spots in the Venn diagram with the information from the question. We are told that there are 14 students total who play tennis and 4 students play both tennis and soccer, so we can subtract to find the number of students who play only tennis. Students who play only tennis = 14 — 4 = 10 We can put a 10 in the left circle, which shows that 10 students play only tennis.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 302</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Miscellaneous Topics</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We can repeat this process with the 10 total soccer players, again subtracting the 4 students who play both tennis and soccer to find the students who play only soccer. Students who play only soccer = 10 -4 =6 We can put a 6 in the right circle, which shows that 6 students play only soccer. We can see the updated Venn diagram below.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Soccer</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Tennis</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">|</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Both tennis</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Neither tennis</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">and soccer</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">nor soccer</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">So far, we have a total of 20 students (10 play only tennis, 4 play both, and 6 play only soccer). The question tells that there are 23 students, so we can find the number of students who neither tennis nor soccer. Students who play neither tennis nor soccer = 23 — 20 = 3 The answer is A. Anytime you see a Venn diagram question on the ACT, you should always draw the diagram as we did in this question.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Made-Up Math The ACT sometimes includes terms or equation that are entirely made-up. While these questions often confuse students on test day because the question includes a term or equation they have never used before, they are most commonly no different than normal functions questions. Let’s take a look at an example.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 2: If a®b = 3a? — 4b, what is the value of 5@9 ?</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A. 39</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B. 48</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C. 66</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">189</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The ® is not an actual math term. However, in the question, the a®b = 3a? — 4b is defined as a function. To solve, 5@9 we plug in 5 for a, 9 for b, and solve.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5 @9 = 3(5)? —4(9)</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5@9=75 —36</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">39</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">=9</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5@</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The answer is A. If you ever see a math term on the ACT that you have never seen before, do not freak out! It is probably just made-up math. Stay calm, read the question carefully, and solve.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 303</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Logic Logic questions ask you to think about a given statement and determine which answer choice must also be true.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 3: Given the true statement, “if it is Monday, there is bad traffic,” which of the following</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">statements must be true?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Ifitis not Monday, there is bad traffic.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Ifitis not Monday, there is not bad traffic.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Ifthere is bad traffic, it is Monday.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Ifthere is not bad traffic, it is not Monday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">These questions often seem confusing until you learn one quick tip: always look for the contrapositive statement. The contrapositive of a statement must always be true.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Original Statement: If A, then B</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Contrapositive Statement: If not B, then not A.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The contrapositive is created by switching the order of the original statement and negating both. Let’s apply</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">this to Example 3:</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Original Statement: If it is Monday, there is bad traffic.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Contrapositive Statement: If there is not be bad traffic, it is not Monday.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The answer is D. This trick always works for any logic question where the original statement is presented in the “if A, then B” pattern and asks which statement must be true.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">There can be other logic questions as well on the ACT where this trick does not work. If you see a logic question that is presented in another way, do your best to think through the question carefully. If you are unsure of what the answer is, bubble in your best guess and move on. Do not waste too much time on these types of questions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Pattern Spotting Pattern spotting questions present students with a question that seems very overwhelming to solve until you spot the pattern. Once you spot the pattern, solving is easy. The challenge is spotting the pattern. Let’s take a look at the example below to see how this works.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 4: The first three elements of a pattern are shown below. Each element is composed of small</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">squares with side lengths of 14 inches. Each element is a square with both dimensions 14 inches less than the dimensions of the next element. What is the perimeter, in inches, of the 5th element?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">70</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">126</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">280</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: Following the pattern, the 4th element has a length and width of 4 squares, and the 5th element has a length and width of 5 squares. The length of each side of the squares is 14 inches, so the side total side length for each side of the 5th element is 14 x 5 = 70 inches. The perimeter of the 5th element is all 4 sides added up. Since the shape here is a square, we can use the equation perimeter = 4s, where s is the length of one side of the square.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Perimeter = 4(70) = 280 The answer is D.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 304</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Miscellaneous Topics</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Mapping Mapping questions ask students to map movements and make a conclusion about the final position of an object. For these questions, we always recommend that you draw your own map of the movements.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 5: Jimmy normally drives 15 miles on the highway due east to get home from the gym, but the</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">highway is closed due to construction. To take a detour around the construction, Jimmy now needs to leave the gym and drive 2 miles north, turn right and drive 8 miles east, turn right and drive 5 miles south, turn right and drive 2 miles west, turn right and drive 3 miles north, and finally turn right and drive the rest</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">of the way home on the highway. Compared to when there is no construction, how many additional miles does Jimmy now have to drive to get home?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">12</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">14</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">18</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D. 29</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">To solve, we need to sketch out Jimmy’s route home. Normally, Jimmy’s normal route on the highway is shown by the thicker line in the middle. The thinner lines show the route</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Jimmy needs to take to get around</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">the construction and back on the highway.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Home</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Once we draw our own version of the map, solving this question is much easier. We need to find total number of miles that Jimmy drives when there is construction. To do this, we need to find out where Jimmy gets back on the highway.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We know the entire highway has a length of 15 miles. During his detour, Jimmy travels 8 miles east and then 2 miles west, so when he gets back on the highway, he has moveda total of 6 miles east. When he 1s getting on the highway at the end of the detour, he is 6 miles away from the gym. Therefore, he still has 9 miles left to drive on the highway to get home. Adding up all of the driving during the detour and the 9 miles on the highway, we can find the total distance Jimmy drives to get home. Jimmy’s Drive Home = 2+84+54+34+2+9=29 Jimmy drives a total of 29 miles to get home. Normally, Jimmy drive 15 miles on the highway to get home. To find how many additional miles he drives,</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">we subtract. 29 — 15 = 14. The answer is B.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 305</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Puzzles The ACT also includes a variety of puzzle questions. Puzzle questions require more problem-solving skills and less traditional math skills. These questions are often some of the most difficult to prepare for on test day and most commonly appear in the last 15 questions of the test. Puzzle questions can often be very time-consuming to solve, so we advise that you skip any puzzle questions you do not know how to solve immediately and save them for last.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 6: Office Supply Depot sells binders in two ways: a set of 10 binders in a large box and 1 binder</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">inasmall box. The large box and small box have the same width and length but different heights. The large box has a height of 12 inches, and the small box has a height of 2.5 inches. Matt has a spot in the</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">comer of his office to store binders. He is going to stack the boxes of binders to a height of 5.5 feet. What is the maximum number binders that he can store?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A. 66</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B. 62</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C. 60</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D. 52</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Solution: First, we need to convert the height of 5.5 feet to inches.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">12 inches</p>\n\n<ol class=\"instruction-list\">\n<li>5 feet x ————— = 66 inches</li>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">1 foot</p>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Now, we need to figure out the best way to maximize the binders that Matt can store. The large boxes are the more efficient way to store the binders, so we first want to stack as many large boxes as possible. Each large box has a height of 12 inches, so we can stack 5 large boxes. The 5 large boxes have a total height of 5 large boxes X 12 inches per box = 60 inches The 5 large boxes are 60 inches tall, so now we only have 6 inches left. We cannot add any more large boxes</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">because another large box would make the total height over 66 inches. Next, we have to find out how many small boxes we can add. We have 6 inches of space left and each small box is 2.5 inches, so we can add 2 small boxes. 2 small boxes xX 2.5 inches per box = 5 inches</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We cannot add a third small box because adding another small box would make the total height be over 66 inches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">With 5 large boxes and 2 small boxes, the total height is</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">5 large boxes(12 inches per box) + 2 small boxes (2.5 inches per box) = 65 inches So, how many binders do we have? Each large box holds 10 binders, and each small box holds 1 binder, so</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Total binders = 5(10) + 2(1) = 52 The answer is D. As you can see with this example, puzzle questions do not rely on traditional math skills and can be time-consuming. You will have more practice with puzzle questions in the practice questions.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 306</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Miscellaneous Topics</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Binomial Theorem and Pascal’s Triangle To expand binomials with powers higher than 2, such as (2x + 3)*, we need to know how to use the binomial theorem and Pascal’s triangle. If you have never done this before, this will be a bit tricky at first. However, you do need to know how to do this for some advanced questions that appear in the middle and end of the</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">ACT.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Pascal’s triangle (Shown below) gives us the coefficients for an expanded binomial in the form of</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(a+ b)\", where n is the row of the triangle. To draw Pascal’s triangle, we start with a 1 at the top. The outsides of the triangle are always 1, but the inside numbers are the sum of the two numbers above it. Each row is built from the row above it. The first 5 rows of Pascal’s triangle are shown below.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Row</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Exponent</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Pascal’s Triangle</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">0</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(a+b)°</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">4</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(a +b)?

To expand</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a polynomial in the form of (a + b)”, use the following steps.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Find the row of Pascal’s triangle to use based on the n-value (the power the binomial is raised</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">to). For example, for (2x + 3)*, n = 4, so we use 4th row of Pascal’s Triangle with 1, 4, 6, 4, and 1.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The numbers in Pascal’s triangle are the coefficients for each term. For (2x + 3)‘, the first term’s coefficient of 1, the second term’s coefficient of 4, third term’s coefficient is 6, and so on.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The first term is written as a\"b°, which simplifies to a”. For (2x + 3)*, the first term is (2x)*, which simplifies to 16x*.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">4.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Aswe move right, we subtract one from a’s exponent and add | to b’s exponent. So, the second</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">term is C x a\" 1b’, where C is the coefficient from Pascal’s triangle. For (2x + 3)*, the second term is 4(2x)?(3)1, which simplifies to 96x*. Notice how the coefficient of 4 comes from the second spot in the row in Pascal’s triangle.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">6.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Repeat the process for all middle terms. For (2x + 3)*, the third term is 6(2x)*(3)?, which simplifies to 216x*. The fourth term is 4(2x)1(3)?, which simplifies to 216x.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The last term is written as a°b\", which simplifies to b\". For (2x + 3)*, the final term is (3)*, which simplifies to 81.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The fully expanded version of (2x + 3)* is written below. (2x + 3)* = (2x)* + 4(2x)3(3)1 + 6(2x)7(3)? + 4(2x)'(3)? + (8)* Notice how the powers of the first term, 2x, count down and the powers of the second term, 3, count up and how the coefficients come from the 4th row of Pascal’s triangle. With all terms simplified, we get</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(2x + 3)* = 16x* + 96x? + 216x? + 216x + 81</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 307</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 7: When (4x — 3)? is expanded and all like terms are combined, what is the coefficient of the</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x? term?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A. 64</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B. 48</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C. 36</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">16</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: The x? term is the first term in the expanded binomial. The first term for a binomial to the third power is always a?. In this question, the a-value is 4x, so the first term is equal to (4x)? = 64x3 The answer is A. This is the easy version of these types of questions on the ACT, so a question like this can appear in the first 20 questions. Make sure you memorize the shortcut rules (steps 3 and 6 on the previous page) for how to find the first and last terms when expanding binomials to solve any question like this quickly and easily!</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 8: What is the coefficient for the x* term in (5x — 2)° when the term is expanded and all like</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">terms are combined?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A. —2,000</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B. —800</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C. —200</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D. 400</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: To find the coefficient of the x? term, we first need to find which row we are using from Pascal’s triangle. Since the binomial is to the 5th power, we use the 5th row. Now, we need to expand the binomial.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(5x — 2)° = (5x)° + 5(5x)4(—2)! + 10(5x)3 (—2)? + 10(5x)?2(—2)? + 5(5x)1(—2)* + (—2)5 Notice how the powers for the first term in the binomial, the 5x, decrease as we move to the right and the</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">powers for the second term in the binomial, the —2, increase. The coefficients come from the 5\" row of Pascal’s triangle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Here, we are looking for the x? term, so we only need to simplify the 10(5x)?(—2)?. Recognizing which term to simplify can save you a bunch of time on test day! If you get very skilled at the Binomial Theorem,</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">you can shortcut straight to solving for the x* term, which would mean here you would only have to write down and solve 10(5x)?(—2)? and none of the other terms we set up above. We have simplified the entire expression below. You should not take the time to do this on the ACT.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(5x — 2)° = 3,125x° — 6,250x* + 5,000x? — 2,000x? + 400x — 32 The coefficient of the x? term is —2,000.

We have already marked one edge,</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">so we can mark the 3 others. Be sure not to double count edges on a question like this! Edges so far = 7 Next, we mark the edges on the right side of the dice. We have already marked two edges, so we mark the 2 others left. Edges so far = 9</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">+</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">+</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Now for the hard part.

You need to know how to find vertical and horizontal asymptotes for a function.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Vertical Asymptotes</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">G) Vertical asymptotes occur when the denominator of a rational function is equal to zero. To find where the vertical asymptotes of a function are, we set the denominator equal to zero and solve. For example,</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">let’s consider the function f(x) below.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">PO) = 6x7 To find the vertical asymptotes, set the denominator equal to 0 and solve for the value(s) of x.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x*-—6x-7=0 Here, we have a quadratic, so we can factor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(x +1)(x</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">-—7) =0</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">To find the values of x, set each factor equal and solve. x+1=0</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x-7=0</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x=-1</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x=7</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The vertical asymptotes are atx = —1 and x = 7. Looking at the graph of this function, we can see the vertical asymptotes (shown as dotted lines). Notice how the graph approaches but never crosses the vertical asymptotes.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 10: On the graph of y = = in the standard (x, y) coordinate plane, where is the vertical</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">asymptote?</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Ax=-3</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Bxe=3</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Cx=2</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Dy=-</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: To find the vertical asymptote, set the denominator of the function equal to zero and solve. 3x -—9=0 3x =9 x=3</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">There is a vertical asymptote at x = 3.

To find horizontal asymptotes, we look for the degree (the highest power) in the numerator and in the denominator and remember</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">three simple rules:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Rule #1: If the degree of the denominator is larger than the degree of the numerator, the horizontal asymptote is always at y = 0.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Consider f («) shown below.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Z 3x2 ++x+10</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The degree of the numerator is 2 since the highest power is the 3x? term. The degree of the denominator, is 3 since the highest power is the 7x* term. The degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of denominator. So, f(x) has a horizontal asymptote is at y = 0. Take a look at the graph of f(x) to see what a horizonal asymptote at y = 0 looks like. Notice how the function never crosses the y = 0 line, which is the same as the x-axis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Rule #2: If the degree of the denominator is smaller than the degree of the numerator, there is NO horizontal asymptote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Consider g(x) shown below.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x +10</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">90) = Tay 2 The degree of the numerator is 3 since the highest power is the x? term. The degree of the denominator is 2 since the highest power is the 11x? term. The degree of the numerator is less than the degree of denominator. So, g(x) has no horizonal asymptote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Take a look at the graph of g(x). Notice how there is no horizonal asymptote. Functions with a lower degree in the numerator than the denominator have a slant asymptote. You do not need to know how to calculate slant asymptotes for the ACT.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 311</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Rule #3: If the degree of the numerator and denominator are equal, the horizontal asymptote is</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">found by dividing the leading coefficients of the polynomials.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Consider h(x) shown below.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">h(x) =</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">6x? — 2x* —3 2x3</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The degree of the numerator is 3 since the highest power is the 6x? term. The degree of the denominator is 3 since the highest power is in the 2x? term. Since the degrees of the numerator and denominator are equal, we use the ratio of the leading coefficients to find what the horizontal asymptote will be. The leading coefficients are the numbers in front of the highest power. In the numerator, the leading</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">coefficient is 6 from the 6x? term. In the denominator, the leading coefficient is 2 from the 2x? term. We divide the coefficients to find the horizontal asymptote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">So, h(x) has a horizontal asymptote is at y = 3.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Take a look at the graph of h(x) to see what a horizonal asymptote at y = 3 looks like. Notice how the function never crosses the y = 3 line, which is shown as a dotted line below.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">rack</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 11: The graph of the f(x) =</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">—3x348x4-7x 2x44+10x2-9</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">in the standard (x, y) coordinate plane has a</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">horizontal asymptote at what value?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">y=0</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">y=4</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">C. x= 4</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">D. There is no horizonal asymptote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: To find the horizontal asymptote, we need to find the degree of the numerator and denominator.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The degree of the numerator is 4 because we have a 8x* term. The highest power is not always listed first on the ACT, so be sure to look at all terms to find the highest power to find the degree. Make sure you don’t fall for the trick that we pulled in this question!</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The degree of the denominator is 4 because we have a 2x* term. The degrees of the numerator and denominator are equal, so we follow rule #3 to find the horizontal asymptote: divide by the leading coefficients of the terms with the highest power.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">In the numerator, the leading coefficient is 8 from the 8x* term. In the denominator, the leading coefficient is 2 from the 2x* term. We divide the coefficients to find the horizontal asymptote. y _ y) _</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">So, f(x) has a horizontal asymptote is at y = 4. The answer is B.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 312</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Miscellaneous Topics</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Polynomial Long Division & Synthetic Division A polynomial is math expression consisting of various terms. For example, 2x? + x? — 6x — 8 and x — 2 are both polynomials. Polynomial division is used to divide one polynomial by another. Polynomial division is not commonly tested on the ACT, but it is a topic that you should know just in case if you are aiming for top scores.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">To do polynomial division, there are two methods: (1) long division and (2) synthetic division. Let’s start with polynomial long division.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Polynomial Long Division Polynomial long division works in a very similar way as long division. If we are given polynomial like this</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">2x3? +x*2-—6x—-—8 x-2</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">we start by setting up long division. We put the dividend (the term being divided) underneath the bars on the right side and put the divisor (the term we are dividing by) on the left side. Doing this, we get</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x — 2| 2x3 + x? - 6x-8 The first step is to look at the first term of the dividend, which here is 2x3, and ask ourselves what we need to multiply the divisor, which here is x — 2, by to get the first term of the polynomial. In this case, we need to</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">multiply x — 2 by 2x? to get 2x3, so we put the 2x? on top. 2x?</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x — 2] 2x3 +x? — 6x - 8 Next, we multiply the divisor (x — 2) by the 2x? and write the product of those terms down below. 2x?</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x— 2] 2x3 + x? —6x-—8 2x3 — 4x2</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Now, we subtract the results from the first polynomial. Notice how the first term, the 2x?, cancels out and we are just left with 5x2. We then bring down the next term from the divisor, the —6x. 2x?</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x — 2| 2x3 + x? —6x-—8 —(2x3 — 4x?) a</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">5x* — 6x At this point, this is probably starting to feel like normal long division! Next, we ask ourselves what we need</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">to multiply x — 2 by to get 5x”, which is 5x. So, we put 5x on the top and repeat the previous steps. 2x* + 5x</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x — 2| 2x3 + x? —6x-—8 —(2x3 — 4x?) a</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">5x* — 6x</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">—(5x? — 10x) 4x —8</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 313</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">To finish up, we repeat this one final time. Since x — 2 would have to be multiplied by 4 to get 4x, we add a 4</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">to the top and solve to find the remainder.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">2x7 +5x+4</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">x — 2] 2x3 + x? —6x-—8 —(2x3 — 4x?) a</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">5x* — 6x —(5x? — 10x) 4x —8</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">—(4x</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">— 8)</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">0 <«—— Remainder</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The polynomial on top shows us what we get after the division. So here, we find that</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">2x2? +x? -—6x-—8 x—2</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">=2x*+5x+4</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The number that we get at the very ends on the bottom shows us the remainder. For this example, the remainder is 0. Most commonly, polynomial division questions on the ACT will have a remainder of 0.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Synthetic Division Synthetic division is a shortcut method for doing polynomial division, so it is much faster than the polynomial long division we just did. Let’s use the same example to see how to solve with synthetic division.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">2x2? + x*%-—6x—8 x—2</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">For synthetic division, we first take our polynomial, which here is 2x? + x* — 6x — 8 and write only the coefficients, as shown below. The 2 represents the 2x%, the 1 represents the x”, the 6 represents the 6x, and the —8 represents the —8.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1-6</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">—-8</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Next, we find the solution of the divisor. Since the divisor is x — 2, the solution is x = 2. We then put 2 on the left outside of the vertical line.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2|2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1-6</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">—8</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We then take the first number inside down below the line.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2}2</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">t</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1-6</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">—8</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Now, we multiply this number we moved to the bottom by the solution of the divisor (the 2 outside the vertical line) and bring that value up to the middle row of the next column. In this example, we multiply the 2 that we brought down by 2 to get 4.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2}2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1-6</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">7“</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">4</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">-314</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">-8</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Miscellaneous Topics</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Then, we add the numbers in the column. Here we add 1 + 4 to get 5. Write the 5 in the bottom row.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2|2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1-6</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">—8</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">4</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Now, we repeat the process. We multiply the 5 in the bottom row by 2 to get 10.

We then add the final column</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">to find the remainder.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2}2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1-6</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">-8</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">4</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">10</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">8</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">4</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">0</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">+— Remainder</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Y</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Quotient The bottom row shows the quotient and the remainder. The final number on the far right is always the remainder. Here, the remainder is 0. All the other numbers show the coefficients for the quotient. Here, the</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">coefficients 2 5 4 are shorthand for 2x? + 5x + 4. The terms increase in power from right to left, so the number just to the left of the remainder represents the constant (the number by itself with no x-term). As we</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">move to the left, we add power of x, so the 5 represent 5x and the 2 represents 2x?. As with long polynomial division, we find that</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">2x2 +x*2-—6x—8 x—2</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">=2x*+5x+4</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">If you see any polynomial division questions on the ACT, you can use either long polynomial division or synthetic division to solve. If you have never learned this topic before and you are aiming for 34-36 on the ACT Math, we would recommend that you go online to find some additional practice questions. Again, this has been rarely tested in the past, so it’s not likely you will see it on test day. With that being said, it’s best to learn it in case you see it on your ACT!</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 315</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>",

In this lesson, we will review the basics of these three types of sequences, the equations that you need to memorize, and how to solve any sequence questions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Arithmetic Sequences Arithmetic sequences are sequences using addition and subtraction between terms. The common difference, which is the number that is added or subtracted between consecutive terms, is constant. For</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">example, let’s consider the arithmetic sequence below:</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">4,8,12, 16, 20, 24...</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">For this sequence, the common difference is +4 because we see 4 is the difference between consecutive terms. For easier arithmetic sequence questions, which commonly appear in the first 30 questions of the ACT, you need to be able to find the common difference in a sequence and use that to find a later term in the sequence.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 1: In a certain arithmetic sequence, the Ist and 4th terms are 3 and 24 respectively. What is the</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Sth term of the arithmetic sequence?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">27</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B. 30</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C. 31</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D. 37</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: For any arithmetic sequence questions, we recommend drawing out the sequence and filling in any numbers in the sequence you are given. A simple visual can make it much easier to solve these questions correctly.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">24</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">lstterm</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">2ndterm</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">3rdterm</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">4thterm</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">5th term</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Now that we have a diagram, we can more easily see how to solve for the common difference. To go from the lst to 4th term, we must add the common difference 3 times. The total difference between the Ist and 4th terms is 21, so the common difference is 7. The find the 5th term, we add 7 to the 24 to get 31. The answer is C.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">More difficult arithmetic sequence questions will ask you to solve for a term much later in the sequence. What if you were asked to find the 88th term in the sequence above? You do not want to add the common difference over and over and over again... we need a faster way! To solve this quickly, we use the equation t, =t,+d(n-1) where ¢, is the first term in the sequence, d is the common difference, t,, is the nth term, and n is the term number. You need to memorize this equation for test day. Let’s use the equation to find the 88th term in the sequence for example 1. The first term is 3, the common difference is 7, and we are looking for the 88th term, so we get</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">tgs</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">=</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3+7(88-—1) = 612</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The 88th term in the sequence is 612.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 2: The 3rd and 5th terms in an arithmetic sequence are —4 and 11 respectively.

The common ratio, which is the number that each consecutive term is multiplied or divided by, is constant. For example, let’s</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">consider the geometric sequence below:</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3,6,12,24,48,96...</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">For this sequence, the common ratio is X 2 because we multiply by 2 between consecutive terms. For geometric sequence questions on the ACT, you need to find the common ratio and use that to find other terms in the sequence.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 3: The Ist term in a geometric sequence is 560 and the second term is —280.

To find a common ratio, you can take any term in a geometric sequence, here we will use —280, and divide it by the previous term, which here is 560. So, the common ratio</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">—280</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">is ——</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">560</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">=</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">1</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">—=</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">2°</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Once we know the common ratio, we can use it to find the other terms in the sequence.

The answer is B.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Geometric sequences questions are generally not too difficult. For geometric sequences, the ACT has never asked you to find a term way later in a sequence. Just in case they do, you can memorize the formula below.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">t,=t,xr1 where ¢, is the first term in the sequence, r is the common ratio, t, is the nth term, and n is the term number.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 233</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Recursive Sequences A recursive sequence is a sequence in which terms are defined using previous terms and a given</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">formula. In recursive sequences, we cannot find the current term until we know the previous term. We cannot find the 3rd term until we know the 2nd term, we cannot find the 4th term until we know the 3rd term, and so on. That means that we need to solve for the terms in a recursive sequence one term at a time. If you have never done recursive sequences before, that may all seem very confusing, so let’s use the example formula below to make it clearer. An =2An-1+2 nth term</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">and</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">rk</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">(n — 1)th term</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a, =3</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">k</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">lst term</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">A, 1s the nth term in the sequence, and a,_, is the previous term right before a,. In a recursive sequence, you</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">are always given the Ist term, which in this example is a, = 3. To solve for the 2nd term, we use the formula and plug inn = 2 and get a, = 2a,+2</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">In words, the formula says the 2nd term, az, is equal to 2 times the Ist term, a,, plus 2. Since we know that a, = 3, we can solve az.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a, = 2(3)+2=8 Now that we know the 2nd term, we can solve for the 3rd term, a3. Since we are solving for the 3rd term, we use the formula and n = 3 and get</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a, = 2a,+2 > az =2(8)+2=18 Below, we use the same steps to solve for the 4th term, a,, the 5th term, a;, and the 6th term, ag.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a, = 2a,+2 > a, =2(18)</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">+ 2 = 38</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a, = 2a,+2 > ay = 2(38)</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">+2 =78</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Ag = 2ae +2 > ag = 2(78)</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">+2 = 158</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We can continue this pattern as long as necessary to find the answer. Most recursive sequence questions on the ACT will ask you to solve for the 4th, 5th, or 6th term.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 4: A sequence is defined for all integers by s, = 3s,_;</h4>\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">10</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B. 38</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C..114</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">+n+5 ands, =1. What is s,?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">123</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: In order to find the 4th term, s,, we need to start by finding the 2nd term, then the 3rd, and then finally the 4th term. To solve for the 2nd term, we set n = 2 and use the formula and the 1st term, which the question tells us is equal to 1.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">So =35s,+24+5 > s,=301)+2+5</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">S, = 10</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Now that we know the 2nd term, we can find the 3rd term.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">S3 = 3s,+34+5 > s, =3(10)+3+4+5 Sz = 38</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Once we know the 3rd term, we can find the 4th term.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">S4 = 353+44+5 > s, = 3(388) +445</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">S4 = 123</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The 4th term is 123. The answer is D.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 234</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Sequences</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Explicit Formula for Recursive Sequences An explicit formula is an equation that gives the value of a term based on the position in the sequence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">With the explicit formula, you do not need to know the previous terms and can just input the value in the</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">equation to find the value. For example, if we had the explicit formula:</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Aa, =2n+5</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">We can find any nth term using the equation. To find the 4\" term, a,, we plug in n = 4 and solve. a4 = 2(4)+5=13 Some recursive sequences follow a distinct pattern can be expressed as an explicit formula. The most common way the ACT tests explicit formulas for sequences is to provide a recursive sequence and ask you to find the explicit formula.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 5: Given the recursive formula below, which of the following equations is a correct explicit</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">formula for the sequence?</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">A.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a, =10+4n</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">B.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a, =6+4n</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">C.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">an = —4+14n</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">D.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a, =14+4n</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a, = 10 An = An-1 +4</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: To solve, let’s start finding the values in the recursive formula. We already know the first term is 10, so when n = 1,a, = 10. We can find the following terms in the sequence. a, =a,+4 > a,=104+4= 14 a3</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">=a,+4</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">> az =144+4=18</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">a4=a3,;+4 > az =184+4=22</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">At this point, we can notice the pattern: the value increases by 4 as you go from one term to the next. This means that the slope of the equation must be 4, so we must see 4n in the explicit formula. We can eliminate answer choice C. To find the constant (the number) in the explicit formula, we can test using the point(s) that we found. An easy value to start with is a, = 10. If we plug inn = 1, the correct explicit formula must give a, = 10.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">For A: a, = 10+ 4(1) = 14</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">For B: a,</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">=6+4(1) = 10</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">For D: a,</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">= 144+ 4(1) = 18</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Only B gives us the correct value of 10, so we can tell that the answer is B. Notice that if we plug other values of n directly into the explicit equation, we get the values of az, a3, and a, that we solved for above. Shortcut Method: If you ever see a question like this on the ACT, start by using the Ist term in the</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">sequence as a test point. In Example 5, we are given a, = 10, so immediate plug inn = 1 to the explicit answer choices and eliminate any that do not give you 10. Often on the ACT, only 1 answer works with this shortcut method, and you can tell the correct answer without finding any other terms in the sequence. For the example above, we could eliminate A and D immediately. To then tell which answer choice is correct, find 2nd term and use that as a test point. Once we find a, = 14, only B works, so we can tell that the correct answer is B.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 235</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">math</p>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>",

A few common conversion factors you should know are listed below. 1 foot = 12 inches</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">1 yard = 3 feet</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">1 hour = 60 minutes</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">1 minute = 60 seconds</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">For other conversions, such as pounds to kilograms, the ACT provides the conversion factor as part of the</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">question.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<h4>Example 1: A string that is 10 feet and 3 inches long is cut into three pieces of equal length. What is the</h4>\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">length of each piece of string? A. 3 feetlinch</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">B. 3feet3 inches</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">C. 3 feetS inches</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">D. 3 feet 8 inches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Solution: First, we need to convert the original length of the string to inches. For a question like this, you need to convert the length to one unit before dividing. To convert 10 feet to inches, we multiply by 12: 10 feet x</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">12 inches 1 foot</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">= 120 inches</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">So, 10 feet and 3 inches has a total length of 123 inches. To find the length of each piece, we divide by 3: 123 inches</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">5</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">= 41 inches per piece</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Now, we need to convert 41 inches to feet. 36 inches = 3 feet, which leaves 5 inches leftover to get to 41 inches.

To solve questions involving unit conversion and areas or volumes correctly, convert the units BEFORE solving for any area or volume.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">For this example, we are asked to solve for square yards, so we need to first convert feet to yards: i</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">lyard _</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Length = 78 feet x S fest = 26 yards</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">Width = 36 feet x 3 S* = 12 yards feet Now that the units are converted to yards, we can find the area of the tennis court in square yards.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">A = lw = (36 yards)(12 yards) = 312 square yards The answer is A.</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">*Test-Day Tip: Anytime you see units written in bold, pay close attention and make sure you are solving for the correct units.

Let’s say that the metal pipe is 2 feet long (p = 2) and that we will cut it into 3 pieces (n = 3). From here, we can easily solve for x, the length of each piece in inches: 2 feet x 24 inches</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">12 inches 1 foot</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">= 24 inches</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">= 8 inches per piece</p>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">With the numbers we picked, we found that x = 8. From here, we plug our values of p = 2, = n = 3, and x = 8 into the answer choices to find out which equation is correct. Let’s confirm this works by plugging in our values to answer choice A.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">8</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">__ 12(2)</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">3</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">8=8</h3>\n\n<p class=\"lesson-text\">The equation works with our numbers, so we know that the answer is A.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">- 268</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\"></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"section-heading\">Lesson: Unit Conversion</h3>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>",
