Chapter 10: Ratios and Proportions
Ratios
We use ratios to make comparisons between two things. Ratios do not give the exact number of items but
instead allow us to concisely compare the relationship between two things at the same time.
As an example, if we have oranges and apples in a basket in the ratio of 2:3, it does not necessarily mean that
we have 2 oranges and 3 apples. Instead, the ratio tells us that for every 2 oranges, there are 3 apples. Asa
result, you can think of this ratio as 2x: 3x because we must multiply 2 and 3 by the same value to keep the
2:3 ratio. Using this “x” trick will help you on many ratio questions where you are given a ratio but not any

exact numbers.
On the ACT, you will need to solve ratio questions in four different ways. We will review the four types of
ratio questions below along with the methods you should use to solve them:

#1 - Ratio and a Total
Example 1: The ratio of red marbles to green marbles in a bag 1s 4:6. If there are a total of 80 marbles in
the bag and all of the marbles in the bag are red or green, how many of the marbles are red?
A.

8

B. 20

C. 32

D. 48

Solution: Method #1: The “x” trick. We can think of the ratio 4:6 as 4x: 6x, where the 4x represents the
red marbles and the 6x represents the green marbles.
Red Marbles + Green Marbles = 80
4x + 6x = 80
10x
= 80
x=8

To solve for the red marbles, we plug x = 8 back into the 4x.

Red Marbles = 4x = 4(8) = 32
The answer is C.

Method #2: Set up a Proportion. We can set up a proportion from the ratio. Since the ratio or red marbles
to green marbles is 4: 6, we know that
Red Marbles _ 4

Total Marbles

10

We know there are 80 total marbles, so we can set up an equation to solve for the unknown number of red
marbles.
x

4

80. 10
10x
= 320
x = 32
The answer is C.

#2 — Ratios as Proportions
Example 2: Beth is baking her famous chocolate cupcakes for her mother’s birthday party. For every 3

cupcakes, Beth uses 10 pieces of chocolate. If Beth needs to make 42 cupcakes for the party, how many
pieces of chocolate will she need to buy?
A.

42

B. 70

C.

126

D.

140

Solution: Set up the values from the ratio as a proportion. Here, we set up the proportion as
cupcakes

cupcakes

pieces of choclate __ pieces of choclate
Now, we can plug in the values from the question and solve.
3 cupcakes

_

10 pieces of chocolate

42 cupcakes

x pieces of chocolate

3x = 420
_ 420

x =—
= 140
3

The answer is D.

#3 — Comparing Across Ratios
Example 3: The ratio of
x to y is 3:4. The ratio of y to Zz is 2:10. What is the ratio of
x: z ?
A.

3:10

B. 3:20

C.

15:4

D. 4:15

Solution: We need to make the variable that appears in both ratios, y, have the same numerical value. To do
that, we multiply the second ratio by 2, so
XY

yiz

3:4

2:10

becomes
XIV

yiz

3:4

4:20

Now that the y-values are the same (both are equal to 4), we can compare across the ratios to find x: z.
x:zZ = 3:20
The answer is B.

#4 — Ratios and Geometry
Example 4: In rectangle ABCD, the ratio of the lengths of side AB to side BC is 8:5. If the total
perimeter of the rectangle is 156 feet, what is the length of the longer side of the rectangle?
A.

6

B.

12

C. 30

D. 48

Solution: To start, sketch out rectangle ABCD. We can think of the ratio as 8x: 5x instead of 8:5. We can
label the sides of our rectangles using 8x and 5~x as the side lengths.

8x

A
5x

B
5x

D

By

C

The perimeter of the rectangle is
8x + 8x +5x+
5x = 156
26x = 156
—_ 156 ©
x

26

Now that we have solved for x, we can solve for the longer sides of the rectangle.

Longer Sides = 8x = 8(6) = 48
The answer is D.

Proportions
On the ACT, you need to know the equations for two types of proportions: direct proportions and indirect
proportions.

Direct Proportion
In a direct proportion, y varies directly with x. In simpler terms, x and y will move together. As x increases,
y increases, and as x decreases, y decreases. The equation for direct proportions is

y =kx

(where k is a constant)

Example 5: If y varies directly with x and y = 27 when x = 3, what is the value of x when y = 90?
A.

10

B.

13

C. 20

D. 30

Solution: When solving proportions, we always start by solving for the constant k. We can solve for k using
the pair of x and y-values the question gives us.

27 = k(3)
k=9

Now, we know the equation for the proportion is y = 9x. To solve, plug y = 90 and solve for x.

90 = 9(x)
x=10
The answer is A.

Chapter 10: Ratios and Proportions

Indirect Proportion
In an indirect proportion, y varies inversely with x. In simpler terms, x and y will move opposite to one

another. As x increases, y decreases, and as x decreases, y increases. The equation for indirect proportions is:
_k

a
Example 6: If y varies inversely with the square of x and y = 45 when x = 2, what is the value of y
when x = 6?
A.

5

B.

15

C. 78

D.

112

Solution: Since y varies directly with the square of x, the indirect proportion equation looks like
k
y= y2

Be careful of changes like this, as 1t is a common way the ACT can make proportions questions more difficult.
We start by solving for k using the x and y-values the question gives us.
k

k = 180

We now know the indirect proportion equation for this question is y = =. To solve, we plug in x = 6 and
solve for y.
