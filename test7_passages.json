The <u id=\"q2\">“pectoral,” a kind of jewelry worn on one’s chest </u> depicts Egyptian symbols with gold and gems. Most strikingly, at the piece’s center is a beetle carved from an ethereal yellow-green material.\r\n[1] Originally, archaeologists identified the beetle as chalcedony, a quartz gemstone. [2] In 1996, <u id=\"q3\">likewise,</u> mineralogist Vincenzo de Michele noticed the beetle at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and suspected it wasn’t\r\nchalcedony. [3] After studying the beetle, he determined it to be 28 5-million-year-old glass. [4] De Michele then traced the glass to the Great Sand Sea of western Egypt, where pieces of it lay strewn across 6,500 square kilometers. [5] Glass is made by <u id=\"q4\">heating substances, such as,</u> \r\n\r\n\r\nsand. [6] Though lava and lightning strikes can create  <u id=\"q5\">glass the desert glass’s </u> traces of the elements iridium and osmium pointed <u id=\"q6\">to</u> an unearthly culprit: a meteoroid. [7] It’s true that the tremendous heat and pressure <u id=\"q7\"> around the globe of meteorite impacts in many places have created glass.</u> [8] But meteorites leave craters, and <u id=\"q8\">their was</u> no crater that could account for the desert glass. <u id=\"q9\"> </u>\r\n\r\nIn recent years, scientists John Wasson and Mark Boslough have <u id=\"q10\">put their research-whiz brains to work on a new explanation for</u> the desert glass.Intrigued by the 1994 collision of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter and a 1908 meteoroid airburst over a remote region of Russia <u id=\"q11\">that flattened 80 million trees but left no crater,</u> they ran sophisticated computer simulations. \r\n\r\nTheir conclusion: a meteoroid burned up in the atmosphere, <u id=\"q12\">but</u> its fireball reached Earth and scorched an expanse of sandstone to temperatures above 1,800°C. <u id=\"q13\"> </u> \r\n\r\nImagination can take the <u id=\"q14\">through</u>there. Some three thousand years ago, an artisan admired a piece of desert <u id=\"q15\">glass; so gorgeous that,</u> with a little carving, it would befit a great pharaoh.",

Bartik and her team figured out how to set ENIAC’s 3,000 switches and hundreds of connection cables so that it could run each calculation correctly. Programming ENIAC required enormous patience. To change a program, the women had to rewire the machine manually by manipulating punch cards and switches in a series of wiring boards.

Representative of Howe’s style at the time, the painting featured sharp, angular shapes in rich pink, blue, and purple hues that geometrically depicted five dancers.
