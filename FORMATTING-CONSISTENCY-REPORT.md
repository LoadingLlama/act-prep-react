## 🔧 ISSUES FOUND & FIXES APPLIED

### Issue 1: Underlined Text Mismatch (12 questions)

**Discovered:** Tests 6 & 7 had mismatched content between `<u>` tags and `underlined_text` field

**Questions Affected:**
- Test 6: Q3, Q21, Q41, Q44, Q69 (5 questions)
- Test 7: Q6, Q14, Q21, Q28, Q39, Q49, Q63 (7 questions)

**Problem:** Period punctuation included in `<u>` tag but not in `underlined_text` field

**Example:**
```
<u>a meteoroid.</u>   ← Tag includes period
underlined_text: "a meteoroid"   ← Field missing period
```

**Fix Applied:** Updated all `underlined_text` fields to match `<u>` tag content exactly (including punctuation)

**Script:** `FIX-UNDERLINED-TEXT-CONSISTENCY.mjs`

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (12/12 fixed)

---

### Issue 2: Placeholder Text in Organizational Questions (54 questions)

**Discovered:** Tests 1, 4, 5 had incorrect placeholder text in `underlined_text` field for organizational questions

**Questions Affected:**
- Test 1: 8 questions (Q14, Q15, Q30, Q42, Q45, Q60, Q65, Q75)
- Test 4: 25 questions (Q3, Q6, Q12, Q15, Q16, Q22, Q24, Q29, Q30, Q31, Q38, Q40, Q45, Q48, Q54, Q56, Q57, Q58, Q60, Q64, Q66, Q69, Q71, Q74, Q75)
- Test 5: 21 questions (Q4, Q10, Q14, Q15, Q21, Q28, Q29, Q33, Q38, Q39, Q43, Q44, Q45, Q51, Q52, Q53, Q56, Q60, Q66, Q70, Q73)

**Problem:** Organizational questions (sentence placement, essay purpose, paragraph division) had populated `underlined_text` field with placeholder values like:
- "PASSAGE QUESTION"
- "[Paragraph division question]"
- "[Addition consideration]"
- "[Essay purpose question]"

**Issue:** Tests 2, 3, 6, 7 correctly left these fields NULL, but Tests 1, 4, 5 incorrectly populated them

**Example (Test 4 Q15):**
```
Question: "Suppose the writer wants to divide this paragraph..."
underlined_text: "[Paragraph division question]"  ← Should be NULL
<u> tag: NOT PRESENT  ← Correct, organizational question
```

**Fix Applied:** Removed all placeholder text from `underlined_text` field where NO `<u>` tag exists

**Script:** `FIX-ENGLISH-FORMATTING-CONSISTENCY.mjs`

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (54/54 fixed)
