Chapter 11: Word Choice
Word choice questions on the ACT ask you to select which word is correct. For these questions, read
the sentence and sentence(s) before and after for context to tell which word is correct.
Some word choice questions may test your knowledge of the definitions of words as well. Ifa question
is testing your vocabulary, do not assume the hardest vocabulary word is correct. Sometimes, the
ACT puts challenging words on the test that you need to know and other times the challenging words
are incorrect answers. On test day, do the best you can with the words that you know. If you know
that a word works, pick that word no matter how easy or hard the word seems. If you do not know a
word and have to guess, take your best guess and move on.
Word choice questions will always have 4 words with no punctuation or the same punctuation and will

ask you, “which choice is clearest and most precise in context?” An example is below:

Adding solar panels to your house can

emit huge savings on energy bills each

Which choice is the clearest and most
precise in context?
A. NO CHANGE

month.

B. claim
C. gift

D. result in
The best way to answer these questions is to read for context, plug each word into the sentence, and

pick the one that makes the most sense in the context. Here, the correct answer is “D” since “result in” is
the only answer choice that works in the context of the sentence.
